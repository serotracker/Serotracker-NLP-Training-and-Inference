{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in school settings during the second wave in Berlin, Germany: a cross-sectional study. <h4>Background: </h4> School attendance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is intensely debated. Modelling studies suggest that school closures contribute to community transmission reduction. However, data among school-attending students and staff are scarce. In November 2020, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany. <h4>Methods:</h4> Students and school staff were examined, oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples collected, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members performed self-swabs. Individual and institutional infection prevention and control measures were assessed. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected household members were re-tested after one week. Findings: 1119 participants were examined, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff, and 625 household members. Participants reported mainly cold symptoms (19.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight of 24 classes affecting each 1-2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2.7% (95%CI, 1.2-5.0%; 9/338), 1.4% (0.2-5.1%; 2/140), and 2.3% (1.3-3.8%; 14/611) among students, staff and household members, respectively, including quarantined persons. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic. Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask use in school, way to school on foot, and case-contacts outside school. IgG antibodies were detected in 2.0% (0.8-4.1%; 7/347), 1.4% (0.2-5.0%; 2/141) and 1.4% (0.6-2.7%; 8/576), respectively. For three of nine households with infection(s) detected at cross-sectional assessment, origin in school seemed possible. After one week, no school-related, secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1.1%. Interpretation: These data suggest that school attendance under preventive measures is feasible, provided their rigorous implementation. In balancing threats and benefits of open versus closed schools during the pandemic, parents and society need to consider possible spill-overs into their households. Deeper insight is needed into the infection risks due to being a schoolchild as compared to attending school. Funding: Senate of Berlin.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "High prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the Xikrin of Bacaja (Kayapo) indigenous population in the brazilian Amazon. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached the Brazilian Amazon and spread among indigenous populations. In the present study, we demonstrate a high prevalence of infection among the Xikrin of Bacaja people (Kayapo). A sample of 100 individuals of both sexes (51 men and 49 women) with ages ranging from 2 to 82 years were clinically evaluated and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Among all investigated individuals, 58 were IgG-reactive (58 %) by a rapid test, and 73 (73 %) were reactive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with no difference between sexes. Oxygen saturation ranged from 82 to 99 %, with the lowest value observed in a two-year-old girl. The results show that as expected, SARS-CoV-2 infection rapidly reached more than 70 % of the population, most likely because of the difficulties of maintaining social distance due to cultural characteristics. These results highlight the importance of indigenous health policies as a means of minimizing the impact of the pandemic on these communities.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Saudi Arabia have imposed timely restrictions to minimize the infection spread, lower the risk for vulnerable groups, and reduce the pressure on healthcare services. The effectiveness of these measures has not been assessed comprehensively and, thereby, remains uncertain. Besides monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed by molecular assays, the seroprevalence can serve as an indicator for the incidence rate among the general population. This study aimed to evaluate seroprevalence status of all healthy blood donors who attended one of the main largest hospital located in the western region of Saudi Arabia from 1 January to 31 May 2020. The study period covered two months prior to reporting the first COVID-19 case in the country on 2 March 2020. Importantly, it covered the period when \"lock-down type\" measures have been enforced. Samples were subjected to in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and microneutralization (MN). The sero statuses of all samples were confirmed negative, demonstrating the lack of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors during COVID-19 lockdown period.

{"text": "Blood donor surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity. Background/Case Studies: Blood donor based serosurveillance is a convenient and cost-effective strategy to monitor the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and allows the detection of asymptomatic and recovered cases. The RESPONSE (REDS-IV-P Epidemiology, Surveillance and Preparedness of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic) study conducted monthly cross-sectional serosurveys of 1000 routinely obtained donor samples in 6 metropolitan regions (see table). Study Design/Methods: Samples were captured monthly from March or April through June 2020. Siteswere selected based on reports of epidemic activity or as low prevalence control regions. Donations from COVID- 19 convalescent plasma donors were excluded. Coded samples, with routinely collected demographic data and zip code of residence, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Ortho VITROS anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 Total Ig (data reported below) with planned confirmation of reactivity on Roche Elecsys NC Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Results/Findings: Table 1 shows donor seroreactivity with 95% CI. For all sites, seroreactivity was <1.0% (range 0.1%-0.9%) at the beginning of the surveillance period. Donor seroreactivity in New York City (NYC) was about 10-fold higher in April through June as compared to March and was much higher than in other locations. There were modest increases in seroreactivity over the study timeframe for all other sites. Conclusion(s): Modest increases in seroreactivity from baseline were found in all sites, with the largest increase in NYC. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of routinely obtained blood donor samples allows for detection of asymptomatic and recovered COVID-19 cases and enables future estimation of infection incidence by geographic and other demographic parameters. This approach will be used in a significantly expanded CDC National serosurveillance study involving all 50 states over 18 months.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers of a large COVID Hospital in Rome reveals strengths and limits of two different serological tests. In several hospitals worldwide, healthcare workers are currently at the forefront against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home. Between June 4 and July 3 2020, an investigation was carried out to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as gold standard. Four thousand, seven hundred seventy-seven participants were enrolled. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using venous blood test, with a significant difference between the two (p < 0.05). POC sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%).

{"text": "A longitudinal seroprevalence study in a large cohort of working adults reveals that neutralising SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies persist for at least six months independent of the severity of symptoms. <h4>Background</h4> In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity. <h4>Methods</h4> We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. <h4>Findings</h4> We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG-borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies. <h4>Interpretation</h4> RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection. <h4>Funding</h4> This study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020 0225 104). <h4>Key points</h4> Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before the study</h4> At the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the interpretation of the antibody\u2019s qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> We provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population. <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in low-prevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first months, assays targeting these antigen specificities \u2013 in contrast to RBD-specific antibody measurements \u2013 are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild COVID-19.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVES: To study the percentage seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 to understand the pandemic status and predict the future situations in Ahmedabad., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTINGS: Field area of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation., PARTICIPANTS: More than 30 000 individuals irrespective of their age, sex, acute/past COVID-19 infection participated in the serosurvey which covered all the 75 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) across 48 wards and 7 zones of the city. Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals., INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation., RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs., CONCLUSIONS: The results of serosurveillance suggest that the population of Ahmedabad is still largely susceptible. People still need to follow preventive measures to protect themselves till an effective vaccine is available to the people at large. The data indicate the possibility of vanishing immunity over time and need further research to cross verify with scientific evidences. Copyright \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

BACKGROUND: Decisions about the continued need for control measures to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design., METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382., FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time., INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards., FUNDING: Department of Health and Social Care.

Introduction: During the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, occupational health physicians worked to respond to different needs of workers, employers, and health authorities. In collaboration with the Prevention Department of the Veneto region of Italy, a survey was promoted in nine manufacturing companies in the province of Padua, to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic SarsCov-2 virus and the immunological status of 1,267 workers. Scope: The study was aimed at verifying the effectiveness of measures to contain the virus spread among workers in the workplace as required by the agreement between the social partners signed on March 14, 2020. Methods: The survey was carried out at workplaces by trained health physicians and almost all company workers enrolled on a voluntary basis. Each worker was tested for viral RNA using nasopharyngeal swab and for IgM and IgG antibodies by drawing venous or capillary blood, according to the availability of tests at that difficult period. Results: Swab-positive workers were 0.3%, and subjects with positive serological tests were 1.6% of the total workers examined. Discussion: The diagnostic test is based on the search for viral RNA through nasopharyngeal swab. To evaluate the immunological status of workers the CLIA or Elisa quantitative serological test should be preferred. Measures to contain the virus spreading at the workplace seem to be effective, as working settings do not entail any additional risk of SarsCov-2 infection.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave., METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.

Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better estimate infection across many geographic regions., Objective: To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the US and assess changes over time., Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated, cross-sectional study conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories. Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13, August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to September 24, 2020., Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >=65 years), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status., Results: Of 177919 serum samples tested, 103771 (58.3%) were from women, 26716 (15.0%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47513 (26.7%) from persons 65 years or older, and 26290 (14.8%) from individuals living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over 4 collection periods ranged from less than 1% to 23%. In 42 of 49 jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across all periods, fewer than 10% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions and varied across sites., Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found that as of September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by jurisdiction.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and transmission risk factors among high-risk close contacts: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The proportion of asymptomatic carriers and transmission risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among household and non-household contacts remains unclear. In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore, identified between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with the index COVID-19 case. Non-household close contacts were defined as those who had contact for at least 30 min within 2 m of the index case. All patients with COVID-19 in Singapore received inpatient treatment, with access restricted to health-care staff. All close contacts were quarantined for 14 days with thrice-daily symptom monitoring via telephone. Symptomatic contacts underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Secondary clinical attack rates were derived from the prevalence of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts. Consenting contacts underwent serology testing and detailed exposure risk assessment. Bayesian modelling was used to estimate the prevalence of missed diagnoses and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors., FINDINGS: Between Jan 23 and April 3, 2020, 7770 close contacts (1863 household contacts, 2319 work contacts, and 3588 social contacts) linked to 1114 PCR-confirmed index cases were identified. Symptom-based PCR testing detected 188 COVID-19 cases, and 7582 close contacts completed quarantine without a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Among 7518 (96.8%) of the 7770 close contacts with complete data, the secondary clinical attack rate was 5.9% (95% CI 4.9-7.1) for 1779 household contacts, 1.3% (0.9-1.9) for 2231 work contacts, and 1.3% (1.0-1.7) for 3508 social contacts. Bayesian analysis of serology and symptom data obtained from 1150 close contacts (524 household contacts, 207 work contacts, and 419 social contacts) estimated that a symptom-based PCR-testing strategy missed 62% (95% credible interval 55-69) of COVID-19 diagnoses, and 36% (27-45) of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic. Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 5.38 [95% CI 1.82-15.84]; p=0.0023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (7.86 [3.86-16.02]; p<0.0001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 3.92 [95% CI 2.07-7.40], p<0.0001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (2.67 [1.21-5.88]; p=0.015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (3.07 [1.55-6.08]; p=0.0013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Among both household and non-household contacts, indirect contact, meal sharing, and lavatory co-usage were not independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission., INTERPRETATION: Targeted community measures should include physical distancing and minimising verbal interactions.

{"text": "Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Kenyan blood donors. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa is poorly described. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya was reported on March 12, 2020 and an overwhelming number of cases and deaths were expected but by July 31, 2020 there were only 20,636 cases and 341 deaths. However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community remains unknown. We determined the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG among blood donors in Kenya in April-June 2020. Crude seroprevalence was 5.6% (174/3098). Population-weighted, test-performance-adjusted national seroprevalence was 4.3% (95% CI 2.9-5.8%) and was highest in urban counties, Mombasa (8.0%), Nairobi (7.3%) and Kisumu (5.5%). SARS-CoV-2 exposure is more extensive than indicated by case-based surveillance and these results will help guide the pandemic response in Kenya, and across Africa.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and their neonates represent two vulnerable populations highly susceptible to viral infections with an interdependent immune system. The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied., OBJECTIVES: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates., STUDY DESIGN: Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welch's two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welch's two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels., RESULTS: Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies. Copyright \u00a9 2021.

{"text": "First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan COVID-19 situation is exceptional for Central America. The government restricts testing and testing supplies, and the true extent of the coronavirus crisis remains unknown. Dozens of deaths have been reported among health-care workers. However, statistics on the crisis' effect on health-care workers and their risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers and to examine correlations with risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidities. Study participants (N = 402, median age 38.48 years) included physicians, nurses and medical assistants, from public and private hospitals, independent of symptom presentation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on saliva samples using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. A questionnaire was employed to determine subjects' COVID-19-associated symptoms and their vulnerability to complications from risk factors such as age, sex, professional role and comorbidities. The study was performed five weeks into the exponential growth period in Nicaragua. We discovered that 30.35% of health-care workers participating in our study had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large percentage (54.92%) of those who tested positive were asymptomatic and were still treating patients. Nearly 50% of health-care workers who tested positive were under 40, an astonishing 30.33% reported having at least one comorbidity. In our study, sex and age are important risk factors for the probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with significance being greatest among those between 30 and 40 years of age. In general, being male resulted in higher risk. Our data are the first non-governmental data obtained in Nicaragua. They shed light on several important aspects of COVID-19 in an underdeveloped nation whose government has implemented a herd-immunity strategy, while lacking an adequate healthcare system and sufficient PPE for health-care workers. These data are important for creating policies for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence in blood donors of Catalonia (Spain): Before and after the first wave. Background: In March 16 2020, total confinement of the Spanish population was implemented in order to mitigate expansion of SARS-CoV-2. By May 15, cumulative incidence (CI) of confirmed cases in Spain were higher than 500 per 100,000. In Catalonia, CI was 756 per 100,000, with uneven distribution among the four provinces: 321 in Tarragona, 451 Lleida, 660 in Girona, and 1042 in Barcelona, two-fold the mean Spanish CI. However, these figures probably underestimated the real exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among general population. Blood donors (BD) have been in the past a valuable sentinel population to assess prevalence and change in trends of emerging infectious diseases in asymptomatic individuals. Archive samples from blood donations provide at present the opportunity to monitor evolution of and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthy individuals. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to assess exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Catalan blood donors before and after the first wave Methods: Seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated in two periods: February 29 to March 9 2020 (N = 6,930), and May 16 to June 17 2020 (N = 6,829). Blood donations samples were analyzed for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies (Wantai ELISA test: all samples in the first period, 2,964 samples in the second period) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Euroimmun ELISA test: 3,855 samples of the second period). Samples positive for total antibodies in the first period were also tested for the presence of IgM (Wantai ELISA test). Demographic data (age, gender, postal code of residence) were recorded before anonymization and testing. This study was approved by the Vall d'Hebron Hospital IRB. Result(s): BD included in the two periods were comparable in age (44+/-13 years), gender (50.6% males) and represented the four provinces in Catalonia proportionally to the number of inhabitants: Barcelona 66.8% samples in March and 56.6 in May- June; Girona 12.6% and 17.3%; Lleida 11.3% and 14.5%; Tarragona 9.2% and 11.6%, in each period respectively. The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 in March was 0.25% (17/6,930; S/co value 4.1+/-4.0), equally distributed among provinces (0.22% Barcelona, 0.34% Girona, 0.31% Lleida, 0.26% Tarragona). Five of the 17 samples were also IgM positive (3 in Barcelona, 1 in Girona, 1 in Lleida), thus showing true exposure to SARS-CoV-2. False positive reactivity cannot be ruled out in the 12 IgM negative samples. Conversely, in the second period of the study (May-June), the overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (379/6,829; CI95% 5.0% > 6.1%), with similar results obtained with Wantai total antibodies (5.77%, CI95% 4.9% > 6.6%; S/Co 11.6+/-5.4) and Euroimmun IgG (5.41%, CI95% 4.7% > 6.15; S/ Co 4.2+/-2.4). No differences were found in age or gender between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative BD (42+/-13 vs 43+/-13 years; 50% vs 51% males, respectively). As per the four provinces, the SARS-CoV-2 exposure was distributed unequally: 7.69% Barcelona, 3.47% Girona, 2.65% Lleida, 2.02% Tarragona. The exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Barcelona was significantly higher than in the rest of the provinces (P < 0.001). Summary/Conclusions: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among BD after the first wave was 5.6%, showing that the number of asymptomatic cases or not diagnosed inflections was at least 7-fold higher than the reported confirmed CI. Exposure found in the four Catalan provinces was proportional to the respective CI. Conversely, low seroprevalence found just before the first wave indicate that explosive expansion of the virus in Catalonia started end February 2020. Blood donors are an accessible sentinel population useful for monitoring virus circulation, and thus helping health authorities modulate anti-SARS-CoV-2 interventions.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Validation of COVID-19 serologic tests and large scale screening of asymptomatic healthcare workers. Objectives: Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an important element in the fight to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. Design and Methods: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. Result(s): Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. Conclusion(s): Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence. The use of an indeterminate result from parallel orthogonal testing allows for the follow-up and re-testing, which helps resolve discrepancies between assays.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Despite the vast majority of individuals succumbing to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are elderly, infection fatality rate (IFR) estimates for the age group 70 years older are still scarce. To this end we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among retired blood donors and combined it with national COVID-19 survey data to provide reliable population-based IFR estimates for this age group., METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing. Overall, 1,201 (37.5%) individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Wantai) and compared to 1,110 active blood donors age 17-69 years. Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively. Using available population data on COVID-19 related fatalities, IFRs for patients age 70 years or older and for 17-69 years were estimated at 5.4% (95% CI: 2.7%-6.4%) and 0.083% (95% CI: 0.054%-0.18%), respectively. Only 52.4% of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive retired blood donors reported having been sick since the start of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IFR in the age group above 69 years is estimated to be 65 times as high as the IFR for people age 18-69 years.

The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study subjects were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job duties and locations, COVID-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with COVID-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 2,992 tested individuals, a total 2,924 with complete data were included in the analysis. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified.

OBJECTIVES: To avoid the significant risks posed by the use of COVID-19 serology tests with supply chain constraints or poor performance characteristics, we developed an in-house SARS-CoV-2 total antibody test. Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota., METHODS: Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4 - 69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our test's clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients >14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity.

{"text": "611 Racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Objective: There is growing interest in identifying individuals with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is especially important in pregnancy due to concerns for adverse pregnancy outcomes and possible need for increased surveillance in infected women. Prior reports on differences in racial, ethnic and socioeconomic prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are based on detection of viral RNA in clinical specimens. Disease confirmation via antibody status may be a more accurate method to assess susceptibility in pregnancy since it represents both present and past infection. This study aims to correlate racial, ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 antibody results in pregnancy. Study Design: This is a retrospective chart review of women who were admitted to L&D in seven hospitals in the Northwell Health System in NY state between 5/27/20 to 8/23/20. Women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were included. Race and ethnicity were categorized into the following groups: non-Hispanic African-American, Asian, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic and Other/Multiracial. Socioeconomic status was categorized to low and middle/high groups based on medical insurance. Categorical data were analyzed using 2-tailed chi square tests with adjusted standardized residuals to detect differences between groups. Result(s): Of 2921 women with available SARS-CoV-2 antibody results, 446 (15.3%) were seropositive and 2475 (84.7%) were seronegative. The racial, ethnic and socioeconomic frequencies are presented in the tables. Non-Hispanic African-American and Hispanic women had a higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rate while Asian and non-Hispanic White women had a lower seroprevalence rate, p=0.00. Women in the low socioeconomic group were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 compared to women in the middle/high socioeconomic group, p=0.00. Conclusion(s): Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy may be affected by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Our findings are consistent with those of prior studies and support the presence of racial disparities in risk for infection.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in health care workers of the Veneto Region. The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called MaglumiTM 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.

{"text": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgA and IgG Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers. Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been spreading rapidly across the world. A nucleic acid real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal samples is the standard method for the diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, many limitations of the RQ-PCR tests make them unsuitable for the simple and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some individuals with COVID-19 present an asymptomatic infection. Thus, assessing the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs), is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the current preventive measures. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are needed to quickly identify a large number of asymptomatic carriers to prevent the further spread of the virus and assess level of possible serological immunity in a community. Method Between April 18 and June 17, 2020, 330 HCWs from five Madinah region-affiliated hospitals underwent a seroprevalence screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]M/IgA and IgG) using indirect ELISA testing. Result Among the 330 samples, 80 (24.24%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and/or IgG antibodies. There were no significant differences observed in the seroprevalence among the different occupations of the HCWs (excluding the pharmacists) with respect to the percentage of their seropositive samples. Conclusion The current study presented the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG antibodies in HCWs. The regular screening of HCWs for these antibodies is necessary; subsequently, a molecular test is recommended for those with seropositive (IgM, IgA, and IgG) samples to assess their viral load and potential shedding.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "High Prevalence of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection in Hemodialysis Patients Detected Using Serologic Screening. BACKGROUND: Strategies to minimize the risk of transmission and acquisition of COVID-19 infection in patients with ESKD receiving in-center hemodialysis have been rapidly implemented across the globe. Despite these interventions, confirmed COVID-19 infection rates have been high in the United Kingdom. Prevalence of asymptomatic disease in an adult hemodialysis population has not been reported. Also, to our knowledge, the development of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been previously reported in this population. Although serologic testing does not provide information on the infectivity of patients, seroprevalence studies may enable investigation of exposure within dialysis units and hence, assessment of current screening strategies., METHODS: To investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a hemodialysis population, we used the Abbott IgG assay with the Architect system to test serum samples from 356 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies., RESULTS: Of 356 patients, 121 had been symptomatic when screened before a dialysis session and received an RT-PCR test; 79 (22.2% of the total study population) tested positive for COVID-19. Serologic testing of all 356 patients found 129 (36.2%) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Only two patients with PCR-confirmed infection did not seroconvert. Of the 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 52 (40.3%) had asymptomatic disease or undetected disease by PCR testing alone., CONCLUSIONS: We found a high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. Serologic evidence of previous infection in asymptomatic or PCR-negative patients suggests that current diagnostic screening strategies may be limited in their ability to detect acute infection.

Population prevalence of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), varies by subpopulation and locality. U.S. studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have examined infections in nonrandom samples (1) or seroprevalence in specific populations* (2), which are limited in their generalizability and cannot be used to accurately calculate infection-fatality rates. During April 25-29, 2020, Indiana conducted statewide random sample testing of persons aged >=12 years to assess prevalence of active infection and presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; additional nonrandom sampling was conducted in racial and ethnic minority communities to better understand the impact of the virus in certain racial and ethnic minority populations. Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse to reflect state demographics using an iterative proportional fitting method. Among 3,658 noninstitutionalized participants in the random sample survey, the estimated statewide point prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.54); 44.2% of these persons reported no symptoms during the 2 weeks before testing. The prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, indicating past infection, was 1.09% (95% CI = 0.76-1.45). The overall prevalence of current and previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana was 2.79% (95% CI = 2.02-3.70). In the random sample, higher overall prevalences were observed among Hispanics and those who reported having a household contact who had previously been told by a health care provider that they had COVID-19. By late April, an estimated 187,802 Indiana residents were currently or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (9.6 times higher than the number of confirmed cases [17,792]) (3), and 1,099 residents died (infection-fatality ratio = 0.58%). The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections. Given the large number of persons who remain susceptible in Indiana, adherence to evidence-based public health mitigation and containment measures (e.g., social distancing, consistent and correct use of face coverings, and hand hygiene) is needed to reduce surge in hospitalizations and prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Serologic Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Hemodialysis Centers: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) are highly vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial chest computed tomography (CT). If patients developed symptoms after initial screening was negative, a repeat CT was obtained. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with two consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020 antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients., EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody test results for SARS-CoV-2., OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings., ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to those with infection detected by positive serology test results., RESULTS: Among 1027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among these 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on chest CT compared to 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and they were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure., LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations., CONCLUSIONS: Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal chest CT and selective NAT.

BACKGROUND: Thousands of medical staff had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with hundreds of deaths reported. Such loss could be prevented if there is a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHOD(S): Using CHO cell expressed full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreaks or during the outbreak, and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULT(S): The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day one after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during the hospitalization and after been discharged for two weeks. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 out of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and one out of five nucleic acid test-negative \"Close contacts\" of COVID-19 patient.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by nucleic acid and antibody testing as well as its contribution to mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019., RECENT FINDINGS: Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the firstly developed and most widely used diagnostic technique for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAT assays is always unsatisfactory, mainly due to insufficient viral RNA in samples, especially when upper respiratory samples were used. Compared with NAT assays, serological tests are more convenient and less dependent on the quality of sample collection. But the sensitivity of antibody assays varies largely to test samples collected at different time after onset of symptoms. The diagnostic sensitivity can be significantly improved by combination of RNA and antibody testing. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccines, population prevention results mainly from timely triage and quarantine of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Thus, extensive testing with NAT and antibody assays simultaneously is very important to constrain coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic., SUMMARY: Viral RNA testing combining with serological testing could improve the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has great value for clinical practice and public health.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Homeless Shelter Characteristics and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. INTRODUCTION: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators., RESULTS: A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In more than 80% of tested patients, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was launched on March 30, 2020 by the French society of dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations., RESULTS: We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations (58.5% females, median age 25.7 years [range 18-39]). The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms, and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains (n= 26/29). Twelve patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Ten patients were positive among the 150 (48%) who were tested (RT-PCR and/or serology). Seven of 121 RT-PCR-tested patients were positive and 5 of 75 serology-tested patients were positive (IgG) among them RT-PCR and serology were both positive for two patients.

{"text": "COVID-19 Testing, Epidemic Features, Hospital Outcomes, and Household Prevalence, New York State-March 2020. BACKGROUND: The United States' COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter. We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations. METHOD(S): Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case's households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULT(S): During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case's households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those <5 years to 68% among those >=65 years (p<.0001). CONCLUSION(S): New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation. Background: Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. Method(s): In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. Finding(s): Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1.4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. Interpretation(s): Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

Background: Most of the countries are affected with the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus infection. Understanding the severity and distribution in various regions will help in planning the controlling measures. Objective(s): The objective was to assess the distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu, India. Method(s): The data on the number of infections of COVID-19 have been obtained from the media reports released by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020.

{"text": "A Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive: Can It Lead to Potential Reinfections?. Background COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been considered to provide protective immunity and its immunoassays have been widely used for serosurveillance. In our serosurveillance on an industrial workforce of randomly selected 3296 subjects, COVID-19 IgG antibody positivity was reported in 7.37% (243) subjects. However, when 30 days later, eight of the 243 COVID-19 IgG antibody-positive individuals complained of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and were confirmed as COVID-19 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), their COVID-19 IgG antibodies were retested. Seven of the eight previously IgG positive individuals had lost their protective antibodies. Methods Subsequently, a prospective clinical trial was planned by repeating the test for IgG antibodies on the remaining earlier positive 235 individuals at 45-65 days after their initial test. Only 201 of the 235 individuals consented and participated in the non-randomized single-arm observational trial. Results Only 28.36% (57/201) retained their IgG antibodies and 70.15% (141/201) had lost their IgG antibodies. Three cases reported equivocal results on retesting. Conclusions Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Further studies are needed with a quantitative assay over a period with neutralizing antibodies to establish if its decay can potentially lead to reinfections. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability.

{"text": "Comparison between five different assays to detect the levels of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapidly spread in the current pandemic. The diagnosis of Covid 19 is based on the detection of viral RNA by molecular amplification (NAAT) in nasopharingeal swabs and virus-specific antibodies of different isotypes in the serum. IgM and IgG anti-Sars CoV-2 appear 4-7 days after the onset of symptoms but the highest level of IgM and IgG are detected after 2-3 weeks and 3-6 weeks, respectively. Serological assays are useful for the diagnosis and for epidemiological studies. To compare different methods, we measured serum antibody levels with three automated assays including ElecsysRoche anti-SarsCov2, Abbott Sars-CoV-2 IgG and Diasorin LiasonSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG in a goup of 50 selected subjects (negative or positive for nasopharingeal swab, initial screening with Abbott serological test or previuos clinical suspect of COVID-19). A good concordance of the results (68%) was found between Roche and Diasorin assays, and between Roche and Abbott tests while the concordance between Abbott and Diasorin is lower (38%). The samples were also analyzed with other 2 non automated assays: Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) and Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgA).

{"text": "Low prevalence (0.13%) of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic pre-operative/pre-procedure patients at a large, academic medical center informs approaches to perioperative care. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reduced performance of elective surgeries and procedures at medical centers across the United States. Awareness of the prevalence of asymptomatic disease is critical for guiding safe approaches to operative/procedural services. As COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has been limited largely to symptomatic patients, health care workers, or to those in communal care centers, data regarding asymptomatic viral disease carriage are limited. Method(s): In this retrospective observational case series evaluating UCLA Health patients enrolled in pre-operative/pre-procedure protocol COVID-19 reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020, we determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients scheduled for surgeries and procedures. Result(s): Primary outcomes include the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in this asymptomatic population. Secondary data analysis includes overall population testing results and population demographics. Eighteen of 4,751 (0.38%) patients scheduled for upcoming surgeries and high-risk procedures had abnormal (positive/inconclusive) COVID-19 RT-PCR testing results. Six of 18 patients were confirmed asymptomatic and had positive test results. Four of 18 were confirmed asymptomtic and had inconclusive results. Eight of 18 had positive results in the setting of recent symptoms or known COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 0.13%. More than 90% of patients had residential addresses within a 67-mile geographic radius of our medical center, the median age was 58, and there was equal male/female distribution. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrating low levels (0.13% prevalence) of COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic population of patients undergoing scheduled surgeries/procedures in a large urban area have helped to inform perioperative protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department early in the pandemic. Method(s): Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Result(s): 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40 +/- 14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28 +/- 18 days), viral shedding (31 +/- 10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51), and work absence (29 +/- 28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response Higher IgG indexes were observed in individuals over 50 years of age (14.5 +/- 7.7 vs. 5.0 +/- 4.4, p = 0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalization, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly symptomatic (1/8) HCW. Conclusion(s): A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage.

BACKGROUND: Loss of smell and taste are commonly reported symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in people with acute loss of smell and/or taste is unknown. The study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a community-based population with acute loss of smell and/or taste and to compare the frequency of COVID-19 associated symptoms in participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19-related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD +/- 12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19-related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p < 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.27-6.36; p < 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that recent loss of smell is a highly specific COVID-19 symptom and should be considered more generally in guiding case isolation, testing, and treatment of COVID-19., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04377815.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We thus profiled the serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and specific memory B- and T-cell responses in convalescent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients., Methods: Altogether 119 samples from 88 convalescent donors who experienced mild to critical disease were tested for the presence of elevated anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibody levels over a period of eight months. In addition, level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, specific memory B- and T-cell responses were tested in a subset of samples., Findings: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 85% of the samples collected within 4 weeks after onset of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Levels of specific IgM/IgA antibodies declined after 1 month while levels of specific IgG antibodies and plasma neutralizing activities remained relatively stable up to 6 months after diagnosis. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were still present, though at a significantly lower level, in 80% of the samples collected at 6-8 months after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B- and T-cell responses developed with time and were persistent in all patients followed up till 6-8 months., Conclusions: Our data suggest that protective adaptive immunity following natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 might persist for at least 6-8 months, regardless of disease severity.

{"text": "UV, ozone, and COVID-19 transmission in Ontario, Canada using generalised linear models. Background: Quantifying the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 transmission is crucial in preventing more cases. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone (O3) have reported antimicrobial properties but few studies have examined associations with community infectivity of COVID-19. Research suggests UV light can be preventative while the effect of O3 is contested. We sought to determine the relationship between UV, O3, and COVID-19 incidence in Ontario, Canada. Method(s): In our time series analyses, we calculated daily incidence rates and reproductive number (Rt) from 34,975 cases between January and June 2020 across 34 Ontario Public Health Units. We used generalised linear models, adjusting for potential confounders, to calculate point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UV and O3. Analyses were further stratified by age groups and outbreaks at institutions versus community. Result(s): We found that 1-week averaged UV was significantly associated with a 13% decrease (95% CI: 0.80-0.96) in overall COVID-19 Rt, per unit increase. A negative association with UV was also significant among community outbreaks (PE: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) but not institutional outbreaks (PE: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.03). A positive association of O3 with COVID-19 incidence is strongly suggested among institutional outbreak cases (PE: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13). Conclusion(s): Our study found evidence to support the hypothesis that higher UV reduced transmission of COVID-19 and some evidence that ground-level O3 positively influenced COVID-19 transmission.

Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health.

In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there remain unanswered questions regarding the nature and significance of the humoral immune response toward other coronavirus infections. Here, we investigate the cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for their reactivity toward SARS-CoV-2. We extensively characterize a selection of 10 antibodies covering all of the SARS-CoV structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope. Although nearly all of the examined SARS-CoV antibodies display some level of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, we find only partial cross-neutralization for the spike antibodies. The implications of our work are two-fold. First, we establish a set of antibodies with known reactivity to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which will allow further study of both viruses. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the high propensity for antibody cross-reactivity between distinct strains of human coronaviruses, which is critical information for designing diagnostic and vaccine strategies for COVID-19. Bates et al. extensively examine the cross-reactivity of selected monoclonal antibodies raised against SARS-CoV structural proteins with SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND: We investigated patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the United States during May-July 2020., METHODS: We conducted case finding for patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 reinfection through the Emerging Infections Network. Cases reported were screened for laboratory and clinical findings of potential reinfection followed by requests for medical records and laboratory specimens. Available medical records were abstracted to characterize patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical course, and laboratory test results. Submitted specimens underwent further testing, including RT-PCR, viral culture, whole genome sequencing, subgenomic RNA PCR, and testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody., RESULTS: Among 73 potential reinfection patients with available records, 30 patients had recurrent COVID-19 symptoms explained by alternative diagnoses with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR, 24 patients remained asymptomatic after recovery but had recurrent or persistent RT-PCR, and 19 patients had recurrent COVID-19 symptoms with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR but no alternative diagnoses. These 19 patients had symptom recurrence a median of 57 days after initial symptom onset (interquartile range: 47 - 76). Six of these patients had paired specimens available for further testing, but none had laboratory findings confirming reinfections. Testing of an additional three patients with recurrent symptoms and alternative diagnoses also did not confirm reinfection., CONCLUSIONS: We did not confirm SARS-CoV-2 reinfection within 90 days of the initial infection based on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cases in this investigation.

The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions)., RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days., CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.

BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has impacted populations in many ways worldwide, including access to oral health services. This study aims to assess the association between lockdown due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT)., METHODS: We investigated GT online searches for toothache within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of the national lockdown in Iran. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to compare relative search volumes (RSVs) between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists' density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water using linear regression., RESULTS: When comparing 2020 with the previous four years, there was a rise of 2020 RSVs versus all previous years combined and each year (P < 0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B = - 3.29, 95% CI: (- 5.80, - 0.78), P = 0.012) had a strong negative relationship with provincial RSVs. HDI mostly had strong positive relationship with provincial RSVs in prior years. Fluoride concentration (B = - 0.13, 95% CI: (- 0.24, - 0.03), P = 0.017) and dentists' density (B = - 0.04, 95% CI: (- 0.25, 0.17), P = 0.669) were also negatively associated with RSVs in 2020.

Testing performed up to January 7, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. Healthcare workers were excluded. <h4>Main outcome measures</h4> The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection \u2265 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protective effectiveness of prior infection. <h4>Results</h4> Of 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 prior to August 30, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative. 974 (11%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 56 had possible reinfection. Of those, 26 (46.4 %) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 4,163 (12.9%) were subsequently positive and 2,460 of those (59.1%) were symptomatic. Protective effectiveness of prior infection was 78.5% (95% confidence interval 72.0 to 83.5), and against symptomatic infection was 83.1% (95% confidence interval 75.1 to 88.5). Protective effectiveness increased over time. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. Protective effectiveness increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is a limited resource around the world, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Patients were divided into COVID+ and COVID- based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or endotracheal aspirates. No COVID-19 specific interventions were given. The primary clinical outcome was death in the ICU within 3 months; secondary outcomes included in-hospital death and disease severity measures. Measurements including autoantibodies, were done longitudinally. ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used with alpha=0.05, with a false discovery rate of q=0.05. Bayesian analysis was performed to provide credible estimates of the possible states of nature compatible with our results. <h4>Results:</h4> 22 COVID+ and 20 COVID- patients were recruited, 69% males, median age 60.5 years. Overall, 64% had anti-nuclear antibodies, 38% had antigen-specific autoantibodies, 31% had myositis related autoantibodies, and 38% had high levels of anti-cytokine autoantibodies. There were no statistically significant differences between COVID+ and COVID- for any of the clinical or autoantibody parameters. A specific pattern of anti-nuclear antibodies was associated with worse clinical severity for both cohorts. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Severe COVID+ patients have similar humoral autoimmune features as comparably ill COVID- patients, suggesting that autoantibodies are a feature of critical illness regardless of COVID-19 status.

The extent of intranasal antiviral response in relation to symptoms is unknown. Understanding how local innate responses control virus is key in the development of therapeutic approaches.MethodsSARS-CoV-2-infected patients were enrolled in an observational study conducted at the Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland, investigating virological and immunological characteristics. Nasal-wash and serum specimens from a subset of patients were collected to measure viral load and a cytokine panel at different time points after infection; cytokine levels were analyzed in relation to symptoms.ResultsSamples from 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and six controls were analyzed. We found an increase in CXCL10 and IL-6, whose levels remained elevated for up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 infection also induced CCL2 and GM-CSF, suggesting local recruitment and activation of myeloid cells. Local cytokine levels correlated with viral load but not with serum cytokine levels, nor with specific symptoms, including anosmia.ConclusionsThe nasal epithelium is an active site of cytokine response against SARS-CoV-2 that can last more than 2 weeks; in this cohort, anosmia was not associated with increases in any locally produced cytokines.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Mapping of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Invasion and Histopathology in COVID-19 Disease. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) causes acute respiratory distress, termed COVID-19 disease, with substantial morbidity and mortality. As SCV2 is related to previously-studied coronaviruses that have been shown to have the capability for brain invasion, it seems likely that SCV2 may be able to do so as well. To date, although there have been many clinical and autopsy-based reports that describe a broad range of SCV2-associated neurological conditions, it is unclear what fraction of these have been due to direct CNS invasion versus indirect effects caused by systemic reactions to critical illness. Still critically lacking is a comprehensive tissue-based survey of the CNS presence and specific neuropathology of SCV2 in humans. We conducted an extensive neuroanatomical survey of RT-PCR-detected SCV2 in 16 brain regions from 20 subjects who died of COVID-19 disease. Targeted areas were those with cranial nerve nuclei, including the olfactory bulb, medullary dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the pontine trigeminal nerve nuclei, as well as areas possibly exposed to hematogenous entry, including the choroid plexus, leptomeninges, median eminence of the hypothalamus and area postrema of the medulla. Subjects ranged in age from 38 to 97 (mean 77) with 9 females and 11 males. Most subjects had typical age-related neuropathological findings. Two subjects had severe neuropathology, one with a large acute cerebral infarction and one with hemorrhagic encephalitis, that was unequivocally related to their COVID-19 disease while most of the 18 other subjects had non-specific histopathology including focal \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein white matter immunoreactivity and sparse perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing. Four subjects (20%) had SCV2 RNA in one or more brain regions including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, dorsal medulla and leptomeninges. The subject with encephalitis was SCV2-positive in a histopathologically-affected area, the entorhinal cortex, while the subject with the large acute cerebral infarct was SCV2-negative in all brain regions. Like other human coronaviruses, SCV2 can inflict acute neuropathology in susceptible patients. Much remains to be understood, including what viral and host factors influence SCV2 brain invasion and whether it is cleared from the brain subsequent to the acute illness.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Association Between Low Zinc Levels and Severity of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by New Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Background: We verify the prevalence of low zinc levels among critically ill patients infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the intensive care unit (ICU) who required invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as its association with severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Method(s): This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was <=100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 mug/dL. Result(s): A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly. The median BMI was 30.1 (24.7-32.1) kg/m2, with 59.9% (161 of 269) of patients having overweight and obesity. The prevalence of low zinc levels was 79.6% (214 of 269) and severe ARDS was 56.5% (152 of 269).

{"text": "Association of CXCR6 with COVID-19 severity: Delineating the host genetic factors in transcriptomic regulation. <h4>Background</h4> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that mainly affects the host respiratory system with \u223c80% asymptomatic or mild cases and \u223c5% severe cases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms. Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding its biological mechanisms. <h4>Methods</h4> We implemented integrative approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), colocalization analysis and functional element prediction analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. To understand the context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based single cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. <h4>Results</h4> We discovered and replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes have a protective effect on the lung and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis -expression quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells. In the lung resident memory CD8 + T (T RM ) cells, we found a 3.32-fold decrease of cell proportion and lower expression of CXCR6 in the severe than moderate patients using the BALF transcriptomic dataset. Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were highlighted in T RM cells trajectory from moderate to severe patients. <h4>Conclusions</h4> CXCR6 from the 3p21 . 31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower expression in lung T RM cells of severe patients, which aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis. We illustrate one potential mechanism of host genetic factor impacting the severity of COVID-19 through regulating the expression of CXCR6 and T RM cell proportion and stability.

Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent comorbidities identified in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Areas covered: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. Expert opinion: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory. Hyperglycemia may develop in patients with systemic corticosteroid treatment and should be managed upon accordingly.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, a number of cases and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have been reported worldwide. In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHOD(S): The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULT(S): From March 2020 to April 2020, 4 SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.Copyright \u00a9 2020, the Chinese Medical Association.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Implementation and evaluation of a COVID-19 rapid follow-up service for patients discharged from the emergency department. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid adaptation of healthcare providers to new clinical and logistical challenges. Following identification of high levels of emergency department (ED) reattendance among patients with suspected COVID-19 at our centre, we piloted a rapid remote follow-up service for this patient group. We present our service framework and evaluation of our pilot cohort of 192 patients. We followed up patients by telephone within 36 hours of their ED attendance. Pulse oximetry was used for remote monitoring of a subset of patients. Patients required between one and six consecutive telephone assessments, dependent on illness severity, and 23 patients were recalled for in-person assessment. Approximately half of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 required onward referral for respiratory follow-up. This framework reduced unplanned ED reattendances in comparison with a retrospective comparator cohort (4.7% from 22.6%). We reproduced these findings in a validation cohort with a high prevalence of acute COVID-19, managed through the clinic in September-October 2020, where we identified an unplanned ED reattendance rate of 5.2%. We propose that rapid remote follow-up is a mechanism by which ambulatory patients can be clinically supported during the acute phase of illness, with benefits both to patient care and to health service resilience.Copyright \u00a9 Royal College of Physicians 2021.

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, reports have demonstrated neurologic sequelae following COVID-19 recovery. Mechanisms to explain long-term neurological sequelae are un-known and need to be identified. Plasma from 24 individuals recovering from COVID-19 at 1 to 3 months after initial infection were collected for cytokine and antibody levels and neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicle (nEV) protein cargo analyses. Plasma cytokine IL-4 was increased in all COVID-19 participants. Volunteers with self-reported neurological problems (nCoV, n = 8) had a positive correlation of IL6 with age or severity of the sequalae, at least one co-morbidity and increased SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to those COVID-19 individuals without neurological issues (CoV, n = 16). Protein markers of neuronal dysfunction including amyloid beta, neurofilament light, neu-rogranin, total tau, and p-T181-tau were all significantly increased in the nEVs of all participants recovering from COVID-19 compared to historic controls. This study suggests ongoing peripheral and neuroinflammation after COVID-19 infection that may influence neurological sequelae by al-tering nEV proteins. Individuals recovering from COVID-19 may have occult neural damage while those with demonstrative neurological symptoms additionally had more severe infection. Longitudinal studies to monitor plasma biomarkers and nEV cargo are warranted to assess persistent neu-rodegeneration and systemic effects.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Aside from COVID-19, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.), and the first among Hispanic Americans. The Hispanic population is the largest minority group in the U.S., which is rapidly growing in size. Unfortunately, U.S. Hispanics and other minority groups experience many different health disparities, resulting in poor survival outcomes and a reduced quality of life. Factors such as genomic mutations, lower socioeconomic status, lack of education, reduced access to health care, comorbidities, and environmental factors all contribute to these health care inequalities. In the context of blood cancer health disparities, Hispanic patients are often diagnosed at a younger age and have worse outcomes compared with non-Hispanic individuals. In the present article, we highlight the existing knowledge about cancer health disparities in the Hispanic population, with a focus on chronic and acute leukemia. In our experience at the U.S./Mexico border, analysis of several different blood cancers demonstrated that younger Hispanic patients with acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia have higher incidence rates and worse prognoses. A combined approach, involving improved health care access and better knowledge of the underlying factors, will allow for more timely diagnoses and the development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating the disparities.

{"text": "Acceptance of a Symptom-Based Approach for COVID-19 rtRT-PCR Testing to Conserve Resources in a Lower Middle-Income Setting. SARS-CoV-2 initially emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. It has since been recognized as a pandemic and has led to great social and economic disruption globally. The Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtRT-PCR) has become the primary method for COVID-19 testing worldwide. The method requires a specialized laboratory set up. Long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretion after full clinical recovery of the patient is regularly observed nowadays. This forces the patients to spend a longer period in isolation and test repeatedly to obtain evidence of viral clearance. Repeated COVID-19 testing in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often leads to extra workload for laboratories that are already struggling with a high specimen turnover. Here, we present 5 purposively selected cases with different patterns of clinical presentations in which nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in patients for a long time. From these case studies, we emphasized the adoption of a symptom-based approach for discontinuing transmission-based precautions over a test-based strategy to reduce the time spent by asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation. A symptom-based approach will also help reduce laboratory burden for COVID-19 testing as well as conserve valuable resources and supplies utilized for rtRT-PCR testing in an emerging lower-middle-income setting. Most importantly, it will also make room for critically ill COVID-19 patients to visit or avail COVID-19 testing at their convenience.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Single-step, wash-free digital immunoassay for rapid quantitative analysis of serological antibody against SARS-CoV-2 by photonic resonator absorption microscopy. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses extraordinary threats and complex challenges to global public health. Quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer plays an important role in understanding the patient-to-patient variability of immune response, assessing the efficacy of vaccines, and identifying donors for blood transfusion therapy. There is an urgent and ever-increasing demand for serological COVID-19 antibody tests that are highly sensitive, quantitative, rapid, simple, minimally invasive, and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a single-step, wash-free immunoassay for rapid and highly sensitive quantitative analysis of serological human IgG against SARS-CoV-2 which requires only a single droplet of serum. By simply incubating 4 muL human serum samples with antibody-functionalized gold nanoparticles, a photonic crystal optical biosensor coated with the recombinant spike protein serves as a sensing platform for the formation of sandwich immunocomplex through specific antigen-antibody interactions, upon which the detected IgG molecules can be counted with digital precision. We demonstrated a single-step 15-min assay capable of detecting as low as 100 pg mL-1 human COVID-19 IgG in serum samples. The calculated limit of detecting (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) is 26.7 +/- 7.7 and 32.0 +/- 8.9 pg mL-1, respectively. This work represents the first utilization of the Activate Capture + Digital Counting (AC + DC)-based immunoassay for rapid and quantitative analysis of serological COVID-19 antibody, demonstrating a route toward point-of-care testing, using a portable detection instrument. On the basis of the sandwich immunoassay principle, the biosensing platform can be extended for the multiplexed detection of antigens, additional IgGs, cytokines, and other protein biomarkers.

{"text": "Stringent thresholds in SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays lead to under-detection of mild infections. BACKGROUND: Thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays have typically been determined using samples from symptomatic, often hospitalised, patients. In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear., METHODS: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds., RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6-92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9-82.7%)., CONCLUSION: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10-30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results. While lowered diagnostic thresholds may result in unacceptable specificity, our findings have implications for epidemiological analyses and result interpretation in individuals with a high pre-test probability. Samples from mild PCR-confirmed infections should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In the emergency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, great efforts were made to quickly provide serology testing to the medical community however, these methods have been introduced into clinical practice without the complete validation usually required by the regulatory organizations. SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n = 43) were analyzed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n = 50), confirmed respiratory infections (n = 50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n = 22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n = 30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen. EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2%-8.1% and 8.2%-9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was 100% (CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at >=14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%.

Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus\u2019s capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry.

{"text": "A Novel Soluble ACE2 Variant with Prolonged Duration of Action Neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Kidney Organoids. BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for approaches to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Administration of soluble ACE2 protein acting as a decoy to bind to SARS-CoV-2 should limit viral uptake mediated by binding to membrane-bound full-length ACE2, and further therapeutic benefit should result from ensuring enzymatic ACE2 activity to affected organs in patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): A short variant of human soluble ACE2 protein consisting of 618 amino acids (hACE2 1-618) was generated and fused with an albumin binding domain (ABD) using an artificial gene encoding ABDCon, with improved albumin binding affinity. Human kidney organoids were used for infectivity studies of SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility to examine the neutralizing effect of these novel ACE2 variants. RESULT(S): Whereas plasma ACE2 activity of the naked ACE2 1-618 and ACE2 1-740 lasted about 8 hours, the ACE2 1-618-ABD resulted in substantial activity at 96 hours, and it was still biologically active 3 days after injection. Human kidney organoids express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and when infected with SARS-CoV-2, our modified long-acting ACE2 variant neutralized infection. CONCLUSION(S): This novel ACE2 1-618-ABD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in human kidney organoids, and its prolonged duration of action should ensure improved efficacy to prevent viral escape and dosing convenience.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the American Society of Nephrology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The successful introduction of a hand dermatitis clinic to reduce occupational dermatoses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The physical action of handwashing (for a minimum of 20 s) disrupts the lipid barrier of the COVID-19 virus and thus hand hygiene is one of the most important preventative measures to reduce and ultimately stop the spread of it. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated prevalence of occupational dermatoses was 20% for clinical and 7% for nonclinical staff in a population of U.K. healthcare workers (HCWs). Studies during the pandemic have shown an increased prevalence of hand dermatitis (HD) where the risk rises with increasing numbers of episodes of handwashing suggesting a 'dose-response' effect. Studies of occupational HD during the pandemic have largely been survey-based, performed in a posthoc fashion. We established an in-person 'teach and treat' HD clinic for all staff, with two objectives: firstly, to treat occupational HD in a timely fashion, convenient to staff, enabling them to remain at work; secondly, to provide education regarding hand care and HD prevention. A proforma was developed to record the staff member's age, location of work, role and history of eczema. Brief targeted education regarding the regular application of emollient, and more intensive overnight treatment was designed. Two dermatologists staffed the clinic for 1 h, initially daily, reducing to three times a week as demand reduced in an appropriately sized clinical area within the hospital. Personal protective equipment was worn, and social distancing measures adhered to. The proforma was completed by the attendees and examination was performed by the clinician. A Physician Global Assessment score was assigned, followed by delivery of the brief educational intervention. Topical steroid was prescribed if required. In total, 532 staff attended from 26 March to 6 May 2020 (6-week period). The majority were women (81%; n = 432) with a median age of 42.5 years. The majority of staff were ward based (51%; n = 272). Intensive treatment unit and accident and emergency staff represented 15% (n = 82), theatre staff 5% (n = 28) and the remainder outpatient, office-based or other (laboratory, etc.). Nursing staff represented 33% (n = 177) of attendees, doctors 22% (n = 104) and allied health professionals 21% (n = 112). The remainder were porters, administrative staff, scientists and housekeeping. Thirtythree per cent (n = 178) of attendees reported a previous history of eczema. The prevalence of HD was 88% (n = 468), graded as mild in 52% (n = 276), moderate in 26% (n = 139) and severe/very severe in 9% (n = 50). Topical steroids of different potencies were required in 42% (n = 225) of staff: moderate in 49% (n = 111), potent in 44% (n = 100), highly potent in 1.8% (n = 4) and mild in 0.8% (n = 2). A subset of attendees was approached to evaluate the clinic. All (n = 10/10) were very satisfied with the service.

Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins.

{"text": "Antiviral activity of influenza A virus defective interfering particles against SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro through stimulation of innate immunity. SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in a devastating pandemic. Although the first approved vaccines were already administered by the end of 2020, vaccine availability is still limited. Moreover, immune escape variants of the virus are emerging against which the current vaccines may confer only limited protection. Further, existing antivirals and treatment options against COVID-19 only show limited efficacy. Influenza A virus (IAV) defective interfering particles (DIPs) were previously proposed not only for antiviral treatment of the influenza disease but also for pan-specific treatment of interferon (IFN)-sensitive respiratory virus infections. To investigate the applicability of IAV DIPs as an antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted in vitro co-infection experiments with produced, cell culture-derived DIPs and the IFN-sensitive SARS-CoV-2. We show that treatment with IAV DIPs leads to complete abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was dependent on janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. These results suggest an unspecific stimulation of the innate immunity by IAV DIPs as a major contributor in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, we propose IAV DIPs as an effective antiviral agent for treatment of COVID-19, and potentially also for suppressing the replication of new variants of SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Functional alterations caused by mutations reflect evolutionary trends of SARS-CoV-2. Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. Due to the limited virus strains, few key mutations that would be very important with the evolutionary trends of virus genome were observed in early studies. Here, we downloaded 1809 sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 strains from GISAID before April 2020 to identify mutations and functional alterations caused by these mutations. Totally, we identified 1017 nonsynonymous and 512 synonymous mutations with alignment to reference genome NC_045512, none of which were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. On average, each of the strains could have about 1.75 new mutations each month. The current mutations may have few impacts on antibodies. Although it shows the purifying selection in whole-genome, ORF3a, ORF8 and ORF10 were under positive selection. Only 36 mutations occurred in 1% and more virus strains were further analyzed to reveal linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants and dominant mutations. As a result, we observed five dominant mutations involving three nonsynonymous mutations C28144T, C14408T and A23403G and two synonymous mutations T8782C, and C3037T. These five mutations occurred in almost all strains in April 2020. Besides, we also observed two potential dominant nonsynonymous mutations C1059T and G25563T, which occurred in most of the strains in April 2020. Further functional analysis shows that these mutations decreased protein stability largely, which could lead to a significant reduction of virus virulence. In addition, the A23403G mutation increases the spike-ACE2 interaction and finally leads to the enhancement of its infectivity. All of these proved that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is toward the enhancement of infectivity and reduction of virulence. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 mutation 614G creates an elastase cleavage site enhancing its spread in high AAT-deficient regions. SARS-CoV-2 was first reported from China. Within three months, it evolved to 10 additional subtypes. Two evolved subtypes (A2 and A2a) carry a non-synonymous Spike protein mutation (D614G). We conducted phylodynamic analysis of over 70,000 SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses worldwide, sequenced until July2020, and found that the mutant subtype (614G) outcompeted the pre-existing type (614D), significantly faster in Europe and North-America than in East Asia. Bioinformatically and computationally, we identified a novel neutrophil elastase (ELANE) cleavage site introduced in the G-mutant, near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We hypothesised that elevation of neutrophil elastase level at the site of infection will enhance the activation of Spike protein thus facilitating host cell entry for 614G, but not the 614D, subtype. The level of neutrophil elastase in the lung is modulated by its inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT prevents lung tissue damage by elastase. However, many individuals exhibit genotype-dependent deficiency of AAT. AAT deficiency eases host-cell entry of the 614G virus, by retarding inhibition of neutrophil elastase and consequently enhancing activation of the Spike protein. AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less so in East Asia. Therefore, the 614G subtype is able to infect and spread more easily in populations of the former regions than in the latter region. Our analyses provide a molecular biological and evolutionary model for the higher observed virulence of the 614G subtype, in terms of causing higher morbidity in the host (higher infectivity and higher viral load), than the non-mutant 614D subtype.

{"text": "Olfactory and taste dysfunctions in COVID-19. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) can be a single and early prominent symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 infection unlike middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS. OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear., RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed the literature on OD and TD during the COVID-19 pandemic analyzing current data on pathogenesis and clinical correlates including prevalence, recovery rates, risk factors, and predictive power. Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic., SUMMARY: Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD. Recognizing inherent limitations of both subjective and objective OD and TD testing enables us better to manage chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, current mechanistic data suggest neurotropism of COVID-19 for olfactory neuro-epithelium and a potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Future studies are needed to explore further the neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A glimpse into the diverse cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific cellular immune response may prove to be essential for long-term immune protection against the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To assess COVID-19-specific immunity in the population, we synthesized selected peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as target antigens. Survey of the T cell precursur frequencies in healthy individuals specific to these viral antigens demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was further confirmed by in vitro induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses using dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture, which supported the corresponding T cell precursor frequencies in each of the individuals tested. In general, the combination of all five viral antigen pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, yet individual donors responded differently to different viral antigens. Importantly, in vitro restimulation of the T cells with the DC-peptides induced increased anti-viral immune responses in all individuals even in the no responders, suggesting that repeated antigen stimulation could elicit a broad protection in immune na\u00efve population. Our analysis recapitulates the critical role of cellular immunity in fighting COVID-19 and the importance of analyzing anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell response in addition to antibody response in the population. <h4>Importance</h4> Facing the rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants in the world, current emphasis on antibody-producing vaccines needs a quick revisit. The virus-specific cellular immunity may prove to be essential for long-term protection against COVID-19. This study designed a series of antigenic peptides encompassing the conserved and/or essential domains of Spike (S), Membrane (M), envelope (E), Nucleocapsid (N) and Protease (P) as targets to assess Covid-19-specific immunity in the population. The results demonstrated a diverse cellular immunity, including high, medium, low and no responders. This was verified by in vitro generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from these subjects. The study suggested that individuals responded differently to the different viral antigens, and importantly, repeated stimulation could produce virus specific T cells in all individuals, including the no responders. This study illustrates the needs for assessing anti-viral cellular immunity in addition to antibody response in the general population.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "NK Cell Subpopulations and Receptor Expression in Recovering SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Whereas in most cases COVID-19 is asymptomatic or pauci symptomatic, extremely severe clinical forms are observed. In this case complex immune dysregulations and an excessive inflammatory response are observed and are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Natural Killer cells are key players in the control of viral infection and their activity is regulated by a tight balance between activating and inhibitory receptors; an alteration of NK activity was suggested to be associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. In this study we analyzed peripheral NK cell subpopulations and the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in 30 in-patients suffering from chronic neurological conditions who recovered from mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing the results to those of 10 patients SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients. Results showed that an expansion of NK subset with lower cytolytic activity and an augmented expression of the 2DL1 inhibitory receptor, particularly when in association with the C2 ligand (KIR2DL1-C2), characterized the immunological scenario of severe COVID-19 infection; an increase of NK expressing the ILT2 inhibitory receptor was instead seen in patients recovering from mild or moderate infection compared to controls. Results herein suggest that the KIR2DL1-C2 NK inhibitory complex is a risk factor toward the development of severe form of COVID-19. Our results confirm that a complex alteration of NK activity is present in COVID-19 infection and offer a molecular explanation for this observation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Evidence from spatial analysis of New Orleans patient data at walk-up sites. <h4>Background: </h4> This paper evaluates the increase in coverage and use of Covid-19 testing services for vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations through the introduction of community-based walk-up sites in New Orleans, LA. While most GIS work on Covid-19 testing coverage and access has used census tract or ZIP code aggregated data, this manuscript is unique in that it uses individual level demographics and exact addresses to calculate distances actually traveled by patients. <h4>Methods: </h4> We used testing data recorded for 9,721 patients at 20 sites operating in May-June 2020. The dataset includes detailed age, race and ethnicity, and testing results as well as the exact address of each individual. Using GIS, we estimated changes in testing coverage for minority neighborhoods and calculated the actual distance covered by individuals. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were used to identify socio-demographic variables associated with distance travelled to and used of nearest testing site. We used a secondary dataset from drive-through sites to evaluate change in coverage at the census tract level for the metropolitan area. <h4>Results: </h4>: Walk-up sites significantly increased testing availability in New Orleans, and specifically in minority neighborhoods. Both African Americans and Asians were more likely (14.7% and 53.0%) to be tested at the nearest walk-up site. They also covered shorter distances to get tested. Being elderly was also significantly and positively associated with testing at the nearest site. Hispanics, however, were not associated with increased proximity to and use of nearest sites, and they traveled an additional 0.745 km to get tested. Individuals who tested positive also travelled significantly longer distances to obtain a test. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Walk-up sites increased testing availability for some vulnerable populations who took advantage of the sites\u2019 proximity, although inequalities appear at the metropolitan scale. As cities are planning community vaccination campaigns, mobile, walk-up sites appear to improve both coverage and accessibility for hard-to-reach populations. With adequate technical (vaccine dose refrigeration) and messaging (addressing reticence to immunization) adaptations, they could constitute a key complementary approach to health facility points of delivery.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Autonomic dysfunction in 'long COVID': rationale, physiology and management strategies. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented morbidity, mortality and global disruption. Following the initial surge of infections, focus shifted to managing the longer-term sequelae of illness in survivors. 'Post-acute COVID' (known colloquially as 'long COVID') is emerging as a prevalent syndrome. It encompasses a plethora of debilitating symptoms (including breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations and orthostatic intolerance) which can last for weeks or more following mild illness. We describe a series of individuals with symptoms of 'long COVID', and we posit that this condition may be related to a virus- or immune-mediated disruption of the autonomic nervous system resulting in orthostatic intolerance syndromes. We suggest that all physicians should be equipped to recognise such cases, appreciate the symptom burden and provide supportive management. We present our rationale for an underlying impaired autonomic physiology post-COVID-19 and suggest means of management.Copyright \u00a9 Royal College of Physicians 2021.

Ku et al. present a lentiviral vaccination vector that encodes a full-length, membrane-anchored form of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and induces neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. An intranasal boost strategy triggers a localized immune response in the upper respiratory tract that provides disease protection in mouse and hamster COVID-19 models., To develop a vaccine candidate against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we generated a lentiviral vector (LV) eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Systemic vaccination by this vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, confers only partial protection despite high levels of serum neutralizing activity. However, eliciting an immune response in the respiratory tract through an intranasal boost results in a >3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and reduces local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms display strong vaccine efficacy and inhibit lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and closely mirror human COVID-19 physiopathology.

TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma synergize to drive the cytokine storm and cell death associated with COVID-19 and sepsis., COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute lung damage associated with patient mortality. While multiple inflammatory cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that only the combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma induced inflammatory cell death characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. Mechanistically, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma protected mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock.

Background: Safe and effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to halt the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a promising inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoronaVac (developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China) is currently undergoing its clinical trials in several countries and showing good results. We investigated the immune mechanisms underlying CoronaVac from the perspective of single-cell gene expressions and immune function features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: In this controlled study, 13 healthy participants aged 21&ndash;54 years were recruited in the vaccination group and intramuscularly injected with two doses of CoronaVac (3 &mu;g / 0&middot;5 mL per dose, at Day00 and Day28, right after blood sampling), with peripheral blood samples collected at Day00, Day14, Day28, Day35, and Day45 to monitor dynamic changes. As positive control, 12 participants aged 28&ndash;75 years that had recovered from COVID-19 for approximately eight months were recruited in the recovery group with peripheral blood samples collected. Considering the high cost of sequencing, 11 samples from two healthy participants (H1 and H2) with four timepoints (Day00, Day14, Day28, and Day35) and three recovered participants (R1, R2, and R3) with one timepoint (Month8) were randomly chosen for single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The transcriptomics of PBMC and its constituent cells were analyzed as gene expression responses. For samples from all 25 participants, the serum neutralizing antibody titer to live SARS-CoV-2 and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytokine release activity of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells were assayed as immune function responses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the PBMC transcriptomics after vaccination resembled the COVID-19 recovery control more than that before vaccination, which also applied to its constituent cells such as B cells, T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells. Gradual transitions of PBMC transcriptomics were observed from Day14 to Day28 and Day35 in vaccination groups, which finally approached the recovery control. The B cell levels in PBMC increased after each vaccination, while the T cell levels mainly increased within four weeks after the first vaccination and peaked at Day28. The serum neutralizing antibody titer to live SARS-CoV-2 was low within four weeks after the first vaccination, but the second vaccination could induce significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers due to the immune memory. For both vaccinated participants and recovered participants, the upregulated JUN/FOS network and tuned expressions of immunoglobulin fragments such as IGHV3-30 and IGLV2-23 were observed in B cells. By purifying CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;T cells from PBMC and re-stimulating them with CoronaVac&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, five cytokines were significantly released, including Th1 cytokines (IFN-&gamma; and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10). Th1 cytokines were mainly activated at Day14, Day28, and Day35, supporting cellular immune responses at early stages when the serum neutralizing antibody titer was low. Th2 cytokines were mainly activated at Day28, Day35, and Day45, supporting humoral immune responses at later stages, especially after the second vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Two vaccinations of CoronaVac (3 &micro;g per dose, with an interval of 28 days) could make positive gene expression and immune responses in healthy participants, as revealed by single-cell PBMC transcriptomics and immune function assays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: China&rsquo;s National Science and Technology Major Projects for Major New Drugs Innovation and Development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: QG, YH, XM, and SZ are employees of Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China.

{"text": "Willingness to Adopt mHealth Among Chinese Parents During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study. BACKGROUND: Parental involvement in mobile health (mHealth) to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with the rapid development of the internet. More parents with busy jobs have chosen to use mHealth. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, mHealth can assist with health promotion, directions for medication use, and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of mHealth in parents' attitudes toward child health care at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt mHealth among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. METHOD(S): Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from January 25 to February 15, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of 16 items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes toward child health care at home. By multivariate logistic regression, we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. RESULT(S): A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents' duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; >6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing (chi26=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing (chi26=45.364, P<.001), frequency of leaving the home (chi26=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (chi26=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (chi26=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children (chi26=63.810, P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): We found various objective factors that were associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home. The option of mHealth to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health care at home.Copyright \u00a9Siyu Yang, Yijing Chen, Leshan Zhou, Yuting Huang, Jiahui Dai.

We sought to evaluate a remote monitoring system developed to manage pregnant or postpartum women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and to describe their disease course. Study Design: Pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in a remote symptom monitoring program. Postpartum women diagnosed through universal screening on delivery admission were also included. Women received automated twice-daily text messages to assess symptoms and were escalated to a Maternal Fetal Medicine provider for worsening dyspnea or a text of \"worse\" at any time (Figure 1). The managing provider evaluated the patient via telephone and triaged to continued outpatient surveillance or referral to the ED. Result(s): One hundred sixty women (113 Black, 36 White, 11 Other) were enrolled from March 23, 2020 to September 14, 2020. One hundred forty two were pregnant with a mean gestational age of 25w1d at enrollment. Eighteen women enrolled postpartum (14 asymptomatic). Of those enrolled, 93 tested positive, 47 negative, and 20 never underwent recommended testing. One hundred thirty women (81%) responded to at least one text each day, with 98 (61.3%) managed without escalation. Automated escalation occurred in 32(20%) women (75% Black), with 28 directed to continue self-monitoring at home and 4 directed to an ED.

We aim to investigate the immunological characteristics of monocytes in critical patients with COVID-19. Method(s): The number and immune status of monocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals. Result(s): In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16- monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16+ monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes. During the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the count and immune status of monocyte subsets were restored by degrees. HLA-DR+ monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation.

Het-nude mice have a thymus, but may have smaller thymic size and fewer bone marrow stem cells than do wildtype controls, suggesting that Het-nude mice might not be immunologically normal.This study compared the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of Het-nude and CD1-E SBS to murine norovirus (MNV)and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Het-nude and CD1-E female SBS (n = 22 mice of each stock) were housed continuously on soiled bedding collected from MNV-positive or MNV- and MHV-positive colonies at cage changes. Blood was collected for serology at 3, 9 and 12 to 19 wk after the start of soiled bedding exposure. Antibody titers to MNV or MHV did not differ significantly between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. A significant relationship was found between weeks of exposure and titer levels with an increase in titer over the testing period. This study supports the possible use of Het-nude mice as SBS, giventhat their antibody responses to MNV and MHV are equivalent to those of CD1-E mice.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Toward the understanding of national culture in the success of non-pharmaceutical technological interventions in mitigating COVID-19 pandemic. This study conceptually explores the relationship between a nation's culture and the success of utilizing various digital technologies to mitigate the spread of a pandemic, such as novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In the absence of a cure or vaccine of COVID-19, the national governments and public health authorities have been aggressively utilizing digital technologies to mitigate the pandemic spread. Given the urgency caused by COVID-19, this study highlights the importance of considering a country's national culture in evaluating the efficacy of a given digital technology, despite how promising or groundbreaking it may sound, in combating the spread of an infectious disease. Relying on the two critical dimensions of national culture, power distance and individualism/collectivism, this study proposes a framework that describes how people from different countries, depending on their prevalent national cultural values, would be receptive (or intolerant) to using government-run technology solutions meant for curbing the pandemic spread.

{"text": "Severity of liver test abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 depends on comorbidities and predicts early in-hospital mortality. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality., METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe., RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present., CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.

{"text": "Two pandemics of the 21st century: Covid-19 and swine flu of 2009. This brief analytical review is devoted to spreading, etiology, pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment of COVID-19 and \"swine flu\" causing pandemics in the 21st century. Both pandemics were caused by respiratory viruses belonging to different families, i.e., Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV-2) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus), respectively. In most cases, pathogens enter human organisms via epithelial cells of the upper airways. Sometimes, these viruses infect intestinal epithelium. Given that symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar, its diagnostics should always be based on laboratory results, especially, PCR evidence for specific RNA presence in clinical material. The paper describes similarities and differences in immune pathogenesis of the diseases. The main characteristics of two pandemic courses caused by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 are revealed. The presence of influenza vaccine and etiotropic chemotherapeutic agents, as well as preexisting immunity to influenza virus among elderly people in 2009 had a significant influence on morbidity and mortality during the influenza pandemic. The presence of antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in sera of elderly people before the pandemic can be explained by the fact that some antigenic properties of A(H1N1) virus which circulated before 1957 were similar to that of A/California/07/09 (H1N1)pdm09. Consequently, morbidity and mortality among people older than 65 (main risk group) were low, while children and young adults suffered more often. The opposite pattern is observed for COVID-19, since mortality among the elderly population is high, while the children and young adults have an asymptomatic or mild form of a disease. A suggestion is made that population in the South-East Asia may have immunity against SARS-CoV-2, since coronaviruses with antigenic features similar to the pandemic one could circulate in that region and infect population without evident symptoms, while one or several recent virus variants caused severe disease and COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Russian Association of Allergologists and Clinical Immunologists, St. Petersburg Regional Branch (SPb RAACI).

{"text": "COVID-19 after kidney transplantation: Early outcomes and renal function following antiviral treatment. Objectives: The lack of effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has mandated the repurposing of several drugs, including antiretrovirals and remdesivir (RDV). These compounds may induce acute kidney injury and are not recommended in patients with poor renal function, such as kidney transplant (KTx) recipients. Method(s): The records of 42 KTx recipients with COVID-19 were reviewed. Some of them were receiving antiretrovirals (n = 10) or RDV (n = 8) as part of COVID-19 management. Most patients were male (71%) and their median age was 52 years. The median glomerular filtration rate in these patients was 56 ml/min. Regarding disease severity, 36% had mild disease, 19% had moderate disease, 31% had severe disease, and 12% had critical disease. Subgroups, i.e., patients receiving antiretrovirals, RDV, or no antivirals, were comparable in terms of patient age, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. Result(s): Seven patients (16.6%) died during hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was found in 24% of KTx recipients at admission. Upon discharge, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increased in 32% and decreased in 39% of the KTx recipients compared with the admission rate. The decrease was more prevalent in the RDV group (80%) compared with KTx recipients without any antiviral treatment (29%) (p < 0.05). Most patients (62%) returned to baseline eGFR values within 1 month of discharge. The proportion was similar between the patients receiving antiviral treatment and those not receiving this treatment. Conclusion(s): KTx recipients run a high risk of COVID-19-related renal impairment. Antivirals appear to be safe for use without major risks for kidney injury.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The Neutralizing Antibody Response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and the Cytokine/Chemokine Release in Patients with Different Levels of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 Severity: Cytokine Storm Still Persists Despite Viral Disappearanc. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit a wide clinical spectrum ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to critical and fatal diseases, and older individuals are known to be more severely affected. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. A neutralizing antibody against viruses is known to be important to eliminate the virus. In addition, this antibody is induced at high levels in patients with severe COVID-19, followed by a termination of virus replication. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit high levels of cytokines/chemokines, even after the disappearance of the virus. This indicates that cytokines/chemokines play significant roles in disease severity. These findings also suggest that antiviral therapy (monoclonal antibody and/or convalescent plasma therapy) should be administered early to eliminate the virus, followed by steroid treatment after viral genome disappearance, especially in patients with severe symptoms.

We determined the prevalence of fever and cough in households. We evaluated household knowledge about COVID-19 prevention and adherence to preventive measures. We evaluated the presence of a workforce, essential infrastructure and equipment needed for COVID-19 case management, and the availability of essential maternal and child health services in health facilities. <h4>Setting</h4> Siaya in rural Western Kenya <h4>Participants</h4> households and health facilities in Siaya <h4>Results</h4> We visited 19\u2019474 households and assessed 152 facilities. The prevalences of fever and cough ranged from 1.4% to 4.3% and 0.2 to 0.8% respectively; 97% and 98% of households had not received a guest from nor travelled outside Siaya respectively; 97% knew about frequent handwashing, 66% knew about keeping distance, and 80% knew about wearing a mask; 63% washed their hands countless times; 53% remained home; and 74% used a mask when out in public. The health facility assessment showed: 93.6% were dispensaries and health centers; 90.4% had nurses; 40.5% had oxygen capacity; 13.5% had pulse oximeters; and 2 ventilators were available; 94.2% of facilities did not have COVID-19 testing kits; 94% and 91% of facilities continued to provide antenatal care and immunization services respectively. Health care worker training in COVID-19 had been planned. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Household prevalence of fever and cough was low suggesting Siaya had not entered the active community transmission phase in June 2020. Our assessment revealed a need for training in COVID-19 case management, and a need for basic equipment and supplies including pulse oximeters and oxygen. Future interventions should address these gaps. <h4>Strengths and limitations</h4> This study provides an example of how to successfully carry out an integrated rural health system baseline assessment of COVID-19 preparedness; an approach that would be useful for any country experiencing COVID-19 with a significant rural population.

{"text": "Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Confirmed and Negative Kawasaki Disease Patients During the Pandemic in Spain. Introduction: COVID-19 has a less severe course in children. In April 2020, some children presented with signs of multisystem inflammation with clinical signs overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD), most of them requiring admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This study aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of KD SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and negative patients during the pandemic in Spain. Material and Methods: Medical data of KD patients from January 1, 2018 until May 30, 2020 was collected from the KAWA-RACE study group. We compared the KD cases diagnosed during the COVID-19 period (March 1-May 30, 2020) that were either SARS-CoV-2 confirmed (CoV+) or negative (CoV-) to those from the same period during 2018 and 2019 (PreCoV). Results: One hundred and twenty-four cases were collected. There was a significant increase in cases and PICU admissions in 2020 (P-trend = 0.001 and 0.0004, respectively). CoV+ patients were significantly older (7.5 vs. 2.5 yr) and mainly non-Caucasian (64 vs. 29%), had incomplete KD presentation (73 vs. 32%), lower leucocyte (9.5 vs. 15.5 x 10(9)) and platelet count (174 vs. 423 x 10(9)/L), higher inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein 18.5vs. 10.9 mg/dl) and terminal segment of the natriuretic atrial peptide (4,766 vs. 505 pg/ml), less aneurysm development (3.8 vs. 11.1%), and more myocardial dysfunction (30.8 vs. 1.6%) than PreCoV patients. Respiratory symptoms were not increased during the COVID-19 period.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact populations around the globe. Information regarding the incidences and implications of arrhythmias in COVID-19 is limited., METHODS: A total of 463 patients with COVID-19 and who had at least one electrocardiogram recording from February 1 to March 19, 2020, in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the study., RESULTS: Arrhythmias occurred in 85 of 463 (18.4%) patients: atrial arrhythmias in 10.2%, junctional arrhythmias in 0.2%, ventricular arrhythmias in 3.5%, and conduction block in 7.3%. Compared with patients without arrhythmias, those with arrhythmias had higher mortality, both during the time from symptom onset (p < 0.001) and from admission to follow-up (p < 0.001). The frequencies of severe COVID-19 (44.7% vs. 21.2%; p < 0.001) and death (25.9% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.001) were higher in patients with arrhythmias than in those without arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias could predict severity and mortality, their odds ratios (OR) were 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.35 to 8.40), 5.80 (95% CI 1.89 to 17.76) respectively for severity, and were 3.51 (95% CI 1.74 to 7.08), 3.41 (95% CI 1.13 to 10.24) respectively for mortality. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias (all p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Arrhythmias were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.

{"text": "High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than two million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors., RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.

{"text": "Stroke epidemiology and COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the epidemiology, cause and clinical characteristics of incident stroke in different settings and populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have shown that there are three main themes in the epidemiology of stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic: COVID-19 seems to be associated with stroke in a significant number of patients. This association has been reported in several clinical series, mainly from China. There is a consistent trend towards a decreased number of hospital admissions of stroke patients during the pandemic. There are no population-based data available on incident stroke in individuals with COVID-19. SUMMARY: In this review, we report on increased rates and severe prognosis of ischemic stroke among individuals with COVID-19, probably explained by hypercoagulability and inflammation, documented since the early phase of disease.We confirm the presence of falling rates of new ischemic stroke admissions in hospitals, probably due to social consequences of the pandemic: fear to be infected or not adequately treated in the hospital. This phenomenon is restricted to mild stroke and transient ischemic attacks.Short and long-term consequences of this trend of new strokes in the pandemic need to be evaluated.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic affects the public overall psychological status including anxiety. Assessing the perceived risk and preventive behaviors and COVID-19-induced anxiety of every individual is crucial to be more effective in handling the outbreak., Purpose: This study intends to determine the status of perceived risk, preventive behavior, and induced anxiety regarding COVID-19 among urban residents in Ethiopia., Methods: In this research a population-based, cross-sectional design was employed among 801 urban residents in West Shewa Zone, Ethiopia from June to October 2020. COVID-19 Induced Anxiety Scale (CIAS) was used, with CIAS score >=80% taken as having anxiety. A Preventive Behavior towards COVID-19 Scale (PBCS) was used to measure the level of protective behavior. The data were gathered using CS Entry and analyzed with SPSS version 23.0. Basic descriptive analysis was conducted, and binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the predictors associated with anxiety., Results: Most of the study population, 716 (89.4%), had moderate risk perception, and around 497 (62.0%) of them had moderate preventive behavior against the pandemic. The proportion of COVID-19-induced anxiety disorder was found to be 18.1%. The identified predictors associated with COVID-induced anxiety were: being widowed (AOR=3.5; 95% CI: 1.7-7.6), lacking formal education (AOR=1.9; 95% CI: 1.3-3.3), having history of psychoactive substance use (AOR=3.0; 95% CI: 1.6-5.8), high protective behavior (AOR=2.2; 95% CI:1.5-3.3), low perceived risk (OR=3.7; 95% CI: 1.5-12.4), and family history of mental illness (AOR=1.6; 95% CI:0.7-3.8)., Conclusion and Recommendation: COVID-19-induced anxiety prevalence was 18.1%. Risk perception regarding COVID was moderate. However, only 38.0% of the population had high preventive behavior against the pandemic.

{"text": "Scoping Review of Existing Stroke Guidelines; Argument for a Value-Added Change. <h4>Background and Purpose</h4> Stroke represents one of the most important causes of morbidity ( eighty million patients with disabling of ongoing effects of stroke at a given time, globally) and mortality (the second leading cause of death) worldwide. Innovative systems biology-based approach is likely to increase the understanding of the underpinning of acute stroke promise to enhance stroke prevention, acute treatment, and neurorehabilitation. Recent growing body of evidence with shared pathobiology with COVID-19 and the critically important role of inflammation in the context of stroke points to far-reaching consequences of acute stroke, just as in the case of COVID-19 ( post-acute event issues as well as long term issues). So far, stroke typically defined by late-appearing disease manifestation by the range of stroke subtypes as defined by the WHO or American Stroke Association. This definition neglects the underlying pathobiological mechanisms such as low-grade chronic inflammation and already compromised vascular system. Diseases such as stroke is hardly a simple result of a single problem, but rather a complex cascade of pathobiological processes and interactions in a complex biochemical environment. The evidence of changes in innate immunity and adaptive immunity during the index event of acute stroke and recovery over next 3-12 months can be easily elicited with simple bedside blood tests such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with well over 300 published papers including several systematic reviews and meta-analyses confirming this. Global standard operating procedures (SOP) of stroke care dictated by the national and international stroke guidelines at present. It is imperative to explore the evidence of systems biology approach in current stroke guidelines. This is likely to be a key turning point in managing stroke across the continuum (prevention, management of acute event and rehabilitation). <h4>Methods</h4> We systematically searched for guideline recommendation on the day-to-day use of peripheral inflammatory markers such as NLR published in the English language between January 1, 2005, and December 2020. Any other evidence of systems biology-based approach or recommendation was explored within the selected guidelines for this scoping review. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 4 authors to determine clinical scenarios explained/given, scientific evidence used, and recommendations presented in the context of systems biology. <h4>Results</h4> The scoping review found 3,830 (3830) titles with 119 guidelines from 46 countries included for this review ( Figure 1; PRISMA diagram). Stroke-related organizations wrote Sixty-five per cent of the guidelines while national ministries wrote a fewer number of guidelines. We were primarily interested in recommendations for acute management in AIS published in the English language. Fifteen eligible guidelines were identified from 15 different countries/regions. None of the guidelines recommended the routine use of peripheral markers of inflammation, such as NLR, among their acute assessment and management recommendations. None of the existing guidelines explored the systems biology approach to one of the most complex diseases affecting the human brain, stroke. Figure 1 Acute Ischemic Stroke Guidelines Worldwide Figure 2: PRISMA Diagram <h4>Conclusions</h4> This systematic review has identified a significant evidence-practice gap in all existing national stroke guidelines published in English medium as of October 2020. These guidelines included the only current \u201cliving stroke guidelines, Stroke Guidelines from Australia with a real opportunity to modernize the living stroke guidelines with systems biology approach and provide 2020 vision towards better stroke care globally. Investigation of complex disease such as stroke is best served through a systems biology approach. One of the easiest places to start is simple blood tests such as total white cell count and NLR. Systems biology approach point us towards simple tools such immune-inflammatory index (SII), Sunshine Prognostic Score (SPS) which should pave the way for the stroke physician community address the challenges in systems biology approach in stroke care. These challenges include translating bench research to the bedside, managing big data ( continuous pulse, blood pressure, sleep, Oxygen saturation, progressive changes in NLR, SII, SPS, etc.). Working with an interdisciplinary team is also provide a distinct advantage.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Diarrhoea in adults with coronavirus disease-beyond incidence and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis. AIM: Diarrhoea is a relatively common manifestation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but there is no systematic review which comprehensively describes it beyond its incidence and impact on prognosis. This study aims to provide a detailed systematic review of diarrhoea in adults with COVID-19., METHODS: A PUBMED and Scopus search (until 7 September 2020) was performed. Studies that were limited to describing incidence of diarrhoea and its effect on prognosis were excluded., RESULTS: Twenty-six papers including 7860 patients with COVID-19 were subjected to synthesis. Mean duration of diarrhoea was 4.2 (3.6-4.9) days (range 1-16 days), whereas mean bowel movement count was 4.6 (3.8-5.3) and maximum was 20 per day. Diarrhoea started on an average 5.1 (3.8-6.5) days after disease onset but was the first manifestation in 4.3% patients. Stool occult blood was detected in 6.8% of patients with diarrhoea, while 53.3% cases had watery diarrhoea. Patients with diarrhoea also had elevated faecal calprotectin. Viral genome in faeces was detected more often in patients with diarrhoea and most often in patients without respiratory symptoms. Fever, myalgia and respiratory symptoms were observed with the same incidence in patients with and without diarrhoea. Similarly, there were no differences noted in complete blood count and most inflammation biomarkers between patients with and without diarrhoea. However, nausea, vomiting abdominal pain, sneezing and headache were more common in patients with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was the main manifestation of COVID-19 in 6.1% of cases and this form of the disease had specific features., CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhoea in COVID-19 needs further investigation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Pandemic: Demographic Predictors of Self-Isolation or Self-Quarantine and Impact of Isolation and Quarantine on Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression. Introduction: With the sudden onset and global dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many nations including Canada attempted to reduce spread of the resultant COVID-19 syndrome with self-isolation and quarantine, while seeking a cure or vaccine for this disease. Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. Methods: The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. Results: 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-hoc analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.

Uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 leads to severe phenotype development. <h4>Aim</h4> This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokines profile associated with severe human coronavirus diseases, including three stains: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2, in severe patients. <h4>Method</h4> PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 2020. Randomized and Observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers. <h4>Results</h4> A high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of the three strains of coronaviruses infection. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS. <h4>Conclusion</h4> This study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are similar to some extent. These findings highlight that nearly all studies reporting severe cases of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have been associated with elevated levels of IL-6, which could be used as a potential therapeutic target to improve patients\u2019 outcomes in severe cases.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 25/07/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared with therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised 24 studies and over 2,500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24, 0.39; I 2 94%], of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63; I 2 91%), of deep venous thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32; I 2 96%), and of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20; I 2 90%).

{"text": "Comparison of Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swab Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Detection of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective(s): To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Result(s): The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs..Copyright \u00a9 2021 American Medical Association.

Central to developing effective control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic is understanding the epidemiology of transmission in the community. Geospatial analysis of neighborhood-level data could provide insight into drivers of infection. In the current analysis of Harris County, Texas, we used custom interpolation tools in GIS to disaggregate COVID-19 incidence estimates from the zip code to census tract estimates-a better representation of neighborhood-level estimates. We assessed the associations between 29 neighborhood-level characteristics and COVID-19 incidence using a series of aspatial and spatial models. The variables that maintained significant and positive associations with COVID-19 incidence in our final aspatial model and later represented in a geographically weighted regression model were the percentage of the Black/African American population, percentage of the foreign-born population, area derivation index (ADI), percentage of households with no vehicle, and percentage of people over 65 years old inside each census tract. Conversely, we observed negative and significant association with the percentage employed in education. Notably, the spatial models indicated that the impact of ADI was homogeneous across the study area, but other risk factors varied by neighborhood.

Thus, this sudden health incident has brought great risk and pressure to the city with dense population flow. A deep understanding of the migration characteristics and laws of the urban population in China will play a very positive role in the prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Based on Baidu location-based service (LBS) big data, using complex networks method and geographic visualization tools, this paper explores the spatial structure evolution of population flow network (PFN) in 368 cities of China under different traffic control situations. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze how the population flow across cities affects the spread of the epidemic. Our findings show that: (1) the scope of population flow is closely related to the administrative level of the city and the traffic control policies in various cities which adjust with the epidemic situation; The PFN mainly presents the hierarchical structure dominated by the urban hierarchy and the regional isolation structure adjacent to the geographical location.(2) through the analysis network topology structure of PFN, it is found that only the first stage has a large clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length, which conforms to the characteristics of small world network. The epidemic situation has a great impact on the network topology in other stages, and the network structure tends to be centralized. (3) The overall migration scale of the whole country decreased by 36.85% compared with the same period of last year's lunar calendar, and a further reduction of 78.52% in the nationwide traffic control stage after the festival.

Medicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg. While, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals. Patients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast. Patients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments. RT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study. Chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day 7 of the study., RESULTS: By day 3, 71.1 % and 50.0 % patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively.

Which concept of disease one assumes has implications for what conditions count as diseases and, by extension, who may be regarded as having a disease (disease judgements) and for who may be accorded the social privileges and personal responsibilities associated with being sick (sickness judgements). In this article, we consider an ideal diagnostic test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection with respect to four groups of people-positive and asymptomatic; positive and symptomatic; negative; and untested-and show how different concepts of disease impact on the disease and sickness judgements for these groups. The suggestion is that sickness judgements and social measures akin to those experienced during the current COVID-19 outbreak presuppose a concept of disease containing social (risk of) harm as a component. We indicate the problems that arise when adopting this kind of disease concept beyond a state of emergency.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The dynamic change of antibody index against Covid-19 is a powerful diagnostic tool for the early phase of the infection and salvage PCR assay errors. BACKGROUND: Currently, PCR assay is a golden standard for diagnosis of Covid-19. However, it needs nasopharyngeal swabs, expensive instruments and expertise. It even causes PCR errors., METHODS: We validated the antibody assay (Roche) in 36 followed patients and 1879 controls (medical staffs)., RESULTS: Of 1879 medical staffs, only two (0.11%) were positive by Cut off Index (COI; 1.0) (mean +/- SD, 0.094 +/- 0.047). Thirty six patients were composed of three groups; Group A,4 from Diamond Princess cruise ship, Group B, 2 infected in Africa, and Group C, 30 infected in Japan. PCR assays were conducted at outside laboratories before and repeated in house after hospitalized. Of 36 at admission, positive antibody was seen in 4/4 from the ship, 0/2 from Africa, and 5/30 from Japan. Two from Africa showed the increase of COI and became positive on days 8 and 13. Thirty Japanese was divided in two groups, e.g., 23 showed dynamic increase of COI up to 84.4 within 3 days while active virus replication present (Group C). In remaining 7 (7/30, 23%) (Group C'), no rise of antibody nor positive in house PCR assays, indicative of false positive results of PCR at the beginning., CONCLUSION: This antibody testing has a wide dynamic ranges of COI and, thus, could be utilized in the early infection phase. This may also compliment and even help to avoid possible PCR errors. Therefore, this can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool, needed in the frontline of the clinic and hospitals.

{"text": "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in an Adolescent Nigerian Girl with COVID-19: A call for vigilance in Africa. Most reports of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) have come from Europe and North America. The paucity of reports in Africa is in contrast with the demographics of the series in New York, Paris and UK with children of African ancestry accounting for over 40%, of all cases of MIS-C. With the global trend of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry, enhanced surveillance and awareness for this syndrome in children with COVID-19 in Africa are therefore important. A case report of a 12-year old Nigerian girl with MIS-C is presented in line with the WHO global surveillance especially in areas were MIS-C is considered a rarity. This case report stimulates a call for vigilance and expanded effort at surveillance to promote early recognition and diagnosis of MIS-C in Nigeria and Africa. The favourable outcome and experience from this case will create awareness, expand knowledge, and support clinicians in Nigeria and the African continent in their approach to other potential cases.

{"text": "Internet of medical things (IoMT)-integrated biosensors for point-of-care testing of infectious diseases. On global scale, the current situation of pandemic is symptomatic of increased incidences of contagious diseases caused by pathogens. The faster spread of these diseases, in a moderately short timeframe, is threatening the overall population wellbeing and conceivably the economy. The inadequacy of conventional diagnostic tools in terms of time consuming and complex laboratory-based diagnosis process is a major challenge to medical care. In present era, the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) is in demand for fast detection of infectious diseases along with \"on-site\" results that are helpful in timely and early action for better treatment. In addition, POCT devices also play a crucial role in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases by offering real-time testing and lab quality microbial diagnosis within minutes. Timely diagnosis and further treatment optimization facilitate the containment of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Presently, efforts are being made to support such POCT by the technological development in the field of internet of medical things (IoMT). The IoMT offers wireless-based operation and connectivity of POCT devices with health expert and medical centre. In this review, the recently developed POC diagnostics integrated or future possibilities of integration with IoMT are discussed with focus on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, influenza A (H1N1), human papilloma virus (HPV), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronavirus (COVID-19). The IoMT-assisted POCT systems are capable enough to fill the gap between bioinformatics generation, big rapid analytics, and clinical validation. An optimized IoMT-assisted POCT will be useful in understanding the diseases progression, treatment decision, and evaluation of efficacy of prescribed therapy. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

At a time when COVID-19 immunity certificates are debated and vaccination certificates might potentially be made available if an effective vaccine is established, we conducted a study to elucidate public opinion on this issue. Our objective was to determine social and individual perceptions of COVID-19 immunity certificates through a population-based study. A nested survey within the SEROCoV-POP study, a population-based serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland, was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was proposed to 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants. Measures included percentage of participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements on immunity and vaccination certificates. Stratification by age, gender, education and work status was used to examine socio-demographic variations. Of the 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants, 1425 completed the questionnaire (response rate 93%; mean age +/- standard deviation 52 +/- 15.1 years; 51.9% women). About 80% of participants agreed that knowing one's serology status would lead to a change in one's behaviour. In the event that the presence of antibodies correlated with immunity, 60% of participants reported that certificates should be offered to the general population. The results showed variations in perceptions of certificates depending on the context (73% agreed on certificates' utility for travel, 72% for entering a country, and 32% for the right to work). Provided an effective vaccine was available, 55% of participants agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and 49% agreed that a vaccination certificate should be mandatory. About 68% reported a potential risk of discrimination and 28% a risk of deliberate infection. Differences were seen with age, gender and education level. This study shows that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland can envisage scenarios where COVID-19 immunity, and eventually vaccination, certificates would be useful. Seroprevalence estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain low to date, and the interpretability of serological testing and immunity remains undefined. However, the information from this study is important, especially the differences based on context and the socio-demographic variations, and should be taken into account if COVID-19-related certificates are to be implemented.Copyright \u00a9 2020 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

{"text": "Mean platelet volume/platelet count ratio predicts severe pneumonia of COVID-19. Background: Although platelet mean volume/platelet count ratio (MPR) is considered to be a crucial marker of inflammatory and infectious diseases, the relationship between MPR and novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 85 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into low and high MPR group. Data from repeated measures were compared by the generalized estimating equations. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of MPR on the incidence of severe pneumonia (SP), with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) used to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome is the incidence of SP of COVID-19. Result(s): During follow-up, 17 (20.0%) patients were developed to SP. Compared with mild patients, patients with SP developed showed a higher MPR level at baseline, day 1, day 2, and day 3 after admission (P =.005, P =.015, P =.009, and P =.032, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method showed a higher incidence of SP in the high MPR group than the low MPR group (log-rank test = 10.66, P =.001). After adjustment, high MPR was associated with an elevated incidence of SP (HR, 5.841, 95% CI, 1.566-21.791, P =.009). The IPTW method also suggested that MPR was a significant factor related to the incidence of SP (HR, 8.337, 95% CI, 4.045-17.182, P <.001).

{"text": "Burnout and secondary traumatic stress in health-system pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: To describe the prevalence of burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in health-system pharmacists during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods . A cross-sectional, professional pharmacy organization listserver-based online survey of a target group of health-system pharmacists across the United States was conducted. The survey was sent out through professional organization listservers and was anonymous and voluntary. The survey questionnaire included items regarding demographics and employment characteristics, COVID-19-related questions, a survey of respondents' perceptions of the prevalence and severity of burnout, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS., RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents' self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents' self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction., CONCLUSION: The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial.

{"text": "Vertebral fractures in children during the covid-19 pandemic. Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on the main epidemiological indicators of emergency trauma, as well as on the pediatric population. Aim. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of compression fractures of vertebral bodies in children between January and July 2020 (the first months of COVID-19 pandemic). Materials and methods. A comprehensive examination and treatment of 82 children and adolescents aged 3-17 years, who received compression fractures of the vertebral bodies in the period from January 1 to July 31, 2020, was carried out. A group of 96 children of the same age who sustained a similar type of injury at the same time in 2019 was studied as a control. To make a clinical diagnosis, we used methods of traditional research examination for emergency traumatology. The severity of vertebrogenic fractures was determined according to the AO/ASIF classification. Results. The total number of patients diagnosed with vertebral fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.58% less than that in the same period in 2019. Patients in the comparison groups were comparable in sex, average age of injury, and age group in which the spine was most often injured. The most frequent mechanism of spinal injuries in patients of the comparison groups was a fall from a height. More often than others, ThVI and ThVII vertebral bodies were broken. The severity of vertebral fractures in all cases corresponded to type A, subtypes A1 and A2. For treatment, conservative methods were used in most cases. During the period of strict self-isolation, in April 2020, no children of the main group had vertebral fracture because they were forbidden to leave their apartments unnecessarily. In May 2020, the number of children with vertebral fractures was half the number in the same month in 2019. In June 2020, the incidence of vertebral fractures was in line with the pre-crisis average. Conclusion. Strictly following restrictive anti-epidemic measures during a pandemic is an effective method of reducing the number of cases requiring emergency treatment for compression fractures of the vertebral bodies in children.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Eco-Vector LLC.

Of eligible members, 91 212 (2.6%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 3686 had positive results (overall incidence, 105.9 per 100 000 persons; by racial group, White, 55.1; African American, 123.1; Hispanic, 219.6; Asian, 111.7; other/unknown, 79.3). African American persons had the highest unadjusted testing and mortality rates, White persons had the lowest testing rates, and those with other or unknown race had the lowest mortality rates. Compared with White persons, adjusted testing rates among non-White persons were marginally higher, but infection rates were significantly higher; adjusted odds ratios [aORs] for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.31), 3.93 (CI, 3.59 to 4.30), 2.19 (CI, 1.98 to 2.42), and 1.57 (CI, 1.38 to 1.78), respectively. Geographic analyses showed that infections clustered in areas with higher proportions of non-White persons. Compared with White persons, adjusted hospitalization rates for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 1.47 (CI, 1.03 to 2.09), 1.42 (CI, 1.11 to 1.82), 1.47 (CI, 1.13 to 1.92), and 1.03 (CI, 0.72 to 1.46), respectively. Adjusted analyses showed no racial differences in inpatient mortality or total mortality during the study period.

{"text": "The SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other SARS-related CoVs encode 3 tandem macrodomains within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Mac1 domains exhibit similar structural folds, and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with affinities in the low micromolar range. Importantly, using ADP-ribose-detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate than the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused more than 1.2 million deaths worldwide. With no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic posttranslational process that is increasingly being recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Alhammad et al.

Background: Understanding mid-term kinetics of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is the cornerstone for public health control of the pandemic and vaccine development.

Neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. IgG antibody titer was evaluated by ELISA against the S2 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (NP). Statistical analyses were carried out using mixed-effects models., Findings: We found that individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay in neutralizing activity, which persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis. Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained higher among hospitalized individuals compared to mild symptomatic. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of anti-RBD, S2 or NP antibody titers, all of them showing a constant decline over the follow-up period., Conclusions: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the quality of the neutralizing immune response against SARS-CoV-2 evolves over the post-convalescent stage., Funding: This study was funded by Grifols, CERCA Programme and Departament de Salut (Generalitat de Catalunya), Spanish Health Institute Carlos III, and the crowdfunding initiatives #joemcorono, BonPreu/Esclat and Correos.

{"text": "Interplay of Antibody and Cytokine Production Reveals CXCL13 as a Potential Novel Biomarker of Lethal SARS-CoV-2 Infection. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is impacting the global population. This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to receptor binding domain (RBD), nucleocapsid, and spike S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 develop over the first 10 to 20days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2+ patient specimens, 86%), suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were different based on patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age. Analyses of these findings may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the levels of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients throughout infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2+ patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-18, and gamma interferon [IFN-gamma]) and chemotactic markers (IP-10 and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), GRO-alpha, and MIP-1alpha relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients who succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Furthermore, patients who succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and had a higher ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population, and knowledge of the immune response to COVID-19 is still developing. This study assesses the interplay of different parts of the immune system during COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate that COVID-19 patients produce antibodies to three proteins of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and identify many other immunological proteins that are involved during infection. The data suggest that one of these proteins (CXCL13) may be a novel biomarker for severe COVID-19 that can be readily measured in blood.

The top 3 neutralizing Abs (13G9, 58G6 and 510A5) exhibited comparative ultrapotency as those being actively pursued for clinical development. Interestingly, the antigenic sites for the majority of our neutralizing Abs overlapped with a single epitope (13G9e) on S-RBD. Further, the 3-dimensional structures of 2 ultrapotent neutralizing Abs 13G9 or 58G6 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S trimer demonstrated that both Abs bound to a steric region within S 472\u2013490 . Moreover, a specific linear region (S 450\u2013457 ) was identified as an additional target for 58G6. Importantly, our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed a unique phenomenon that the S-RBDs interacting with the fragments of antigen binding (Fabs) of 13G9 or 58G6 encoded by the IGHV1-58 and the IGKV3-20 gene segments were universally in the \u2018up\u2019 conformation in all observed particles.

{"text": "Mental Illness, Mass Shootings, and the Future of Psychiatric Research into American Gun Violence. ABSTRACT: This article outlines a four-part strategy for future research in mental health and complementary disciplines that will broaden understanding of mass shootings and multi-victim gun homicides. First, researchers must abandon the starting assumption that acts of mass violence are driven primarily by diagnosable psychopathology in isolated \"lone wolf\" individuals. The destructive motivations must be situated, instead, within larger social structures and cultural scripts. Second, mental health professionals and scholars must carefully scrutinize any apparent correlation of violence with mental illness for evidence of racial bias in the official systems that define, measure, and record psychiatric diagnoses, as well as those that enforce laws and impose criminal justice sanctions. Third, to better understand the role of firearm access in the occurrence and lethality of mass shootings, research should be guided by an overarching framework that incorporates social, cultural, legal, and political, but also psychological, aspects of private gun ownership in the United States. Fourth, effective policies and interventions to reduce the incidence of mass shootings over time-and to prevent serious acts of violence more generally-will require an expanded body of well-funded interdisciplinary research that is informed and implemented through the sustained engagement of researchers with affected communities and other stakeholders in gun violence prevention. Emerging evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has produced a sharp increase both in civilian gun sales and in the social and psychological determinants of injurious behavior adds special urgency to this agenda.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019: investigational therapies in the prevention and treatment of hyperinflammation. Introduction: The mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently driven by an injurious immune response characterized by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), endotheliitis, coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. This spectrum of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 is commonly referred to as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Areas covered: Medline and Google Scholar were searched up until 15th of August 2020 for relevant literature. Evidence supports a role of dysregulated immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19. CSS associated with SARS-CoV-2 shows similarities to the exuberant cytokine production in some patients with viral infection (e.g.SARS-CoV-1) and may be confused with other syndromes of hyperinflammation like the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in CAR-T cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have emerged as predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Expert opinion: Despite similarities, COVID-19-CSS appears to be distinct from HLH, MAS, and CRS, and the application of HLH diagnostic scores and criteria to COVID-19 is not supported by emerging data. While immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids has shown a mortality benefit, cytokine inhibitors may hold promise as 'rescue therapies' in severe COVID-19. Given the arguably limited benefit in advanced disease, strategies to prevent the development of COVID-19-CSS are needed.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Emerging evidence hints in favor of a life-threatening link between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 may result in dramatic cardiovascular complications, whereas the severity of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the incidence of fatalities tend to increase in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular complications. SARS-CoV-2 is internalized into the host cells by endocytosis and may then escape the endolysosomal system via endosomes.

{"text": "Reaction of Human Monoclonal Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Proteins With Tissue Antigens: Implications for Autoimmune Diseases. We sought to determine whether immune reactivity occurs between anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein antibodies and human tissue antigens, and whether molecular mimicry between COVID-19 viral proteins and human tissues could be the cause. We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Vojdani, Vojdani and Kharrazian.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The Relationship Between Social Vulnerability and COVID-19 Incidence Among Louisiana Census Tracts. Objective: To examine the association between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and COVID-19 incidence among Louisiana census tracts. Methods: An ecological study comparing the CDC SVI and census tract-level COVID-19 case counts was conducted. Choropleth maps were used to identify census tracts with high levels of both social vulnerability and COVID-19 incidence. Negative binomial regression with random intercepts was used to compare the relationship between overall CDC SVI percentile and its four sub-themes and COVID-19 incidence, adjusting for population density. Results: In a crude stratified analysis, all four CDC SVI sub-themes were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. Census tracts with higher levels of social vulnerability were associated with higher COVID-19 incidence after adjusting for population density (adjusted RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.41-1.65). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that increased social vulnerability is linked with COVID-19 incidence. Additional resources should be allocated to areas of increased social disadvantage to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations.

{"text": "Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after 152 days: A case report. Background: In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected. We are still learning more about COVID-19. Ongoing COVID-19 studies will help us to understand.The degree of protective immunity conferred by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently unknown. As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. Here we describe presentation and investigations of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual. Methodology: A 38-year-old man who is a resident of Dhaka city, Engineer by profession presented to doctors on two occasions with symptoms of viral infection. First time at a community testing event in June, 2020, and a second time to Evercare hospital at the mid November, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation and twice during follow-up. RT PCR testing was done to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. CXR P/A view was performed in 1st time of Covid infection & HRCT of chest was performed during his stay at Evercare hospitals Findings: The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on June 20th, 2020, and the second on November 18th 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in July, 2020. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first with remarkable radiological changes of Chest in high resolution CT scanning. Interpretation(s): Two subsequent negative RT PCR after 1st positive with clinically asymptomatic period after 2 weeks of mild symptoms was observed in our patient. About 5 months later he was Covid19 positive again with moderate symptoms. These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV2 on two separate occasions probably by genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Mamun SMA.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Viral Infection and Cardiovascular Disease: Implications for the Molecular Basis of COVID-19 Pathogenesis. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While this respiratory virus only causes mild symptoms in younger healthy individuals, elderly people and those with cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension are susceptible to developing severe conditions that can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of this virus on the cardiovascular system should thus help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since this virus causes severe and fatal conditions in older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities, effective therapies targeting specific populations will likely contribute to ending this pandemic. In this review article, the effects of various viruses-including other coronaviruses, influenza, dengue, and human immunodeficiency virus-on the cardiovascular system are described to help provide molecular mechanisms of pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The goal is to provide mechanistic information from the biology of other viral infections in relation to cardiovascular pathologies for the purpose of developing improved vaccines and therapeutic agents effective in preventing and/or treating the acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "More Than Just Gene Therapy Vectors: Lentiviral Vector Pseudotypes for Serological Investigation. Serological assays detecting neutralising antibodies are important for determining the immune responses following infection or vaccination and are also often considered a correlate of protection. The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis.

{"text": "Rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease and its effect on multiple systems is growing. Kidney injury has been a topic of focus, and rhabdomyolysis is suspected to be one of the contributing mechanisms. However, information on rhabdomyolysis in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. We aim to describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed rhabdomyolysis. Materials and methods A retrospective observational cohort consisted of patients who were admitted and had an outcome between March 16 to May 27, 2020, inclusive of those dates at a single center in the Bronx, New York City. All consecutive inpatients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Patients with peak total creatine kinase (CK) over 1,000 U/L were reviewed; 140 patients were included in the study. The main outcomes during hospitalization were new-onset renal replacement therapy and in-hospital mortality. Results The median age was 68 years (range: 21-93); 64% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (73%), diabetes mellitus (47%), and chronic kidney disease (24%). Median CK on admission was 1,323 U/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 775 - 2,848). Median CK on discharge among survivors was 852 (IQR: 170 - 1,788). Median creatinine on admission was 1.78 mg/dL (IQR: 1.23 - 3.06). During hospitalization, 49 patients (35%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 patients (17.1%) were treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 66 (47.1%) died. Conclusions Rhabdomyolysis was a common finding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our hospital in the Bronx. The incidence of new-onset renal replacement therapy and in-hospital mortality is higher in patients who develop rhabdomyolysis. McMahon score, rather than isolated creatine kinase levels, was a statistically significant predictor of new-onset RRT. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 patients throughout their admission and use validated scores like McMahon score to devise their treatment plan accordingly.

{"text": "Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-\u03b2 in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-\u03b2 (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patient\u2019s plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-\u03baB pathway, we examined the status of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Importance</h4> Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We determined that the E802D mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was sufficient to confer decreased RDV sensitivity without affecting viral fitness. Analysis of more than 200,000 sequences of globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants show no evidence of widespread transmission of RDV-resistant mutants.

INTRODUCTION: On March 11, 2020 the WHO announced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Lockdown restrictions, compromised access to medical care and fear of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have forced patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) to stay home. Thissituation can lead to delay in T1D diagnosis and insulin treatmentresultingin rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and therefore increased risk of complications and death.., AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of DKA at the onset of T1D in children diagnosed in our department during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 till May 2020 in comparison to corresponding period of the previous year.., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected data ofchildren with newly diagnosed T1D.

{"text": "The temporary ban on tobacco sales in South Africa: lessons for endgame strategies. BACKGROUND: The endgame literature recommends that, for a tobacco sales ban to be successful, several demand-side preconditions (eg, low prevalence and effective cessation support) should be in place. The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning. METHOD(S): Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban. RESULT(S): About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels. CONCLUSION(S): The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.Copyright \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, China, causing outbreaks of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 that has now spread globally. For this reason, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency in March 2020. People living with pre-existing conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and chronic kidney and lung diseases, are prone to develop severe forms of disease with fatal outcomes. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and T2D alter the balance of innate and adaptive responses. Both diseases share common features characterized by augmented adiposity associated with a chronic systemic low-grade inflammation, senescence, immunoglobulin glycation, and abnormalities in the number and function of adaptive immune cells. In obese and T2D patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, where immune cells are already hampered, this response appears to be stronger.

{"text": "Estimating the infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during the spring 2020 pandemic wave: a model-based analysis. Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. Method(s): In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and >=75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). Finding(s): During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205 639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21 447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 1.39% (95% credible interval 1.04-1.77) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and >=75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0.116% (0.0729-0.148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0.939% (0.729-1.19) for those aged 45-64 years versus 4.87% (3.37-6.89) for those aged 65-74 years and 14.2% (10.2-18.1) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 6.72% (5.52-8.01) for those aged 65-74 years and 19.1% (14.7-21.9) for those aged 75 years and older. Interpretation(s): Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere.

Lockdown restrictions halved the new cases. No significant differences in the likelihood of being SARS-CoV-2 positive for different job categories were detected during lockdown. The presence of respiratory symptoms was an independent predictor for rapid antigen test positivity; however, one-third of newly diagnosed patients were asymptomatic at both time points., CONCLUSIONS: The catering/food sector was the most vulnerable to COVID-19 at the pre-lockdown evaluation. We highlight the crucial role of community-based screening with rapid antigen testing to evaluate the potential modes of community transmission and the impact of infection control strategies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background To date, several pharmacological agents have been employed in the treatment and management of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the utility of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 infection is now widely touted, their efficacy in thwarting the progression of non-severe disease remains elusive. Methods A retrospective cohort study involving 25 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of non-severe COVID-19 infection was conducted. Subjects were assigned to either the steroid or the non-steroid group. A low-dose, short-course corticosteroid regimen was administered for seven days and the disease outcomes were recorded and compared among the two groups. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to discern the data normality. Results In patients treated with low-dose, short-course steroids, the overall all-cause mortality was significantly lower compared with the non-steroid group (8.3% and 61.5%, respectively; p = 0.005). The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the steroid group was significantly lower than that in the non-steroid group at the seven-day mark (16.7% and 84.6%, respectively; p = 0.002). Within the steroid group, the incidence of developing secondary complications was also markedly lower than that in the non-steroid group. Conclusions In patients afflicted with non-severe COVID-19, the employment of low-dose, short-course corticosteroids may confer a therapeutic advantage, significantly curtailing the mortality rate, the length of hospital stay, and the risk of developing secondary complications.

We hypothesized that older adults would reduce the number of days driving and number of trips/day they make after COVID-19 case acceleration. Data from 214 adults aged 66.5 to 92.8 years were used. Women comprised 47.6% of the sample and 15.4% were African American. Participants reduced the proportion of days driven during the pandemic (.673 vs. .382 [p < .001]) compared with same period the year before (.695 vs. .749). Trips/day showed a similar decline (p < .001). Participants also took shorter trips (p = .02), drove slower (p < .001), had fewer speeding incidents (p < .001), and had different trip destinations (p < .001).

{"text": "Cardiovascular sequalae in uncomplicated COVID-19 survivors. BACKGROUND: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients were reported to have cardiac involvements. Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance., METHODS: We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID-19 survivors including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, serum troponin and NT-proBNP assay 1-4 weeks after hospital discharge. Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed according to initial screening results., RESULTS: The mean age was 46.5 +/- 18.6 years; 53.6% were men. All were classified with non-severe disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care. Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 42.3% including sinus bradycardia (29.9%), newly detected T-wave abnormality (8.2%), elevated troponin level (6.2%), newly detected atrial fibrillation (1.0%), and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NT-proBNP level (1.0%). Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 7.2% COVID-19 survivors, which appeared to be self-limiting and recovered over time. For COVID-19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction., CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVID-survivors with mild disease, which is mostly self-limiting. Nonetheless, cardiac surveillance in form of ECG and/or serum biomarkers may be advisable to detect more severe cardiac involvement including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with MG and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity in MG patients., METHODS: The CO-MY-COVID registry was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in neuromuscular referral centers and general hospitals of the FILNEMUS network (between March 1, 2020, and June 8, 2020), including MG patients with a confirmed or highly-suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a nasopharyngeal swab and/or SARS-CoV-2 serology, thoracic computed tomography (CT-scan), or typical symptoms. The main outcome was COVID-19 severity based on location of treatment/management (home, hospitalized in a medical unit, or in an intensive care unit). We collected information on demographic variables, general history, and risk factors for severe COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal regression models were used to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes., RESULTS: Among 3,558 MG patients registered in the French database for rare disorders, 34 (0.96%) had COVID-19. The mean age at COVID-19 onset was 55.0 +/-19.9 years (mean MG duration: 8.5 +/- 8.5 years). By the end of the study period, 28 patients recovered from COVID-19, 1 remained affected, and 5 died. Only high Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class (>=IV) before COVID-19 was associated with severe COVID-19 (p=0.004); factors that were not associated included gender, MG duration, and medium MGFA classes (<=IIIb). The type of MG treatment had no independent effect on COVID-19 severity., CONCLUSIONS: This registry-based cohort study shows that COVID-19 had a limited effect on most patients, and immunosuppressive medications and corticosteroids used for MG management are not risk factors for poorer outcomes. However, the risk of severe COVID-19 is elevated in patients with high MGFA classes [odds ratio: 102.6 (4.4; 2,371.9)].

This study examined the association between dynamic angiopoietin-2 assessment and COVID-19 short- and long-term clinical course. We included consecutive hospitalized patients from 1 February to 31 May 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 Italian tertiary referral centers (derivation cohort, n = 187 patients; validation cohort, n = 62 patients). Serum biomarker levels were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissue from 9 patients was stained for angiopoietin-2, Tie2, CD68, and CD34. Cox model was used to identify risk factors for mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess the accuracy of 3- and 10-day angiopoietin-2 for in-hospital mortality and nonresolving pulmonary condition, respectively. Three-day angiopoietin-2 increase of at least twofold from baseline was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 6.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-24.19; P = .004) with AUROC = 0.845 (95% CI, 0.725-0.940). Ten-day angiopoietin-2 of at least twofold from baseline was instead significantly associated with nonresolving pulmonary condition by multivariate analysis (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.34-11.77; P <= .0001) with AUROC = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.919-1.000).

{"text": "Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM improves clinical sensitivity early in disease course. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is diagnosed by molecular-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. Method(s): Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Result(s): Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at > 30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86 and 0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM < 14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG >= 14 days. Conclusion(s): The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV < 14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Setting minimum clinical performance specifications for tests based on disease prevalence and minimum acceptable positive and negative predictive values: Practical considerations applied to COVID-19 testing. Objectives: Several guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have recommended establishing an a priori definition of minimum clinical performance specifications before test selection and method evaluation. Method(s): Using positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), we constructed a spreadsheet tool for determining the minimum clinical specificity (conditional on NPV or PPV, sensitivity and prevalence) and minimum clinical sensitivity (conditional on NPV or PPV, specificity and prevalence) of tests. Result(s): At a prevalence of 1%, there are no minimum sensitivity requirements to achieve a desired NPV of 60%-95% for a given clinical specificity above 20%. It is not possible to achieve 60-95% PPV even with 100% clinical sensitivity, except when the clinical specificity is near 100%. The opposite trend is seen in high prevalence settings (60%), where a relatively low minimum clinical sensitivity is required to achieve a desired PPV for a given clinical specificity, and a higher minimum clinical specificity is required to achieve a desired NPV for a given clinical sensitivity. Discussion(s): The selection of laboratory tests and the testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 involves delicate trade-offs between NPV and PPV based on prevalence and clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Practitioners and health authorities should carefully consider the clinical scenarios under which the test result will be used and select the most appropriate testing strategy that fulfils the a priori defined clinical performance specification.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately affected nursing homes (NH). In Ireland, the first NH case COVID-19 occurred on 16 March 2020. A national point-prevalence testing programme of all NH residents and staff took place (18 April 2020 to 5 May 2020). AIMS: to examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations, proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom profile and resident case fatality. METHOD(S): in total, 45 NHs surveyed, requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases and outcomes for residents from 29 February 2020 to 22 May 2020. RESULT(S): surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2,043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1,741 residents, 1,972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1,741)-40.8% (710/1,741) laboratory confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic and 3.1% (54/1,741) clinically suspected. Resident case fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with 'early-stage' (<28 days) versus 'later-stage' outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in 'early' outbreak NHs had recovered compared with those with 'late' outbreaks (37.4 versus 61.7%; chi2=56.9, P<0.001). Of 395 NH staff across 12 sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho=0.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): this study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the NH sector. Systematic point-prevalence testing is necessary to reduce risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and manage outbreaks in this setting.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "DNA-launched RNA replicon vaccines induce potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in mice. The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its rapid spread into a global pandemic made the urgent development of scalable vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global health and economic imperative. Here, we characterized and compared the immunogenicity of two alphavirus-based DNA-launched self-replicating (DREP) vaccine candidates encoding either SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (DREP-S) or a spike ectodomain trimer stabilized in prefusion conformation (DREP-Secto). We observed that the two DREP constructs were immunogenic in mice inducing both binding and neutralizing antibodies as well as T cell responses. Interestingly, the DREP coding for the unmodified spike turned out to be more potent vaccine candidate, eliciting high titers of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that were able to efficiently neutralize pseudotyped virus after a single immunization. In addition, both DREP constructs were able to efficiently prime responses that could be boosted with a heterologous spike protein immunization. These data provide important novel insights into SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design using a rapid response DNA vaccine platform. Moreover, they encourage the use of mixed vaccine modalities as a strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 setting-specific transmission rates: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Understanding the drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial for control policies but evidence of transmission rates in different settings remains limited., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs., RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of <=5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

Objective(s): To describe our experience of PP as a management strategy for patients with hypoxaemia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) with SRF due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Patients admitted to the ARI ICU between March and May 2020 with respiratory failure and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Retrospective clinical and demographic data were gathered from electronic notes, observation charts and the local incident reporting system. Pa02/Fi02 ratio (P/F) change was calculated using the last value prior to PP and the maximum value during PP. Result(s): 46 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. 16 patients underwent proning during their ICU admission. Demographic data is shown in table 1. There were 52 discrete proning episodes; the maximum number of times a single patient was proned was 12. In 33 episodes the P:F ratio prior to proning placed the patient in the category of severe ARDS. The mean time from admission to first PP was 4.1 days (0-11). Average prone episode duration was 14.6 hours (2-19.5). All prone episodes bar one involved invasive mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. Mode of ventilation when prone comprised 56% volume control and 44% pressure control. Average P/F ratio prior to PP was 13.4 kPa compared to 24.5 kPa during PP. In all proning episodes the P/F ratio improved with a mean percentage increase of 86% (8.7-197.5) (figure 1). The percentage increase for prone episodes involving volume control ventilation was 89% compared to 84% for those involving pressure control ventilation. Complications associated with PP included cardiac arrest on proning (2 cases), brachial plexus injury (1 case) and facial pressure injury (3 cases). ICU mortality was 37.5% for those with prone episodes and 30% in those patients not proned. Conclusion(s): Based on our experience, for patients with moderate to SRF secondary to SARS-CoV-2, PP appears to improve oxygenation. The mode of ventilation does not seem to influence change in oxygenation. PP may be associated with increased risk of pressure damage, nerve injury and haemodynamic instability including cardiac arrest.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Predictive value of the prognostic nutritional index for the severity of coronavirus disease 2019. Objectives: Malnutrition plays a critical role in the onset and progress of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of the present study was to explore the association of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19. Method(s): Clinical data were collected from 122 patients infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, China, a specialized infectious hospital affiliated with the Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI score was calculated as serum albumin (g/L) + 5 x total lymphocyte count (/nL). Result(s): The study population consisted of 105 patients (86.1%) with a common form and 17 patients (13.9%) with a severe form of COVID-19. PNI score significantly decreased from patients with common to severe forms of COVID-19 (P =. 029) regardless of sex, age range, and body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P =. 030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P =. 402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Severity of Chest Imaging is Correlated with Risk of Acute Neuroimaging Findings among Patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Severe respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 has been associated with higher rate of neurologic manifestations. Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P < .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P < .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and acute neuroimaging findings had more severe findings on chest imaging on both radiographs and CT compared with patients with COVID-19 without acute neuroimaging findings. The severity of findings on chest radiography was a strong predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing longterm dialysis may be at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and of associated disease and mortality. We aimed to describe the incidence, risk factors and outcomes for infection in these patients in Ontario, Canada., METHODS: We used linked data sets to compare disease characteristics and mortality between patients receiving longterm dialysis in Ontario who were diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive and those who did not acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, between Mar. 12 and Aug. 20, 2020. We collected data on SARS-CoV-2 infection prospectively. We evaluated risk factors for infection and death using multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: During the study period, 187 (1.5%) of 12 501 patients undergoing dialysis were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 117 (62.6%) were admitted to hospital and the case fatality rate was 28.3%. Significant predictors of infection included in-centre hemodialysis versus home dialysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-4.05), living in a long-term care residence (OR 7.67, 95% CI 5.30-11.11), living in the Greater Toronto Area (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.21-4.80), Black ethnicity (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.95-4.77), Indian subcontinent ethnicity (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.81), other non-White ethnicities (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.38-2.97) and lower income quintiles (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15-2.89)., INTERPRETATION: Patients undergoing long-term dialysis are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from coronavirus disease 2019.

{"text": "Rebooting atrial fibrillation ablation in the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: Catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AF) were significantly curtailed during the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to conserve healthcare resources and limit exposure. There is little data regarding peri-procedural outcomes of medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. We enacted protocols to safely reboot AF ablation while limiting healthcare resource utilization. We aimed to evaluate acute and subacute outcomes of protocols instituted for reboot of AF ablation during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Perioperative healthcare utilization and acute procedural outcomes were analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation under COVID-19 protocols (2020 cohort; n=111) and compared to those of patients who underwent AF ablation during the same time period in 2019 (2019 cohort; n=200). Newly implemented practices included preoperative COVID-19 testing, selective transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), utilization of venous closure, and same-day discharge when clinically appropriate., RESULTS: Pre-ablation COVID-19 testing was positive in 1 of 111 patients. There were 0 cases ablation-related COVID-19 transmission and 0 major complications in either cohort. Pre-procedure TEE was performed in significantly fewer 2020 cohort patients compared to the 2019 cohort patients (68.4% vs. 97.5%, p <0.001, respectively) despite greater prevalence of persistent arrhythmia in the 2020 cohort. Same-day discharge was achieved in 68% of patients in the 2020 cohort, compared to 0% of patients in the 2019 cohort., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of safe resumption of complex electrophysiology procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing healthcare utilization and maintaining quality of care.

{"text": "Factors associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody production in patients convalescing from COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the factors that affect anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody production remain unclear. This study aimed to identify such factors among patients convalescing from COVID-19., METHODS: This study comprised patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and June 30, 2020 and gave consent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during their acute and/or convalescent phases. Factors related to elevated antibody titers and the relationship between the days from disease onset and the development of antibody titers were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 84 participants enrolled in the study. Nineteen participants had antibody titers measured during the convalescent phase only, and 65 participants had antibody titers measured during the acute and convalescent phases. The antibody titers peaked in weeks 5 and 6. The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers., CONCLUSION: The study found that high values of maximum CRP levels during the acute phase, male sex, and diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated antibody titers. Antibody titers tended to be highest in the first 5 or 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 testing: The tower of babel. Summary. Background and aim: Testing represents one of the main pillars of public health response to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. This paper shows how accuracy and utility of testing programs depend not just on the type of tests, but on the context as well. Method(s): We describe the testing methods that have been developed and the possible testing strategies; then, we focus on two possible methods of population-wide testing, i.e., pooled testing and testing with rapid antigen tests. We show the accuracy of split-pooling method and how, in different pre-test probability scenarios, the positive and negative predictive values vary using rapid antigen tests. Result(s): Split-pooling, followed by retesting of negative results, shows a higher sensitivity than individual testing and requires fewer tests. In case of low pre-test probability, a negative result with antigen test could allow to rule out the infection, while, in case of a positive result, a confirmatory molecular test would be necessary. Conclusion(s): Test performance alone is not enough to properly choose which test to use; goals and context of the testing program are essential. We advocate the use of pooled strategies when planning population-wide screening, and the weekly use of rapid tests for close periodic monitoring in low-prevalence populations.

Objectives: With the worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), various antibody detection kits have been developed to test for SARS-CoV-2- specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody. However, the use of different testing methods under various heat-inactivation conditions might affect the COVID-19 detection results. Methods: Seven different antibody detection kits produced by four manufacturers for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and total antibody were tested at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China. Most of the kits used the indirect immunity, capture, and double-antigen sandwich methods. The effects of various heat-inactivation conditions on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody detection were analyzed for the different test methods. Results: Using the indirect immunity method, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody significantly increased and those for IgM antibody decreased with increasing temperature of heat-inactivation using indirect immunity method. However, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and total antibody showed no change when the capture and double-antigen sandwich methods were used. The changes in IgG and IgM antibody values with the indirect immunity method indicated that heat-inactivation could affect COVID-19 detection results obtained using this method. In particular, 18 (22.2%) SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive samples were detected as negative with heat-inactivation at 65degreeC for 30 min, and one (25%) IgG negative sample was detected as positive after heat-inactivation at 56degreeC for 60 min and 60degreeC for 30 min. Conclusions: Heat-inactivation could increase SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody values, and decrease IgM antibody values, causing potential false-positive or false-negative results for COVID-19 antibody detection using the indirect immunity method. Thus, before conducting antibody testing, the testing platforms should be evaluated in accordance with the relevant requirements to ensure accurate COVID-19 detection results.

Method: An ODE based mathematical model was constructed by extending the classical SEIR model to predict the seroprevalence rate in Delhi. We estimated the parameter values for Delhi using available data (reported cases and the seroprevalence rate) and used them for future prediction. We also attempted to capture the changes in the seroprevalence rate with different possibilities of reinfection. <h4>Results:</h4> Maximum seroprevalence rate obtained through our model is 31.65% and also a reduction in the seroprevalence rate was observed for the upcoming one month (month of January, 2021) due to the reduced transmission rate. After increasing the transmission rate to the value same as the third wave in New Delhi, we obtained a maximum value of 54.96%. This maximum value significantly decreased with the reduction in the reinfection possibilities. Also, a little impact of the duration of persistence of antibodies, 180 vs 105 days, was observed on the maximum seroprevalence. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> This modelling study suggests that natural infection alone, as gauged by serial sero-surveys, will not result in attainment of herd immunity in the state of Delhi.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Staff testing for COVID-19 via an online pre-registration form. Background: Healthcare workers are at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and potentially causing institutional outbreaks. Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals, whilst also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. We aimed to identify specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): A retrospective descriptive study design involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Result(s): Of 799 clients, most were young and females with few comorbidities. Nurses formed the largest staff contingent in the study, followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared with other staff (median: 1.5 vs. 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms included headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n = 105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, and chills were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms were more predictive of a positive test, but 12/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion(s): Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. Whilst some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it. Staff testing should form part of a bundle of strategies to protect staff, including wearing masks, regular handwashing, buddy screening, physical distancing, availability of personal protective equipment and special dispensation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related leave.Copyright \u00a9 2021.

Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS) act primarily by altering the immune system. While many DMTs have well understood mechanisms of action, the consequences of immunomodulation in the setting of exposure to a novel viral pathogen were largely unknown until recently. Objective(s): Analyze clinical outcomes and risk of treatment with DMTs among patients with MS and related disorders who contracted COVID-19. Method(s): From March 10to July 1st, 2020, patients with MS and related disorders at RWJBH MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCCC) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified. The diagnosis was established through the nurse triage telephone line, telehealth visits with physicians, and review of medical records with subsequent clinical follow up. Result(s): We identified 25 patients (13 with relapsing MS; 11 with progressive MS; and 1 with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)) with laboratory-confirmed COVID19, either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing for SARSCoV- 2 antibodies.

Introduction: A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) emerged in early December 2019 and has subsequently spread globally causing a pandemic. There remains clinical equipoise on whether the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is higher in those patients with acute respiratory failure caused by SARSCoV- 2 (Covid-19) than those without Covid-19 [1, 2, 3]. Objective(s): To assess whether the incidence of AKI among patients admitted with acute respiratory failure caused by Covid-19 infection is higher than those with acute respiratory failure without Covid-19 infection. To describe the differences in AKI stages observed between the two groups. Method(s): This was a single centre, observational cohort study. Patients admitted with acute respiratory failure to the ICU at St George's Hospital were recruited to the study between December 2019 and May 2020. Covid-19 infection was detected by viral PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal or sputum samples. The presence and stage of AKI was defined as per AKIN criteria [4] and assessed on day 0, 7 and 14 of ICU admission. Univariate analysis was conducted using the Chi squared test to compare the frequency of AKI between the two groups. Result(s): 256 patients were included. 132 (51.6%) were Covid-19 patients, whereas 124 (48.6%) were non-Covid-19 ICU patients. Overall, 226 (88.3%) patients had AKI over the study period; 112 (84.8%) within the Covid-19 group and 114 (91.9%) within the non-Covid-19 group (c2 (1) 3.1, p = 0.058). On ICU admission, the distribution of AKI stages between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients was similar (c2 (3) 2.0, p = 0.58). At day 7 of admission, 127 patients were still in ICU - 88 in the Covid- 19 group and 39 in the non-Covid-19 group. There were 45 (51.1%) in stage 0, 8 (9.1%) in stage 1, 6 (6.8%) in stage 2 and 29 (33%) in stage 3 within the the Covid-19 group, compared to 32 (82.1%) in stage 0, 3 (7.7%) in stage 1, 2 (5.1%) in stage 2 and 2 (5.1%) in stage 3 within the non-Covid-19 group (c2 (3) 13.0, p = 0.004). At day 14, 71 patients remained in ICU, and the distribution of stages was similar between both groups (c2 (3) 4.9, p = 0.16).

{"text": "Enforcement of Stay-at-home Orders Associated with Improved COVID-19 Population Outcomes. Purpose: State governors enacted social distancing restrictions and other measures to curb the rapid person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. Many states imposed movement restrictions via Stay-At-Home (SAH) directives, although enforcement guidelines varied between states with unknown efficacy. COVID-19 remains highly prevalent and many states are reconsidering restrictions. Therefore, an examination of how government enforcement of SAH orders affects COVID-19 outcomes is necessary to determine. Method(s): COVID-19 case counts and deaths were aggregated from state health data while government policies were evaluated from official correspondences. Multivariable negative binomial regression was conducted to compare COVID-19 incidence and deaths per day per capita in states with law-enforceable \"stay-at-home\" (eSAH) orders vs. those with unenforceable or no SAH orders (uSAH). Rates were controlled for state demographics, comorbidity prevalence, and socioeconomic factors. Result(s): The rate ratio (RR) of COVID-19 incidence and deaths per day is 0.64 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.72; p<0.001) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.99; p=0.045), respectively, in eSAH states compared to uSAH states. The number of incidences and deaths for SAH enforcement were fewer by 0.375 and 0.221 per day per capita, respectively. Conclusion(s): States with enforcement guidelines included in their SAH executive orders were associated with significantly decreased COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Enforcement of additional public health measures such as mask wearing may similarly increase compliance and improve outcomes. Future investigations should study the effect of other concurrent health measures on COVID-19 outcomes.

The most frequently affected personnel were nurses (48%, 95% CI: 41, 56), whereas most of the COVID-19-positive medical personnel were working in hospital nonemergency wards during screening (43%, 95% CI: 28, 59). Anosmia, fever, and myalgia were the only symptoms associated with HCW SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among HCWs positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 40% (95% CI: 17, 65) were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis. Finally, severe clinical complications developed in 5% (95% CI: 3, 8) of the COVID-19-positive HCWs, and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.02, 1.3) died. Health-care workers suffer a significant burden from COVID-19, with those working in hospital nonemergency wards and nurses being the most commonly infected personnel.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "Use of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis to Reduce Admission of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients to the Adult Emergency Department: An Institutional Experience. Background: Failure mode and effect analysis is an important tool to identify failures in a system with its possible cause, effect, and set actions to be implemented proactively before the occurrence of problems. This study tries to identify common failure modes with its possible causes and effect to the health service and to plot actions to be implemented to reduce COVID-19 transmission to clients, staff, and subsequent service compromise from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients visiting the adult emergency department of SPHMMC (non-COVID-19 setup)., Method and Study Design: A multidisciplinary team, representing different divisions of the adult emergency department at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), was chosen. This team was trained on failure mode and effect analysis and basics of COVID-19, to identify possible causes of failures and their potential effects, to calculate a risk priority number (RPN) for each failure, and plan changes in practice., Results: A total of 22 failure modes and 89 associated causes and effects were identified. Many of these failure modes (12 out of 22) were found in all steps of patient flow and were associated with either due to lack of or failure to apply standard and transmission-based precautions. This suggests the presence of common targets for improvement, particularly in enhancing the safety of staff and clients. As a result of this FMEA, 23 general improvement actions were proposed., Conclusion: FMEA can be used as a useful tool for anticipating potential failures in the process and proposing improvement actions that could help in reducing secondary transmissions during the pandemic.

{"text": "Evaluation of different respiratory samples and saliva for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA. Objective: We aimed to analyse the positivity rate and cycle threshold values indicating viral loads for SARS CoV-2 among different respiratory specimens and also to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of saliva samples. Material(s) and Method(s): We included combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab (cONS), sputum, and tracheal aspirate (TA) specimens of patients. Unpreserved saliva samples were collected prospectively from hospitalized patients within 72 hours of admission. SARS CoV-2 RNA was extracted by using Bio-Speedy viral nucleic acid buffer than RT-PCR was performed with Bio-Speedy COVID-19 qPCR detection kit. Result(s): Retrospective evaluation revealed SARS CoV-2 RNA in 19.66% of cONS (n: 5819), 30.77% of sputum (n: 39), 29.41% of TA samples (n: 34) from 4812 patients. In the majority (86.72%) of the samples, the first cONS sample was positive. Consecutive cONS and sputum/TA samples were investigated in 52 patients of whom 11 were positive with either of these samples. Saliva positivity was detected in 60% of cONS positive (n: 20) and 30% of cONS negative (n: 12) patients. Conclusion(s): Although, cONS samples show the greatest diagnostic guidance, repeated sampling from multiple sites of the respiratory tract increases the possibility of COVID-19 diagnosis.

{"text": "The HLA and ABO genetic background impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. At the beginning of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been defined by the WHO as a global health emergency. A peculiar feature of this infection is the extreme variability in clinical presentation, ranging from very mild sub-clinical flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality. This heterogenous presentation poses the question whether individual variability of immune response to the virus can be influenced by genetic factors. Specifically, it is unknown whether HLA and AB0 can explain the different prevalence in population of SARSCoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution. To address this point, a retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by subjects who received organ transplantation and candidates in a waiting list in a 2002-March 2020 time frame. A total of 56,304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (COVID+) or absence (COVID-) of SARSCoV-2 infection. The prevalence of COVID was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted and transplanted patients. HLA-B*51 and HLA-DRB1*08 were more frequent in COVID+ compared to COVID-, while HLA-DRB1*07 showed a protective effect. In transplant recipients, HLA-DRB1*08 was an indicator of mortality (1.9% in living vs 15.2% in the deceased, OR=9.4 95%CI [1.9-47.3]; P=.006). Moreover, blood group A was more frequent in COVID+ (45.5%) than in COVID-(39.0%). Overall, this study shows for the first time that some HLA antigens influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution and confirms that blood group A subjects are at greater risk of infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective While evidence on the interface between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is accumulating, clinical data on RAAS peptide alteration among coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients is missing. Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged >=18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The managing of patients who receive immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs rapidly has to change during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Immunosuppression therapy combined with neurological disability such as multiple sclerosis (MS) increases the risk of severe COVID-19 and associated death. Hence, evaluating the risk of Covid-19 in MS patients is an important issue in global healthcare system and demand for data to describe the frequency and the evolution of COVID-19 infection in MS patients grows rapidly around the world. Objective(s): We report our descriptive-analytic study on MS patients with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This study was conducted in south of Iran, an area with a high prevalence and incidence of MS. It is also worth noting that Iran is high in prevalence of COVID- 19 and this study was performed in the first pandemic wave in Iran. Method(s): 1361 MS patients from fars province, south of Iran were contacted from April 3 to June 20, 2020. Basic demographic data, information about MS disease and any signs, symptoms or laboratory results relevant to COVID-19 were gathered. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): The frequency of DMT were as follow: rituximab 27.6%, interferons 27.3%, fingolimod 12.5%, dimethyl fumarate 9.1%, glatiramer acetate 7.3%, teriflunomide 1.9%, natalizumab 1.3%. Out of 1361 patients, 68 (5) % were COVID-19 suspected cases. 12 patients showed serious clinical symptoms and required hospital admission. 8 cases had positive PCR, 6 of confirmed cases did not require ICU care or intubation and were discharged from the hospital. 2 of the COVID-19 confirmed cases died. Both of them were on rituximab. The highest frequency of suspected cases had RRMS 87.7%, followed by PPMS7.7% and the lowest percentage of suspected cases was observed in SPMS patients 1.5%. 50% of confirmed cases and 12.5% of suspected cases were on rituximab. .There was significant difference in frequency rate of patients who used corticosteroid (p <0.005) and cardiovascular drugs (p =0.04). 62.5% of confirmed cases had EDSS 6 or higher while 6.4% of suspected and 10.1% of healthy cases requires assistance to walk. In the multivariable regression model, CVD and hyperthyroidism were independently associated with the risk of the suspect or confirmed COVID-19. Patients with hyperthyroidism and CVD were approximately 21.3 and 3.6 times higher at risk of infection.( OR=21.3 95% CL2.95-55.08 P=0.002) (OR=3.69 95% CL1.47-9.21, P=0.005) respectively.

{"text": "A model for COVID-19 with isolation, quarantine and testing as control measures. In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: social distancing, isolation of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.

Background: The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown measures have had a major impact on societies around the world, leading to sleep problems for a large part of the population. In order to assess the sustainability of sleeping troubles related to the sanitary crisis, it was crucial to measure its prevalence after the end of the Covid-19 confinement. Method(s): As part of an epidemiological survey on Covid and Confinement (COCONEL), we enquired on sleep disorders using two items in 4 repetitive cross-sectional surveys. The first took place during the first week of the French confinement (March 31 to April 2; N = 1005 participants). The second took place in the middle of this period (April 15-17; N = 1005). The two last surveys were held at the end of the confinement (May 7-10; N = 2003) and one month after the end (June 10-12; N = 1736). Using a random constant, the mixed model took into account the longitudinal character of the last two waves (intra-individual correlations for individuals surveyed in waves 3 and 4). Result(s): The prevalence of sleep problems significantly decreased during the last weeks of the confinement, and this trend was confirmed one month after the end of confinement. One quarter of the population reported that their sleep was better one month after the end of the confinement. Sleep improvement was reported more often by women and people aged less than 65. Such improvement was less frequent among those who were still highly exposed to the pandemic's media coverage after the end of the confinement. Conclusion(s): The possibility of recovering a good sleep largely depends on the type of sleep disorder. The decrease in sleep problems occurred mainly among people with mild sleep problems during the confinement. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its confinement period on sleep quality in the general population.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Inactivation of Human Coronavirus by Fathhome\u2019s Dry Sanitizer Device: Rapid and Eco-friendly Ozone-based Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic history of pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 associated COVID-19 infection began in December 2019, with its emergence in Wuhan, China. Pertaining to its high transmissibility and wide host adaptability, this new and unique human coronavirus spread across the planet affecting almost every country, inflicting 91 million people and causing 1.9 million deaths (as of January 17th, 2021). Limited or negligible pre-existing immunity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a record-breaking surge in the use of medical-surgical supplies and personal protective equipments. In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOME&rsquo;s self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm of ozone for 10 min exposure, which was able to effectively reduce, 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log10 reduction) with 25 ppm ozone for 15 mins on both tested surfaces. As expected, a higher ozone concentration (50 ppm) resulted in faster inactivation of HCoV-OC43 with 100% inactivation in 10 mins from both the surfaces, with no residual ozone present after completion of the 5-minute post exposure recapture cycle and no measurable increase in ambient ozone levels. These results confirmed that FATHHOME&rsquo;s device may provide a safe and viable solution for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2- from worn items, frequently touched items, and PPE including N95 FFRs, face shields and other personal items.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Aim: In this retrospective single-center study, we report our experience with a cohort of children admitted to our hospital in Al Ain City, United Arab Emirates, with confirmed COVID-19. We also compare our findings to similar reports in the literature. Patients and Methods: Between 1st March and 31st May 2020, we reviewed the electronic patient medical records of all children with confirmed COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) managed in Al Ain hospital, designated as the only COVID-19 center in the city. Results: There were 288 children admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 during the study period (mean age 7.3 years, median 6.5, range 1 month to 16.9 years). The age-specific point prevalence was the highest under the age of 5 years (mean 2.0 per 1,000, 95% ci 1.7, 2.4) and decreased progressively to 0.6 per 1,000 (95% ci 0.4, 0.9) over the age of 14 years. Hospital admission was required for 193 (67%) children while 95 (33%) were discharged from the emergency department. Most children (n = 214, 74%) had been exposed to a family member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and asthma which was the most frequent comorbidity (n = 37, 13%). The most common symptoms were cough (n = 130, 45%), fever (n = 14, 4.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 93, 32.3%), and lower respiratory tract infection in 28 (9.7%). None of the children presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurological symptoms, sepsis, or septic shock. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count or ANC< 1.5 x 109/L) was observed in 10.4% and thrombocytopenia (<150 platelets x 109/L) in 72% of children. Nineteen patients (9%) had abnormal imaging studies (chest X-ray and chest computed tomography). Abnormalities were bilateral in six (43%), right-sided in seven (50%) with only one child (7%) with left-sided involvement. None of the children required invasive respiratory support, but four (1.4%) required noninvasive respiratory support. The median length of hospital stay was 3.3 days [1.9, 5.9]. There were no deaths in the hospital even in those with comorbidities. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous reports of mild illness of COVID-19 in our child population, even in those with comorbidities. The age-standardized prevalence was higher in children (<5 years) compared to young adolescents.

{"text": "Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?. Air pollution with particulate matter has been implicated in the incidence and the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R0) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus' transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking (66% of Chinese males are smokers), may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19's vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The \"open orientation\" of Clade G spike protein's three peptides as opposed to the \"closed orientation\" of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein's hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients including young infants. Pediatric cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are generally mild or asymptomatic, and are usually detected by virological examination following close contact with COVID-19 patients, often the children's parents. The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric patients with COVID-19, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of four children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Digging Signatures in 13-Month-Old 3xTg-AD Mice for Alzheimer's Disease and Its Disruption by Isolation Despite Social Life Since They Were Born. The severity of this pandemic's scenarios will leave significant psychological traces in low resistant and resilient individuals. Increased incidence of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder has already been reported. The loss of human lives and the implementation of physical distance measures in the pandemic and post-COVID scenarios may have a greater impact on the elderly, mostly in those with dementia, as OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are quite prevalent in this population. Modeling NPS in animals relies in neuroethological perspectives since the response to new situations and traumatic events, critical for survival and adaptation to the environment, is strongly preserved in the phylogeny. In the laboratory, mice dig vigorously in deep bedding to bury food pellets or small objects they may find. This behavior, initially used to screen anxiolytic activity, was later proposed to model better meaningless repetitive and perseverative behaviors characteristic of OCD or autism spectrum disorders. Other authors found that digging can also be understood as part of the expression of the animals' general activity. In the present brief report, we studied the digging ethograms in 13-month-old non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice modeling normal aging and advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. This genetic model presents AD-like cognitive dysfunction and NPS-like phenotype, with high mortality rates at this age, mostly in males. This allowed us to observe the digging pattern's disruption in a subgroup of 3xTg-AD mice that survived to their cage mates. Two digging paradigms involving different anxiogenic and contextual situations were used to investigate their behavior. The temporal course and intensity of digging were found to increase in those 3xTg-AD mice that had lost their \"room partners\" despite having lived in social structures since they were born. However, when tested under neophobia conditions, this behavior's incidence was low (delayed), and the temporal pattern was disrupted, suggesting worsening of this NPS-like profile. The outcomes showed that this combined behavioral paradigm unveiled distinct features of digging signatures that can be useful to study these perseverative behaviors and their interplay with anxiety states already present in the AD scenario and their worsening by naturalistic/forced isolation.

It is known that diabetes, high body mass index, high glycated hemoglobin and raised serum IL-6 levels are predictive of poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The immunopathological mechanisms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection include rising levels of several cytokines and in particular IL-6. The latter is associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and could be useful for predicting the development of GDM. Rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, MedDiet improves the immune system and could modulate IL-6, C reactive protein and Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB. Moreover, polyphenols could modulate microbiota composition, inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway, lower IL-6, and upregulate antioxidant enzymes. Finally, adhering to the MedDiet prior to and during pregnancy could have a protective effect, reducing GWG and the risk of GDM, as well as improving the immune response to viral infections such as COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: We aimed to assess the incidence of hospital deliveries and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic (Co19) lockdown, March 10th, and May 12th, 2020 as compared to the parallel time (preCo19) March 10th and May 12th, 2019. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study conducted at a single tertiary center in Jerusalem, Israel; to evaluate the adverse maternal, labor, and neonatal outcomes between the two epochs. The medical care protocols were strict and unchanged during the study period. Result(s): During the study epochs, 5002 deliveries were attended;2343 (46.8%) in the Co19 and 2665 (53.2%) in the pre-Co19; a reduction of 13.7%, p<0.01. The Co19 parturients were characterized by a lower rate of hypertensive disorders. During Co19 epoch, labor induction and augmentation rate were higher (15.5% vs. 12.8%, %, p=0.02 and 62.1% vs. 25.9%, p<0.01, respectively) as well as the rate of planned and in labor cesarean deliveries (6.3% vs. 6.0% and 6.4% vs. 5.8%, p<0.01, respectively); the rate of the instrumental delivery was significantly lower (6.8% vs. 15.4%, p<0.01). The median time from admission to active labor shortened (141 min vs. 161 min, p<0.01); the median length of labor and the time spent in the delivery room was longer (230 min vs. 202 min and 112 vs. 99, p<0.01, respectively ). The hospitalization time was shorter (1.54 vs 1.84, p<0.01); however, with comparable maternal readmission rates (0.6% vs 0.6%, p=0.83). Neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the epochs. Conclusion(s): The significant reduction in the hospital deliveries, albeit a higher rate of cesarean deliveries, was associated with a shorter hospital stay and no change in the maternal and neonatal outcome. we speculate that these changes were due to patients' anxiety rather than the disease itself. Therefore, some deliveries drifted to lower Co19 areas, and some delivered with planned home births. Since the practice remained unchanged, we assume that the complicated deliveries remained at the tertiary center and influenced the cesarean rate.

{"text": "Cardiac involvement in consecutive elite athletes recovered from Covid-19: A magnetic resonance study. Magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested cardiac involvement post-Covid-19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes. This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal swabs are the primary sampling method used for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they require a trained health care professional and extensive personal protective equipment. PURPOSE: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION(S): Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Background: Lung transplantation is particularly susceptible to the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and evaluation of changes to practice is required to inform future decision-making. Method(s): A retrospective review of the UK Transplant Registry (UKTR) and national survey of UK lung transplant centers has been performed. Result(s): There was geographic variation in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across the UK. The number of donors fell by 48% during the early pandemic period. Lung utilization fell to 10% (compared with 24% for the same period of 2019). The number of lung transplants performed fell by 77% from 53, March to May 2019, to 12. Seven (58%) of these were performed in a single-center, designated \"COVID-light.\" The number of patients who died on the lung transplant waiting list increased, compared to the same period of 2019 (p =.0118). Twenty-six lung transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were reported during the study period.

{"text": "Antiviral Activity of Reagents in Mouth Rinses against SARS-CoV-2. The oral cavity, an essential part of the upper aerodigestive tract, is believed to play an important role in the pathogenicity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The identification of targeted antiviral mouth rinses to reduce salivary viral load would contribute to reducing the COVID-19 pandemic. While awaiting the results of significant clinical studies, which to date do not exist, the commercial availability of mouth rinses leads us to search among them for reagents that would have specific antiviral properties with respect to SARS-CoV-2. The challenges facing this target were examined for 7 reagents found in commercially available mouth rinses and listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website: povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, cyclodextrin, Citrox, cetylpyridinium chloride, and essential oils. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, many reagents target the outer lipid membrane. Moreover, some of them can act on the capsid by denaturing proteins. Until now, there has been no scientific evidence to recommend mouth rinses with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect to control the viral load in the oral cavity. This critical review indicates that current knowledge of these reagents would likely improve trends in salivary viral load status. This finding is a strong sign to encourage clinical research for which quality protocols are already available in the literature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Northern Italy has been the first European area affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictive measures. We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PICU admissions in Northern Italy, using data from the Italian Network of Pediatric Intensive Care Units Registry. We included all patients admitted to 4 PICUs from 8-weeks-before to 8-weeks-after February 24th, 2020, and those admitted in the same period in 2019. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) evaluating incidence rate differences between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods in 2020 (IRR-1), as well as between the post-COVID-19-period with the same period in 2019 (IRR-2), were computed using zero-inflated negative binomial or Poisson regression modeling. A total of 1001 admissions were included. The number of PICU admissions significantly decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and compared to the same period in 2020 (IRR-1 0.63 [95%CI 0.50-0.79]; IRR-2 0.70 [CI 0.57-0.91]).

Background: Imaging of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described in adults, but children have milder forms of disease. Pediatric imaging descriptions are of asymptomatic children, raising the question of whether imaging is needed in this patient group. Objective(s): To describe the utilization and imaging findings in children with COVID-19 along with the comorbidities, treatment and short-term outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who had a confirmed positive test for COVID-19 during a 2-month period. We noted symptoms and presence of imaging at presentation. Comorbidities were recorded for children with imaging. Children were categorized as having multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) if they met criteria for the disorder. For children who were admitted to the hospital, we documented length of hospital stay, need for intensive care unit care/ventilator support, and treatment regimen. We evaluated all imaging for acute/chronic abnormalities including chest radiographs for interstitial or alveolar opacities, distribution/symmetry of disease, zonal predominance, and pleural abnormalities. We performed descriptive statistics and compared children with MIS-C with the cohort using a Fisher exact test. Result(s): During the study period, 5,969 children were tested for COVID-19, with 313 (5%) testing positive. Of these, 92/313 (29%) were asymptomatic and 55/313 (18%) had imaging and were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Forty-one of 55 patients (75%) with imaging had comorbidities. Chest radiographs were the most common examination (51/55 patients, or 93%) with most demonstrating no abnormality (34/51, or 67%). Children with MIS-C were more likely to have interstitial opacities and pleural effusions. US, CT or MRI was performed in 23/55 (42%) children, 9 of whom had MIS-C. Only one chest CT was performed. Conclusion(s): In our study, most pediatric patients with COVID-19 did not require hospital admission or imaging. Most children with imaging had comorbidities but children with MIS-C were more likely to have no comorbidities. Children with imaging mostly had normal chest radiography.

{"text": "Meat Processing Facilities and County Level Risk Factors for COVID-19. Purpose: More than 30,000 meat production workers have reported COVID-19 infections. The purpose was to determine if counties with higher proportions of population employed in meat processing had higher incidence of COVID-19 infection after accounting for other population level risk factors. Method(s): COVID-19 case data were obtained from the COVID-19 Data. The proportion of population employed at meat processing facilities was obtained from Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other county level variables included race/ethnicity, poverty, education, population residing in nursing home facilities; jail population, and presence of a prison facility. Poisson regression generated incidence rate ratios (IRR) to model the association between proportion employed in meat processing and the incidence of COVID-19 while controlling for other factors. State was also included as a covariate to account for differences in testing between states. Maps with county level risk estimates were generated to visualize potential hotspots. Result(s): Counties with higher proportion of employment in meat processing facilities had significantly higher incidence of COVID-19 (IRR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.76-1.78) after adjusting for other county level variables. Controlling for differences between states resulted in a significantly higher rate of COVID-19 in counties with higher proportions employed in meat processing facilities (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.24-1.26). Counties with higher proportion of Black and Hispanic populations, higher nursing home populations, and a prison located in the county also had significantly higher incidence of COVID-19.

A first wave is visible up to the end of June 2020 in many regions. This article presents a review of the current knowledge on the epidemiology and prevention. The SARS-CoV-2 predominantly replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is particularly transmitted by droplets and aerosols. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5-10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts.

{"text": "Predictors for development of critical illness amongst older adults with COVID-19: Beyond age to age-associated factors. Introduction: Older adults with COVID-19 have disproportionately higher rates of severe disease and mortality. It is unclear whether this is attributable to age or attendant age-associated risk factors. This retrospective cohort study aims to characterize hospitalized older adults and examine if comorbidities, frailty and acuity of clinical presentation exert an age-independent effect on COVID-19 severity. Method(s): We studied 275 patients admitted to the National Centre of Infectious Disease, Singapore. We measured: 1)Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI) as burden of comorbidities; 2)Clinical Frailty Scale(CFS) and Frailty Index(FI); and 3)initial acuity. We studied characteristics and outcomes of critical illness, stratified by age groups (50-59,60-69 and >=70). We conducted hierarchical logistic regression in primary model(N = 262, excluding direct admissions to intensive care unit) and sensitivity analysis(N = 275): age and gender in base model, entering CCI, frailty (CFS or FI) and initial acuity sequentially. Result(s): The >=70 age group had highest CCI(p<.001), FI(p<.001) and CFS(p<.001), and prevalence of geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy,53.5%; urinary symptoms,37.5%; chronic pain,23.3% and malnutrition,23.3%). Thirty-two (11.6%) developed critical illness. In the primary regression model, age was not predictive for critical illness when a frailty predictor was added. Significant predictors in the final model (AUC 0.809) included male gender (p=.012), CFS (p=.038), and high initial acuity (p=.021) but not CCI or FI. In sensitivity analysis, FI (p=.028) but not CFS was significant. Conclusion(s): In hospitalized older adults with COVID-19, geriatric syndromes are not uncommon. Acuity of clinical presentation and frailty are important age-independent predictors of disease severity. CFS and FI provide complimentary information in predicting interval disease progression and rapid disease progression respectively.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: COVID-19 infection may be associated with placental changes including vasculopathy and thrombosis. The extent to which these findings translate to perinatal outcomes and correlate to symptomatology is unclear. The aim of the study is to examine whether placentally related perinatal outcomes differ in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic COVID positive women. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of women with singleton gestations diagnosed with COVID infection by PCR and admitted to our institution for delivery from 3/12- 8/12/20. Women were categorized as symptomatic if they had COVID symptoms prior to or at presentation for delivery or developed any until discharge. Asymptomatic women did not develop any symptoms during the same period. Pregnancies with major congenital anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was a perinatal composite of any of the following: small for gestational age, preeclampsia or abruption. Secondary outcomes are listed in Table 1. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables. We fit a logistic regression model to adjust for confounders. Result(s): Of 189 COVID positive women admitted for delivery, 157 met inclusion criteria. 95(60.5%) women were asymptomatic and 62(39.4%) symptomatic. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups(Table 1A). The primary outcome was similar between the groups (24.2% vs 21%, p=0.64). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of birthweight, mode of delivery, NICU admission, blood transfusion or ICU admission. There were no cases of VTE.

Background: The spectrum of pre-existing renal disease is known as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with diabetic nephropathy in comparison to patients with chronic kidney disease. Method(s): We used the Mexican Open Registry of COVID-19 patients 11 to analyze anonymized records of those who had symptoms related to COVID-19 to analyze the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, admission, intubation, Intensive Care Unit admission and mortality. Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. Result(s): The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was an 87.9% higher probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% higher probability of being admitted, a 101.7% higher probability of intubation and a 20.8% higher probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01).

The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease has spread quickly and massively around the entire globe, causing millions of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. The disease poses a serious ongoing threat to public health. This study aims to understand the disease potential of the virus in different regions by studying how average spring temperature and its strong predictor, latitude, affect epidemiological variables such as disease incidence, mortality, recovery cases, active cases, testing rate, and hospitalization. We also seek to understand the association of temperature and geographic coordinates with viral genomics. Epidemiological data along with temperature, latitude, longitude, and preparedness index were collected for different countries and US states during the early stages of the pandemic. Our worldwide epidemiological analysis showed a significant correlation between temperature and incidence, mortality, recovery cases and active cases. The same tendency was found with latitude, but not with longitude. In the US, we observed no correlation between temperature or latitude and epidemiological variables. Interestingly, longitude was correlated with incidence, mortality, active cases, and hospitalization. An analysis of mutational change and mutational change per time in 55 453 aligned SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed these parameters were uncorrelated with temperature and geographic coordinates. The epidemiological trends we observed worldwide suggest a seasonal effect for the disease that is not directly controlled by the genomic makeup of the virus.

{"text": "Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric COVID-19 and Predictors of PCR Positivity. BACKGROUND: To identify the clinical findings and outcomes of children with COVID-19 and factors predicting RT-PCR positivity. METHOD(S): The data retrospectively analyzed for suspected and confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients between March 20 and May 31, 2020. RESULT(S): There were 404 children, of them, 176 (43.6%) patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 which were less symptomatic on admission (67.6% to 95.6%). Cough (44.9%), fever (38.1%), sore throat (18.5%), and smell-taste loss (12.7%) were the most common symptoms. Confirmed cases had 92.6% identified history of contact with COVID-19. Close contact with COVID-19 positive family members and coughs increased the RT-PCR positivity 23.8 and 5.0 times, respectively; while positivity decreased by 0.4 times if fever was over 38degreeC. Asymptomatic and mild cases were categorized as 'group 1' (n=153), moderate, severe and critical cases as 'group 2' (n=23) in terms of disease severity. Group 2 cases had higher C-reactive protein (40.9% to 15.9%) and procalcitonin (22.7% to 4.9%) levels and had more frequent lymphopenia (45.5% to 13.1%). Out of 23 cases, 19 had abnormal chest x-ray findings; of them, 15 patients underwent chest CTs, and all had abnormal findings. However, 26.0% of them needed respiratory support, and no patient required invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION(S): Children with COVID-19 have milder clinical course and SARS-CoV-2 rarely causes severe disease in children. Contact history with COVID-19 and sore throat are the most important predictors for RT-PCR positivity. Consequently, the role of asymptomatic children in the contamination chain must be fully established and considered for the control of pandemic.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was appeared at the end of 2019 in wuhan city in china. Covid-19 has high ability of transmission from human to another human, and due to its fast spread globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Covid-19 is pandemic disease on March 11, 2020. Several articles have reported many common ENT-related symptoms as an early sign of COVID19. To measure the prevalence of insomnia and dysgeusia in COVID19 patients in Saudi Arabia and investigate their functional and psychological effects on patients. This study evaluated the impact of insomnia and dysgeusia on COVID-19 patients' quality of life using the short version of the Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQODNS) Questionnaire. It was done from 5 June to 30 July 2020, in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. A total of 274 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were participated. The most common ENT-related symptoms were headache 69%, insomnia 65.3%, and dysgeusia 64.6%. Interestingly, insomnia can greatly affect patients' daily life, as around 37.6% of our patients had problems with taking part in daily activities, 42% felt isolated, 68.1% had changes in appetite, 51.4% had more stress, and 28.2% had increased anger secondary to loss of smell. In Addition, 62% (110) of patients who lost their taste declared that their daily activities were affected. ENT-related symptoms are one of the most COVID19 manifestations. The duration of both insomnia and dysgeusia is an important contributing factor on the patients' functional & psychological state as it may prolong their isolation period. Therefore, Otolaryngologists considered the first-line physicians for many of Covid-19 patients, which makes us at higher risk to be infected with Covid-19 too. It is also particularly important for Otolaryngologists to develop a management guideline to reduce the duration and severity of all ENT-related features.

BACKGROUND: Co-infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with respiratory viruses, bacteria and fungi have been reported to cause a wide range of illness., OBJECTIVES: We assess the prevalence of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with seasonal respiratory viruses, document the respiratory viruses detected among individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, and describe characteristics of individuals with respiratory virus co-infection detected., METHODS: Specimens included in this study were submitted as part of routine clinical testing to Public Health Ontario Laboratory from individuals requiring testing for SARS-CoV-2 and/or seasonal respiratory viruses., RESULTS: Co-infection was detected in a smaller proportion (2.5%) of individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 than those with seasonal respiratory viruses (4.3%); this difference was not significant. Individuals with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to be younger than 65 years of age and male than those with single infection. Those with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection manifested mostly mild respiratory symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study may not support routine testing for seasonal respiratory viruses among all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, as they were rare during the study period nor associated with severe disease. However, testing for seasonal respiratory viruses should be performed in severely ill individuals, in which detection of other viruses may assist with patient management.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: Critically ill COVID-19 patients often required mechanical ventilation (MV) support. For ICU nursing staff, COVID-19 patients' management presented a relevant increasing in workload, especially during pronation. In this emergency scenario Clinica Luganese Moncucco, identified as a COVID-19 Center by the Swiss Health Department, decided to introduce a specialized ICU Physiotherapy Team (IPT) to support nursing staff during pronations. Objective(s): Primary outcome was to analyze complications rate in critically ill COVID-19 patients managed by this specialized team during pronations. Secondary outcomes were to analyze all correlations between the incidence of minor complications, like pressure sores, and clinical data to find any potential protective factor. Method(s): A retrospective analysis on consecutive critically ill COVID- 19 patients from March 16th to April 16th, 2020. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of major and minor complications related to pronation performed by the IPT. Result(s): Forty-two patients were treated by specialized IPT. Pronation maneuvers were performed on 81% of patients with 296 pronations, with an average of 3.52 cycles per patient (SD 2.47). The average BMI was 28.3 kg/m2(SD 5.1); 36 (86%) patients were on MV (66% ventilated by OTI and 19% by tracheotomy), with a mean duration of MV days of 10.5 days. The mean age was 65.61 (SD 10.95), 35 (83.3%) were male. The nurse workload was increased, with a median NEMS score of 34.5, compared to previous year (p < 0.001). One major complication (0.3%) identified as a dislocation of endotracheal tube was observed; 14 patients (33.3%) were burdened by minor complications like pressure sores. The number of pressure sores was correlated with ICU LOS (p = 0.001) and MV days (p = 0.001); the presence of pressure sores was also related to ICU LOS (p = 0.029) and MV days (p = 0.015). No other significant correlations were found. To better estimate the effect of the observed data, the propensity score was applied, given the retrospective study design and the imbalance between treatment and pronation number. The propensity match score showed no protective pronation factor regarding the presence of ulcers (1.0, p = 0.448). Conclusion(s): Specific pronation team resulted in a lower rate of major complications. The persistent high amount of minor complications appeared to be related rather to the disease severity than to pronation gesture, suggesting that minor complications were not protected by pronation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Injury to the endothelial glycocalyx in critically ill Covid-19 patients. Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect the endothelium leading to microvascular endothelialitis. The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) plays an essential role in maintaining endothelial function. Objective(s): To investigate if injury to the eGC can be found in critical ill Covid-19 patients Methods: Sublingual assessment of the eGC via sublingual dark field imaging was performed in 19 critically ill Covid-19 patients within 24h after intubation and in 10 controls. Blood samples were analyzed for markers of endothelial and eGC injury. A 3D microfluidic flow assay was performed to examine eGC ex vivo in naive and Heparanase-2 overexpressing endothelial cells (ECs). Result(s): In Covid-19 patients, transmembrane proteins such as Syndecan- 1 and sTie2 were increased in the circulation indicting pathological shedding. Hpa-1, a key regulator of eGC, and its enzymatic activity were unchanged. In contrast, its protective counterpart Hpa-2 was profoundly reduced (median (IQR) 18.7 (10.6-31.1) U/ml vs. 4.7 (2.6-5.6) U/ml, p = 0.014). Ex vivo stimulation of ECs with serum from Covid-19 patients was sufficient to lower Hpa-2 transcription and to induce glycocalyx damage that could be rescued by lentiviral Hpa-2 overexpression. Consistently, in vivo imaging of the eGC revealed a reduced thickness (increased perfused boundary region (PBR) 1.9 (1.8-1.9) mum vs. 2.1 (1.8-2.2)mum, p = 0.009) in Covid-19. Conclusion(s): In critically ill patients with Covid-19, early endothelial injury involves the integrity of the glycocalyx. Acquired Hpa-2 deficiency might be a potentially causative factor. These observations may trigger novel therapeutic interventions aiming at protecting endothelial function.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Short-term psychological outcomes in covid-19 patients following admission to intensive care. Introduction: Studies indicate high rates of psychological morbidity amongst patients following admission in an intensive care unit (ICU), including acute stress disorder which is predictive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[1-3] The recent emergence of covid-19 has had a profound impact on patients, with additional psychological burdens implicated with ICU admission. Objective(s): We aimed to establish the prevalence of acute stress disorder in a single cohort of covid-19 patients discharged from ICU, and to assess which variables could be correlated to their psychological outcomes. Method(s): Data was prospectively collated following local audit approval in a UK district general ICU over a 3 month period between March and May 2020. Patients diagnosed with covid-19, who survived ICU care and were discharged to the ward, were eligible for inclusion. A validated screening questionnaire called the 'Acute Stress Disorder Scale' was used to assess the acute stress disorder score (ASDS), the primary outcome.[4] Variables including APACHE II score; CAM-ICU score; duration of stay and sedation in ICU; insertion of tracheostomy; and receipt of invasive ventilation were recorded. A 'covid-19 score' was formed to observe the impact of covid-19 specifically on a patient's psychological experience of social isolation. Result(s): 75 patients were admitted to ICU, with 22 patients discharged to the ward. 9 patients were included for screening; the other 13 patients eligible for inclusion had been discharged to the community on commencing screening so were unable to participate. The median ASDS score was 39 (IQR 33-54). 3 patients recorded ASDS scores of >=52, which as an independent cut-off score can predict PTSD with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 86% respectively. There was a strong positive correlation between ASDS and duration of stay in ICU and sedation (Table 1). There was a weaker correlation with 'covid-19 scores' and APACHE II scores. 8 patients had documented CAM-ICU scores, with 6 patients screened as positive. Conclusion(s): In this cohort of covid-19 patients, there is a high incidence of acute stress disorder following admission into ICU. There appears to be a strong correlation between ASDS and duration of ICU stay and sedation. No statistical significance can be derived from these data. Further large studies with long-term follow-up are required to assess if acute stress disorder in this cohort of covid-19 patients is statistically linked to PTSD.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Characteristics of COVID-19 in Homeless Shelters : A Community-Based Surveillance Study. BACKGROUND: Homeless shelters are a high-risk setting for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission because of crowding and shared hygiene facilities. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate SARS-CoV-2 case counts across several adult and family homeless shelters in a major metropolitan area. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based surveillance study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917). SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms. INTERVENTION: 2 strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing (\"surge testing\") events. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity. RESULT(S): Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room. LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count. CONCLUSION(S): Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters. The findings suggest an unmet need for routine viral testing outside of clinical settings for homeless populations. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Gates Ventures.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Comparison of 3 risk prediction scores for Covid-19 in a UK hospital. Introduction: As the Covid-19 pandemic has spread around the world, several new scores have been released to predict risk of critical illness or mortality among Covid-19 patients. None of these scores have been validated in the UK population. Objective(s): We attempted to compare 3 scores-COVID-GRAM [1], HNC-LL [2] and CURB-65 scoring systems in assessing accuracy for predicting critical illness or in-patient mortality among Covid-19 patients at our institution. Method(s): We collected data on 429 patients with RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 infection identified from the local ISARIC CCP and hospital databases, admitted during March and April 2020. Our endpoints were 1). Critical illness defined as Deaths and/or ICU admission 2). In-patient mortality. Result(s): The incidence of inpatient mortality and progression to critical illness in our cohort was 32.1% and 38.7% respectively. COVIDGRAM tool showed the highest accuracy in predicting critical illness (AUC 0.647; 95% CI 0.600 to 0.692) and inpatient mortality (AUC 0.695; 95% CI 0.649 to 0.739). There was no significant difference in accuracy of AUC between CURB-65 and COVID-GRAM (p-0.9074) for inpatient mortality but both were better than HNCLL. (p-0.0415 and 0.0112). HNCLL showed lowest accuracy in predicting both the endpoints of interest . Conclusion(s): While COVID-GRAM was most accurate in predicting critical illness and inpatient mortality from COVID 19, it was only marginally higher than CURB65. We recommend the continued use of CURB 65 as convenient and easy to use tool in predicting complications and mortality from COVID 19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Public prophylaxis to decrease the emergence of new daily COVID-19 cases is vital. Adjuvant TaibUVID nutritional supplements are promising home-made or hospital-made supplements suggested for rapidly preventing and treating COVID-19 pandemic. We report here a 44 years old male physician who caught COVID-19 infection at hospital in Egypt with confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Ethical committee approval and informed patient's consent were gained before performing this study. Chest X-ray revealed increased bronchovascular markings. Close follow-up was done with no treatment given and he was sent for home isolation. Few days later, he developed progressive non-productive cough and a sense of difficult breathing with no associated fever or chest pain. An antitussive drug was given to him. The patient read about TaibUVID supplements from social media and started to feel improvement after TaibUVID inhalation therapy (using the heated solution of nigella sativa and chamomile five times a day). He also received a home-made TaibUVID nutritional supplement (nigella sativa, chamomile and natural honey) five times daily for four consecutive days. The next day, he was quite better with mild symptoms. Two days later, nasopharyngeal swab PCR was negative while other patients still had positive nasopharyngeal swabs. As few attacks of mild cough and breathing difficulty existed, he was admitted to hospital. A nasopharyngeal swab PCR was done for him again and the result was negative also. Blood gases were normal. He had lymphocytosis (possibly due to TaibUVID effects) that counteract lymphopenia seen in COVID-19 patients. Biochemical and hematological evaluation were quite normal apart from increased serum chloride and lactate dehydrogenase. There was a mild decrease in serum CO2 and alkaline phosphatase. Chest CT report revealed symmetrically inflated both lungs with non-specific focal nodular infiltrates (scattered in basal and medial lung segments) in left lower lobes with faint ground glass opacities. He was discharged home. Few days later, he was quite improved with no symptoms and returned to his work comfortably. In conclusion, TaibUVID nutritional supplements may be effective in rapidly changing the nasopharyngeal swab PCR from positive to negative. TaibUVID nutritional supplements are advisable as a natural, safe and effective prophylaxis to stop COVID-19 infectiousness, transmission and emergence of new cases. Clinical studies to investigate TaibUVID nutritional benefits are strongly recommended. TaibUVID may be promising and recommended for public prophylaxis to decrease emergence of new COVID-19 cases.

Globally, India has reported the third highest number of COVID-19 cases. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, witnessed a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting in the establishment of isolation facilities named COVID Care Center (CCC). In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients. Older symptomatic patients with comorbidities and a high NLR admitted in an isolation facility must be frequently monitored for prompt identification of clinical progression and referral to higher center for advanced medical care.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Emergency high ligation in a suspected COVID-19 pediatric patient with incarcerated inguinal hernia: A case report. Background: SARS-Cov-2 infects not only adults, but also children, including pediatric surgery patients with acute abdomen. Here, we report a pediatric surgery case with incarcerated inguinal hernia and suspected COVID-19., Case presentation: A 11-month-old male was brought to our emergency department with the main complaint of recurrent yellowish-green vomiting that was experienced from one day before admission. High fever and shortness of breath were also reported. This patient was also suffering from moderate dehydration. Neither history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 nor traveling from any local transmission area were found. However, a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test revealed a positive result. A lump in the left scrotum that persisted during admission was found. Fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement for decompression was performed. Manual reduction was attempted but failed to reduce the lump. Accordingly, we decided to perform an emergency high ligation using tertiary protection regulations, i.e., full personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19. Intraoperatively, we found a small intestine loop trapped in the scrotum and stuck in the inguinal canal. Postoperatively, the baby was continued to be managed as a patient with COVID-19 while waiting for the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results., Discussion: Manual reduction is standard treatment for incarcerated inguinal hernia in children. The successful rate of manual reduction is about 70%, therefore, if the manual reduction fails, an emergency surgery is mandatory.During the COVID-19 pandemic, all medical procedures require clarity of the patient's status including whether infected with COVID-19. Along with proper precautions, great care must be taken during surgery to minimize the risk of cross infection to health workers., Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of cross-transmission from the patient, since children are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. When and wherever possible, surgeons should perform the procedure in the quickest and most effective manner to shorten exposure time with patient and anesthetic aerosols as well as using appropriate PPE.

Minor outcomes included the development of acute pancreatitis and description of propofol metrics. Of the 106 patients that were included, 60 (56.6%) developed hypertriglyceridemia, with a median time to development of 46 hours. A total of five patients had clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis, with one patient having confirmatory imaging. There was no difference in the dose or duration of propofol in patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia compared with those who did not. In the patients who developed hypertriglyceridemia, 35 patients (58.5%) continued receiving propofol for a median duration of 105 hours.

Method(s): We performed an observational cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted for >=48 hours to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for COVID-19 (28 February to 22 April 2020) who were discharged or dead. We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. Result(s): Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral. Community-acquired co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis was uncommon (31/989, 3.1%) and mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 51 hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections, mostly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, were diagnosed in 43 patients (4.7%), with a mean (SD) time from hospital admission to superinfection diagnosis of 10.6 (6.6) days. Overall mortality was 9.8% (97/989). Patients with community-acquired co-infections and hospital-acquired superinfections had worse outcomes. Conclusion(s): Co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis is uncommon. Few patients developed superinfections during hospitalization. These findings are different compared to those of other viral pandemics. As it relates to hospitalized patients with COVID-19, such findings could prove essential in defining the role of empiric antimicrobial therapy or stewardship strategies.Copyright \u00a9 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva using a guanidium based transport medium suitable for RT-PCR diagnostic assays. Background: Upper respiratory samples used to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus may be infectious and present a hazard during transport and testing. A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings., Methods: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT TM (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28degreeC), refrigerated conditions (4degreeC) and at 35degreeC., Results: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log 10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions., Conclusion: eNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, preservation, and processing of clinical samples for RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 not found in pressure injury exudates from COVID-19 patients. Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has become a global health emergency. The transmissibility of the disease is of great interest to healthcare workers and scientists alike. The primary route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, but viral RNA has also been found in feces and body fluids such as urine, serum, and semen. So far, there has been no report on whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the exudates of cutaneous lesions. This study was designed to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the pressure injury exudates in patients with severe COVID-19 infections. Method(s): 46 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU of the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan between February 4 and April 12 developed pressure injuries. 22 patients with pressure injuries had wound exudates. Wound and pharyngeal swabs of the 22 patients were collected and RT-PCRs were conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Result(s): At the time of pressure injury, 5 patients still tested positive by pharyngeal swabs, the rest of the 17 patients tested negative. However, none of the wound exudate swabs from the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that it is rather unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted via pressure injury exudates, but we still recommend standardized personal protective equipment, face shield and an additional pair of gloves when treating pressure injuries.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Few bacterial co-infections but frequent empiric antibiotic use in the early phase of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: results from a multicentre retrospective cohort study in The Netherlands. Background: Knowledge on bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 is crucial to use antibiotics appropriately. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence of bacterial co-infections, antibiotic use and application of antimicrobial stewardship principles in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method(s): We performed a retrospective observational study in four hospitals (1 university, 2 non-university teaching, 1 non-teaching hospital) in the Netherlands from March to May 2020 including consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data on first microbiological investigations obtained at the discretion of the physician and antibiotic use in the first week of hospital admission were collected. Result(s): Twelve (1.2%) of the 925 patients included had a documented bacterial co-infection (75.0% pneumonia) within the first week. Microbiological testing was performed in 749 (81%) patients: sputum cultures in 105 (11.4%), blood cultures in 711 (76.9%), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in 202 (21.8%), and Legionella urinary antigen testing in 199 (21.5%) patients, with clear variation between hospitals. On presentation 556 (60.1%; range 33.3-73.4%) patients received antibiotics for a median duration of 2 days (IQR 1-4). Intravenous to oral switch was performed in 41 of 413 (9.9%) patients who received intravenous treatment >48 h. Mean adherence to the local guideline on empiric antibiotic therapy on day 1 was on average 60.3% (range 45.3%-74.7%). Conclusion(s): On presentation to the hospital bacterial co-infections are rare, while empiric antibiotic use is abundant.

{"text": "Computational Investigation of Increased Virulence and Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being reported worldwide. More specifically, the variants reported in South Africa (501Y.V2) and United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) were found to be more contagious than the wild type. There are also speculations that the variants might evade the host immune responses induced by currently available vaccines and develop resistance to drugs under consideration. The first step of viral infection in COVID-19, occurs through the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with peptidase domain of the human ACE-2 (hACE-2) receptor. So, possibly the mutations in the RBD domain of spike protein in the new variants could modulate the protein-protein interaction with hACE-2 receptor leading to the increased virulence. In this study, we aim to get molecular level understanding into the mechanism behind the increased infection rate due to such mutations in these variants. We have computationally studied the interaction of the spike protein in both wild-type and B.1.1.7 variant with hACE-2 receptor using combined molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. The binding free energies computed using configurations from minimization run and low temperature simulation show that mutant variant of spike protein has increased binding affinity for hACE-2 receptor (i.e. \u0394\u0394G(N501Y,A570D) is in the range \u221220.4 to \u221221.4 kcal/mol)The residue-wise decomposition analysis and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis evidenced that the N501Y mutation has increased interaction between RBD of spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. We have also carried out calculations using density functional theory and the results evidenced the increased interaction between three pairs of residues (TYR449 (spike)-ASP38 (ACE-2), TYR453-HIE34 and TYR501-LYS353) in the variant that could be attributed to its increased virulence. The free energies of wild-type and mutant variants of the spike protein computed from MM-GBSA approach suggests that latter variant is stable by about \u221210.4 kcal/mol when compared to wild type suggesting that it will be retained in the evolution due to increased stability. We demonstrate that with the use of the state-of-the art of computational approaches, we can in advance predict the more virulent nature of variants of SARS-CoV-2 and alert the world health-care system.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Probable delirium is a presenting symptom of COVID-19 in frail, older adults: a cohort study of 322 hospitalised and 535 community-based older adults. BACKGROUND: Frailty, increased vulnerability to physiological stressors, is associated with adverse outcomes. COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, comorbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. SETTING: Admissions to St Thomas' Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. SUBJECTS: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n=322); unscheduled hospital admission between 1 March 2020 and 5 May 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n=535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from 24 March (application launch) to 8 May 2020. METHOD(S): Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. RESULT(S): Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings.

COVID-19 is highly contagious, and there is no effective treatment yet. New treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment success rate of severe and critically ill patients. Increasing evidence has shown that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The artificial-liver blood-purification system (ALS) is expected to improve the outcome of the cytokine storm. In the present study, the levels of cytokines were detected in 12 COVID-19 patients pre- and post-ALS with promising results.

The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b- 9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources.

{"text": "COVID-19 and pediatric asthma: Clinical and management challenges. Asthma is the most frequent chronic condition in childhood and a current concern exists about asthma in the pediatric population and its risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-alpha production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma-obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions. Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease. Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Focus on asthma control, risk stratification, and medication adherence will be essential to allow children with asthma to return safely to school.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 100 million people globally, and continues to undergo genomic evolution. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies. Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development start to lose potency against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against such variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multi-specific DARPin \u00ae therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin \u00ae domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape. Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that both multi-specific DARPin \u00ae therapeutics, ensovibep (MP0420) and MP0423, are highly potent against the new circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant) and the most frequent emerging mutations in the spike protein. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multi-specific DARPin \u00ae antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin \u00ae molecules, suggests ensovibep and MP0423 as superior alternatives to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin \u00ae platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analysed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine-protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1 + CX3CR1 + CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination and, against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred similar protection as ESAT-6. Together our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells towards terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less-differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune-balance in favor of the host. <h4>Importance</h4> Tuberculosis, caused by Mtb, constitutes a global health crisis of massive proportions and the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic is expected to cause a rise in tuberculosis-related deaths. Improved vaccines are therefore needed more than ever, but a lack of knowledge on protective immunity hampers their development. The present study shows that constitutively expressed antigens with high availability drive highly differentiated CD4 T cells with diminished protective capacity, which could be a survival strategy by Mtb to evade T cell immunity against key antigens. We demonstrate that immunisation with such antigens can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining antigen-specific T cells in a state of low differentiation. Future vaccine strategies should therefore explore combinations of multiple highly expressed antigens and we suggest that T cell differentiation could be used as a readily measurable parameter to identify these in both preclinical and clinical studies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection as a global epidemic that is spreading dramatically day to day. Currently, many efforts have been made against COVID-19 through the designing or developing of specific vaccine or drug, worldwide. In this study, we used the bioinformatics approach to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine against COVID-19 based on Spike (S) protein. Here, we employed in silico tools to identify potential T and B cell epitopes from S protein that have the ability to induce cellular and humoral immunity. Then, the peptide sequence of potential T, B cell epitopes and flagellin (as adjuvant molecule) were joined together by suitable linkers to construct of candidate multi-epitope vaccine (MEV). Subsequently, immunological and structural evaluations such as antigenicity, allergenicity, 3D modeling, molecular docking, fast flexibility simulations as well as in silico cloning were performed. Immunological and structural computational data showed that designed MEV potentially has proper capacity for inducing of cellular and humoral immune responses against COVID-19. Based on the preliminary results, in vitro and in vivo experiments are required for validation in the future.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Spontaneous Reporting: Global and National Time-Series Analyses. PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely reported to present stress to medical systems globally and to disrupt the lives of patients and health care practitioners (HCPs). Given that spontaneous reporting heavily relies on both HCPs and patients, an understandable question is whether the stress of the pandemic has diminished spontaneous reporting. Herein, the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events was assessed., METHODS: Spontaneous-report counts from 119 weeks (January 1, 2018, to April 12, 2020) were identified using Pfizer's safety database and were analyzed. Autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to aggregated and disaggregated time series (TSs). Model residuals were charted on individual-value and moving-range charts and exponentially weighted moving-average charts for the identification of statistically unexpected changes associated with the pandemic., FINDINGS: Overall, the reporting of serious adverse events showed no unexpected decline. Total global reporting declined, driven by HCP reporting (of both serious and nonserious events), starting after week 8 of 2020 and exceeding model expectations by week 15 of 2020, suggesting the pandemic as an assignable cause. However, reporting remained within longer-term historical ranges. The TS from Japan was the only national TS that showed a significant decline, and an unusual periodicity related to national holidays. A few countries, notably Taiwan, showed unexpected statistical increases in reporting associated with the pandemic, commencing as early as week 3 of 2020. In the literature, the reporting of adverse drug events was stable. Ancillary findings included prevalent year-end/beginning reporting minima, with more reports from HCPs than from consumers., IMPLICATIONS: Using data from a large-scale and diverse safety database from a pharmaceutical company, a significant global decline in total reporting was detected, driven by HCPs, not consumers, and reports of nonserious events, consistent with the pandemic as an assignable cause, but the reporting remained within long-term ranges, suggesting relative durability. Importantly, the analyses found no unexpected decline in overall reporting of serious events. Future avenues of research include the use of data from large-scale, publicly available spontaneous reporting systems for assessing the generalizability of the present findings and whether they correlate with impaired signal detection, as well as a follow-up analysis of whether the effects on spontaneous reporting abate after the pandemic.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 100 million confirmed human infections, and 2 million more deaths globally since its emergence in the end of 2019. Several studies have shown that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primate models. However, the effect of prior infection on blocking SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not clear. Here, we evaluated the impact of prior infection on protection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in golden hamsters. Our results showed that prior infection provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, but it was not sterizing immunity. The transmission experiment results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was efficiently transmitted from naive hamsters to prior infected hamsters by direct contact and airborne route, but not by indirect contact. Further, the virus was efficiently transmitted from prior infected hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact, but not by airborne route and indirect contact. Surprisingly, the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters by direct contact during a short period of early infection. Taken together, our study demonstrated that prior infected hamsters with good immunity can still be naturally re-infected, and the virus can be transmitted between prior infected hamsters and the naive through different transmission routes, implying the potential possibility of human re-infection and the risk of virus transmission between prior infected population and the healthy. Our study will help to calculate the herd immunity threshold more accurately, make more reasonable public health decisions, formulate an optimized population vaccination program, as well as aid the implementation of appropriate public health and social measures to control COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Estimating the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine after a single dose. A reanalysis of a study of \u2018real-world\u2019 vaccination outcomes from Israel. A distinctive feature of the roll out of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the UK was the decision to delay the timing of the second injection till 12 weeks after the first. The logic behind this is to protect more people sooner and so reduce the total number of severe infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. This decision caused criticism from some quarters due in part to a belief that a single injection may not give adequate immunity. A recent paper based on Israel\u2019s experience of vaccination suggested that a single dose may not provide adequate protection. Here we extract the primary data from the Israeli paper and then estimate the incidence per day for each day after the first injection and also estimate vaccine effectiveness for each day from day 13 to day 24. We used a pooled estimate of the daily incidence rate during days 1 to 12 as the counterfactual estimate of incidence without disease and estimated confidence intervals using Monte Carlo modelling. After initial injection case numbers increased to day 8 before declining to low levels by day 21. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was pretty much 0 at day 14 but then rose to about 90% at day 21 before levelling off. The cause of the initial surge in infection risk is unknown but may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. What our analysis shows is that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to 21 days to achieve this. The early results coming from Israel support the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The first COVID-19 vaccines have recently gained authorization for emergency use. 1,2 At this moment, limited knowledge on duration of immunity and efficacy of these vaccines is available. Data on other coronaviruses after natural infection suggest that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 might be short lived, 3,4 and preliminary evidence indicates waning antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 Here we model the relationship between immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a series of Ad26 vectors encoding stabilized variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in rhesus macaques 6,7,8 and validate the analyses by challenging macaques 6 months after immunization with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate that has been selected for clinical development. We find that Ad26.COV2.S confers durable protection against replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs that is predicted by the levels of S-binding and neutralizing antibodies. These results suggest that Ad26.COV2.S could confer durable protection in humans and that immunological correlates of protection may enable the prediction of durability of protection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent development of effective and safe prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study, we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both models four weeks post three injections with 100 \u03bcg of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses such as 25-50 \u03bcg or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1-biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore, immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the significantly high levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005 candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1-skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Nontraditional Small House Nursing Homes Have Fewer COVID-19 Cases and Deaths. OBJECTIVES: Green House and other small nursing home (NH) models are considered \"nontraditional\" due to their size (10-12 beds), universal caregivers, and other home-like features. They have garnered great interest regarding their potential benefit to limit Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections due to fewer people living, working, visiting, and being admitted to Green House/small NHs, and private rooms and bathrooms, but this assumption has not been tested. If they prove advantageous compared with other NHs, they may constitute an especially promising model as policy makers and providers reinvent NHs post-COVID., DESIGN: This cohort study compared rates of COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 admissions/readmissions, and COVID-19 mortality, among Green House/small NHs with rates in other NHs between January 20, 2020 and July 31, 2020., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All Green House homes that held a skilled nursing license and received Medicaid or Medicare payment were invited to participate; other small NHs that replicate Green House physical design and operational practices were eligible if they had the same licensure and payer sources. Of 57 organizations, 43 (75%) provided complete data, which included 219 NHs. Comparison NHs (referred to as \"traditional NHs\") were up to 5 most geographically proximate NHs within 100 miles that had <50 beds and >=50 beds for which data were available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Because Department of Veterans Affairs organizations are not required to report to CMS, they were not included., METHODS: Rates per 1000 resident days were derived for COVID-19 cases and admissions, and per 100 COVID-19 positive cases for mortality. A log-rank test compared rates between Green House/small NHs and traditional NHs with <50 beds and >=50 beds., RESULTS: Rates of all outcomes were significantly lower in Green House/small NHs than in traditional NHs that had <50 beds and >=50 beds (log-rank test P < .025 for all comparisons). The median (middle value) rates of COVID-19 cases per 1000 resident days were 0 in both Green House/small NHs and NHs <50 beds, while they were 0.06 in NHs >=50 beds; in terms of COVID-19 mortality, the median rates per 100 positive residents were 0 (Green House/small NHs), 10 (<50 beds), and 12.5 (>=50 beds). Differences were most marked in the highest quartile: 25% of Green House/small NHs had COVID-19 case rates per 1000 resident days higher than 0.08, with the corresponding figures for other NHs being 0.15 (<50 beds) and 0.74 (>=50 beds)., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates are less in Green House/small NHs than rates in traditional NHs with <50 and >=50 beds, especially among the higher and extreme values.

{"text": "De novo design of modular and tunable protein biosensors. Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; binding of the analyte of interest drives switching from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-193, we used the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a signal over background of over 50-fold. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Covid-19 clinical expression is pleiomorphic, severity is related to age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and pathophysiology involves aberrant immune activation and lymphopenia. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected during Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from Covid-19 patients and controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and extensively investigated with immunofluorescence, viral RNA extraction and quantification, total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription and q-PCR using specific primers, supernatant cytokines (IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-beta, TGF-beta1 and IL-6), flow cytometry. The effect of M1- versus M2-type or no polarization prior to infection was assessed., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected monocytes and MDMs but their infection is abortive. Infection was associated with immunoregulatory cytokines secretion and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In vitro polarization did not account for permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1- and M2-type MDMs were similarly infected. In Covid-19 patients, monocytes exhibited lower counts affecting all subsets, decreased expression of HLA-DR, and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of severity., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 drives monocytes and macrophages to induce host immunoparalysis for the benefit of Covid-19 progression.

Background: Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. Method(s): This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. Result(s): Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave. Less physical exercise, low perceived social support, and a dysfunctional family were found to negatively impact psychological symptoms.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) particularly in mechanically ventilated adults with severe pneumonia. The extremely high prevalence of DVT in the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been established between 25 and 84% based on studies including systematic duplex ultrasound of the lower limbs when prophylactic anticoagulation was systematically administrated. DVT prevalence has been shown to be markedly higher than in mechanically ventilated influenza patients (6-8%). Unusually high inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype represents a striking feature of COVID-19 patients, as reflected by markedly elevated reactive protein C, fibrinogen, interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII. Moreover, in critically ill patients, venous stasis has been associated with the prothrombotic phenotype attributed to COVID-19, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Venous stasis results among others from immobilization under muscular paralysis, mechanical ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, and pulmonary microvascular network injuries or occlusions. Venous return to the heart is subsequently decreased with increase in central and peripheral venous pressures, marked proximal and distal veins dilation, and drops in venous blood flow velocities, leading to a spontaneous contrast \"sludge pattern\" in veins considered as prothrombotic.

It is challenging to discriminate between isolated COVID-19 viral and extra bacterial or fungal infection and there is paucity of data, mainly in critically ill patients (1). We investigated the secondary infection rate in COVID-19 critically ill patients, risk factors for infection and mortality. Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) of the Hospital Universitario La Paz (Madrid, Spain), a 1300-bed teaching hospital, between 16 March 2020 and 17 May 2020. In that period a total of 3002 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, and our unit had a total of 83 beds during the pandemic period. All patients that needed invasive mechanical ventilation were included. We recorded patient demographic data, microbiology data and incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay, including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial bacteremia (primary and secondary), according to Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. A total of 107 patients with a mean age 62.210.6 years were included. Incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay was 43.0% (46 patients), including nosocomial bacteremia (32.1%, 34 patients) and VAP (32.7%, 35 patients). Result(s): In univariate analysis, age and coronary arterial disease were related to development of secondary infection. Age remained as an independent predictor of secondary infection in multivariate analysis (OR 1.053, 95% CI 1.010-1.098, p = 0.015). Nor the use of systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab was related to secondary infection. Overall hospital mortality by 30 June 2020 was 68.2%. Mortality was higher in older patients (mean age 65.0 8.1 vs. 56.112.8 years, p = 0.001), in patients infected by antimicrobial resistant pathogens (94.1% vs. 63.3%, p = 0.012) and in case of secondary infection (82.6% vs. 57.3%, p = 0.006). Corticosteroids and tocilizumab administration was not related to mortality. Age and infection by antimicrobial resistant pathogens were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analyses (OR = 1.091, 95% CI 1.039-1.145, p < 0.001; and OR = 8.742, 95% CI 1.069-71.485, p = 0.043, respectively). The incidence of secondary infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients in our study is high (43.9%), higher than reported by Ferrando et al (4), with and incidence of respiratory bacterial infection and bacteremia of 27.15% and 26.24%, respectively, and Yang et al (5) (incidence of pneumonia and bacteremia of 11.5% and 2%, respectively). Feng et al declared an incidence of secondary infection of 34.4% in the more severe subgroup of COVID-19 patients (6). Our cohort includes only patients under invasive mechanical ventilation, what may explain partially these differences. An important finding of our study is the lack of relationship of corticosteroids and tocilizumab use and development of infections and mortality, in contrast to findings published by Sommers et al, with a lower mortality rate but a higher infection occurrence with tocilizumab use (10). Ferrando et al also showed no association between corticoids and tocilizumab use and mortality (4). To our knowledge, this is the first study that focus on secondary nosocomial infections in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our study has several limitations: the retrospective nature of the analysis; the lack of invasive modalities to help diagnose VAP (bronchoalveolar lavage) due to infection control measures; and the absence of data regarding antibiotic treatment since appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment affects mortality. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our data suggest that the incidence of secondary infection is very high in critically-ill patients with COVID-19. Infections by antimicrobial resistant pathogens may have a significant impact in prognosis. We cannot rule out that infections by resistant pathogens was simply a marker of severity. Further studies on larger populations are needed to investigate secondary infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Emergence of SARS CoV-2 causing COVID-19 provoked the need to gather information on the overall outcomes and potential risks associated with morbidity and mortality in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with COVID-19 infections. The COViMS registry was initiated as a rapid and efficient means to collect this data from North American health care providers. Objective(s): To describe the spectrum of outcomes in SARS CoV-2 infected North American MS patients and to ascertain characteristics associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Method(s): The COViMS registry requested that MS, neuromyelitis optica (NMO), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD), and radiographically isolated syndrome (RIS) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection be reported after the outcome was reasonably certain. Data were de-identified and crosssectional. Effort was made to harmonize with other international registries for COVID-19. Poor clinical outcomes assessed were: mortality, mortality and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality, ICU admission and/or hospitalization. Associations between patient characteristics and these outcomes were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Covariates included sex, age, race, smoking, MS clinical course (relapsing, progressive), MS disease duration, ambulation (fully ambulatory, walks with assistance, non-ambulatory), individual comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity), and disease modifying therapy (DMT) use. Result(s): As of Aug 3, 2020, 764 patients from over 140 different practices were reported; 734 MS, 21 NMO, 4 MOGAD, and 5 RIS. MS patients were 73.4% female (73.4%), 65.2% Caucasian, with mean (SD) age of 48.2 (+/-13.5) years. Mean disease duration was 13.8 (+/-9.9) years. 70.9% were fully ambulatory. Ocrelizumab and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) were the top two DMTs used. Most (77.1%) were laboratory confirmed for SARS-CoV-2. Of MS cases, 6.1% died, 13.8% were admitted to the ICU and/or died, and 31.2% were either hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or died. Older age, non-ambulatory status and cardiovascular disease were associated with increased risk of poor outcomes. No specific DMT was associated with increased odds of mortality and mortality and/or ICU admission. Anti-CD20 DMT use showed an increased odds of mortality, ICU admission and/or hospitalization compared to DMF (OR: 2.53 95%CI [1.17, 5.50]). Conclusion(s): The data provide reassurance that the MS registry population aligns with reported COVID-19 outcomes in the general North American population. While reported deaths are few, no clear association between a specific therapy and mortality has been seen after adjustment for age, sex, ambulatory status and comorbidities.

All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively., OUTCOMES: Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers., INTERPRETATION: This study identified a mental health strain represented by parenting a child who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further EB research is needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and related psychiatric symptoms in caregivers of COVID-19 infected children during the next phases of the pandemic.

{"text": "Knowledge, attitudes, practices, and influencing factors of anxiety among pregnant women in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Prenatal anxiety has been a significant public health issue globally, leading to adverse health outcomes for mothers and children. The study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and anxiety level of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan and investigate the influencing factors for prenatal anxiety in this specific context., METHODS: Pregnant subjects' KAP towards COVID-19 and their sociodemographics and pregnancy information were collected using questionnaires. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: The prenatal anxiety prevalence in this population was 20.8%. The mean score of knowledge was 13.2 +/- 1.1 on a 0 ~ 14 scale. The attitudes and practices data showed that 580/ 817 (71.0%) were very concerned about the news of COVID-19, 455/817 (55.7%) considered the official media to be the most reliable information source for COVID-19, and 681/817 (83.4%) were anxious about the possibility of being infected by COVID-19. However, only 83/817 (10.2%) worried about contracting COVID-19 infection through the ultrasound transducer during a routing morphology scan. About two-thirds 528/817 (64.6%) delayed or canceled the antenatal visits. Approximately half of them 410/817 (50.2%) used two kinds of personal protection equipments (PPEs) during hospital visits. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the influential factors for prenatal anxiety included previous children in the family, knowledge score, media trust, worry of contracting the COVID-19 infection and worry about getting infected with COVID-19 from the ultrasound probe antenatal care (ANC) schedule., CONCLUSION: Prenatal anxiety was prevalent among pregnant women in Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19. The current findings identified factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety that could be targeted for psychological care.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is rapidly becoming an established consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 patients though there is a need to critically review this area for proof of efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are considered to play main role in viral clearance. CP infusion may also help in the modulation of immune response by its immunomodulatory effect. The FDA allows for administration of CP to COVID-19 patients. The present published literature in COVID-19 is limited to case series and randomised controlled trial where plasma therapy was used in moderate, severe and critically ill patients.

{"text": "Biochemical features and mutations of key proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and their impacts on RNA therapeutics. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. Three viral proteins, the spike protein (S) for attachment of virus to host cells, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro) for digestion of viral polyproteins to functional proteins, and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) for RNA synthesis are the most critical proteins for virus infection and replication, rendering them the most important drug targets for both antibody and chemical drugs. Due to its low-fidelity polymerase, the virus is subject to frequent mutations. To date, the sequence data from tens of thousands of virus isolates have revealed hundreds of mutations. Although most mutations have a minimum consequence, a small number of non-synonymous mutations may alter the virulence and antigenicity of the mutants. To evaluate the effects of viral mutations on drug safety and efficacy, we reviewed the biochemical features of the three main proteins and their potentials as drug targets, and analyzed the mutation profiles and their impacts on RNA therapeutics. We believe that monitoring and predicting mutation-introduced protein conformational changes in the three key viral proteins and evaluating their binding affinities and enzymatic activities with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated drugs by using computational modeling and machine learning processes can provide valuable information for the consideration of drug efficacy and drug safety for drug developers and drug reviewers. Finally, we propose an interactive database for drug developers and reviewers to use in evaluating the safety and efficacy of U.S. FDA regulated drugs with regard to viral mutations.

In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 occurred in China. Since then, the virus has spread to nearly all countries and infected more than 1 million of people. World Health Organization has declared a pandemic because of the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 epidemic is a third one caused by coronaviruses, the first two being severe acute respiratory syndrome of 2002-2003 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome. In the present review, we briefly summarize information related to COVID-19. We review factors of innate and adaptive immune defense against epidemia-causing coronaviruses as well as mechanisms of viral evasion from the immune response. We also review potential mechanisms underlying the main feature of severe coronavirus infections, namely excudative pneumonia that, in a significant proportion of patients, develops into interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

PURPOSE: Our purpose was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of all existing literature regarding imaging findings on chest CT and associated clinical features in pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19., MATERIALS & METHODS: A literature search was conducted on April 21, 2020 and updated on July 24, 2020 using PubMed, Embase, World Health Organization, and Google Scholar databases. Only studies which described chest CT findings of COVID-19 in pregnant patients were included for analysis., RESULTS: A total of 67 articles and 427 pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. The most frequently encountered pulmonary findings on chest CT were ground-glass opacities (77.2%, 250/324), posterior lung involvement (72.5%, 50/69), multilobar involvement (71.8%, 239/333), bilateral lung involvement (69.4%, 231/333), peripheral distribution (68.1%, 98/144), and consolidation (40.9%, 94/230). Pregnant patients were also found to present more frequently with consolidation (40.9% vs. 21.0-31.8%) and pleural effusion (30.0% vs. 5.0%) in comparison to the general population. Associated clinical features included antepartum fever (198 cases), lymphopenia (128 cases), and neutrophilia (97 cases). Of the 251 neonates delivered, 96.8% had negative RT-PCR and/or IgG antibody testing for COVID-19. In the eight cases (3.2%) of reported neonatal infection, tests were either conducted on samples collected up to 72 h after birth or were found negative on all subsequent RT-PCR tests., CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients appear to present more commonly with more advanced COVID-19 CT findings compared to the general adult population. Furthermore, characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in pregnant patients tended to mirror those found in the general patient population. Lastly, results from neonatal testing suggest a low risk of vertical transmission. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: The rapidly spreading Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) appeared to be a highly transmissible pathogen in healthcare environments and had resulted in a significant number of patients with respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, an aerosol-generating procedure that places healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the infection. Instead of deferring or delaying the procedure, we developed and implemented a novel percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) protocol aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission while maintaining favorable procedural outcome. Patients and Methods. All patients who underwent PDT per novel protocol were included in the study. The key element of the protocol was the use of apnea during the critical part of the insertion and upon any opening of the ventilator circuit. This was coupled with the use of enhanced personnel protection equipment (PPE) with a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The operators underwent antibody serology testing and were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms two weeks from the last procedure included in the study., Results: Between March 12th and June 30th, 2020, a total of 32 patients underwent PDT per novel protocol. The majority (80%) were positive for COVID-19 at the time of the procedure. The success rate was 94%. Only one patient developed minor self-limited bleeding. None of the proceduralists developed positive serology or any symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection., Conclusion: A novel protocol that uses periods of apnea during opening of the ventilator circuit along with PAPR-enhanced PPE for PDT on COVID-19 patients appears to be effective and safe for patients and healthcare providers.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the pandemic human respiratory illness COVID-19, is a global health emergency. While severe acute disease has been linked to an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, we sought to identify B cell responses that correlated with positive clinical outcomes in convalescent patients. We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects. Memory B cell subsets in convalescent subjects were composed of classical CD24+ class-switched memory B cells, but also activated CD24-negative and natural unswitched CD27+ IgD+ IgM+ subsets. Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in most seropositive subjects. IgM+ memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over 3 months.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Point of Care (POC) tests have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. They need to be easily usable by the general population in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO R POC test and the results were recently published. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by the general public in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use., METHODS: 143 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plant workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use, with or without a tutorial video, were made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users' ability to read the results., RESULTS: 88.4% of the test users judged the instructions for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3% of the users obtained a valid result and, according to the supervisors, 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the users. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback on the COVID PRESTO R as a potential self-test. Neither age nor education had an influence., CONCLUSION: COVID-PRESTO R was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its use was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population.

{"text": "An indirect method to monitor the fraction of people ever infected with COVID-19: An application to the United States. The number of COVID-19 infections is key for accurately monitoring the pandemics. However, due to differential testing policies, asymptomatic individuals and limited large-scale testing availability, it is challenging to detect all cases. Seroprevalence studies aim to address this gap by retrospectively assessing the number of infections, but they can be expensive and time-intensive, limiting their use to specific population subgroups. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR) in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because they count with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. We obtain that the IFR varies from 1.25% (0.39-2.16%, 90% CI) in Florida, the most aged population, to 0.69% in Utah (0.21-1.30%, 90% CI), the youngest population. By September 8, 2020, we estimate that at least five states have already a fraction of people ever infected between 10% and 20% (New Jersey, New York, Massachussets, Connecticut, and District of Columbia). The state with the highest estimated fraction of people ever infected is New Jersey with 17.3% (10.0, 55.8, 90% CI). Moreover, our results indicate that with a probability of 90 percent the fraction of detected people among the ever infected since the beginning of the epidemic has been less than 50% in 15 out of the 20 states analyzed in this paper. Our approach can be a valuable tool that complements seroprevalence studies and indicates how efficient have testing policies been since the beginning of the outbreak.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Prevalence of COVID infections in a population of rheumatic patients from Lombardy and Marche treated with biological drugs or small molecules: A multicentre retrospective study. Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the management of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for rheumatic conditions. It is well known that rheumatic patients are at risk of developing infections because of their immunocompromised state. Moreover, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab that are widely used to treat rheumatic diseases are now being used to treat COVID-19. The aim of this multicentre retrospective study of rheumatic patients in the Italian regions of Lombardy and Marche was to determine whether patients receiving biological or small molecules treatment are more susceptible to the development of COVID-19 than the general population. Methods: The local registry data of 10,260 rheumatic patients being treated with bDMARDs or small molecules were evaluated from 15 March to 23 April 2020. The final analysis was based on the registry data relating to 7.204, telephone contacts and/or outpatient visits. Results: Forty-seven of the 7.204 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, seven of whom died; the patients who had symptoms resembling those of COVID-19 but had negative swabs were considered negative for the disease. The overall infection rate was 0.65, and the crude case fatality risk (CFR) in the patients with COVID-19 was 14.9%. There was no difference in the mortality rate among the patients receiving the different individual biological drugs or small molecules. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the susceptibility of rheumatic patients to COVID-19 is the same as that of the general population, but confirm that age, disease duration, and the number of co-morbidities are associated with an increased risk of a severe form of the disease. It seems that immunosuppressants drugs do not effectively represent a risk factor for COVID19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies., RESULTS: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19's impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM)., CONCLUSIONS: Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

{"text": "Deep vein thrombosis screening of COVID-19 patients in intensive care. Introduction: Patients infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications as demonstrated in autopsy findings(Wichmann et al) and observational clinical studies(Helms et al). Recognising this increased risk, our intensive care unit started a screening programme using compression ultrasound to detect venous thrombosis. Method(s): From 1st April 2020, any patient admitted to our adult intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 underwent compression ultrasound of the external iliac veins to popliteal trifurcation and the internal jugular veins. This scan was carried out shortly after admission to ICU and repeated weekly until ICU discharge. Scans were performed by medical staff trained in compression ultrasound. Any scans felt to demonstrate thrombus meriting anticoagulation were reviewed by a senior clinician with experience in compression ultrasound. Any doubt or disagreement prompted further assessment by a radiologist or sonographer. Result(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were cared for in ICU during this project. The demographics are summarised below. Fifteen patients (68.2%) were found to have thrombus of varying severity on compression ultrasound. Eight were judged to merit treatment with anticoagulation. Of the eight patients that were anticoagulated, 7 were diagnosed on compression ultrasound screening. Five were found to have lower limb DVTs, 2 of which were bilateral. Two patients had occlusive thrombus in an internal jugular vein. One patient was anticoagulated following thrombolysis for a clinical diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolus. Patients with proximal femoral vein DVTs were treated in the prone position more times (median 5 [4-6]) than those without (median 2 [1-5]). They were also more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (median 32 [31-36] vs 27.5 [25-36]). Eight patients had non-occlusive thrombus in an internal jugular vein, not considered large enough to merit systemic anticoagulation and all were associated with central venous catheters sites. Five patients underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA), all of which were negative. Two patients suffered bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy, one developed minor haematuria and one life threatening spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage requiring embolisation. Conclusion(s): Given the recognised risk of thromboembolic complications in critically unwell COVID-19 patients, the higher prevalence of severe disease in obese patients(Simonnet et al, Caussy et al) and the frequent use of prone position ventilation, we feel that DVT screening merits consideration as a routine part of the care of these patients. Compression ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive bedside investigation that uses existing technology that is familiar to critical care staff.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Perspective on therapeutic and diagnostic potential of camel nanobodies for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). In this paper, we focus on the camelid nanobodies as a revolutionary therapy that can guide efforts to discover new drugs for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The small size property makes nanobodies capable of penetrating efficiently into tissues and recognizing cryptic antigens. Strong antigen affinity and stability in the gastrointestinal tract allow them to be used via oral administration. In fact, the use of nanobodies as inhalant can be directly delivered to the target organ, conferring high pulmonary drug concentrations and low systemic drug concentrations and minimal systemic side effects. For that, nanobodies are referred as a class of next-generation antibodies. Nanobodies permit the construction of multivalent formats that may achieve ultra-high neutralization potency and then may prevent mutational escape and can neutralize a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to their distinctive characteristics, nanobodies can be of great use in the development of promising treatment or preventive strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, the state-of-the-art of camel nanobodies design strategies against the virus including SARS-CoV-2 are critically summarized. The application of general nanotechnology was also discussed to mitigate and control emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection.

{"text": "Multiplexed detection and quantification of human antibody response to COVID-19 infection using a plasmon enhanced biosensor platform. The 2019 SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has illustrated the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests. In this work, a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) biosensor platform was used to rapidly and accurately measure antibodies against COVID-19 in human blood serum and dried blood spot samples. The GC-FP platform measures antibody-antigen binding interactions for multiple targets in a single sample, and has 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The GC-FP platform yielded a quantitative, linear response for serum samples diluted to as low as 1:1600 dilution. Test results were highly correlated with two commercial COVID-19 antibody tests, including an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay. To demonstrate test efficacy with other sample matrices, dried blood spot samples (n = 63) were obtained and evaluated with GC-FP, yielding 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection. The test was also evaluated for detection of multiple immunoglobulin isotypes, with successful detection of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody-antigen interactions. Last, a machine learning approach was developed to accurately score patient samples for prior COVID-19 infection, using antibody binding data for all three COVID-19 antigens used in the test.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Epidemiological pattern, incidence, and outcomes of COVID-19 in liver transplant patients. Background & Aims: The incidence and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in immunocompromised patients are a matter of debate. Methods: We performed a prospective nationwide study including a consecutive cohort of liver transplant patients with COVID-19 recruited during the Spanish outbreak from 28 February to 7 April, 2020. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and/or death. Age- and gender-standardised incidence and mortality ratios (SIR and SMR) were calculated using data from the Ministry of Health and the Spanish liver transplant registry. Independent predictors of severe COVID-19 among hospitalised patients were analysed using multivariate Cox regression. Results: A total of 111 liver transplant patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (SIR = 191.2 [95% CI 190.3-192.2]). The epidemiological curve and geographic distribution overlapped widely between the liver transplant and general populations. After a median follow-up of 23 days, 96 patients (86.5%) were admitted to hospital and 22 patients (19.8%) required respiratory support. A total of 12 patients were admitted to the ICU (10.8%). The mortality rate was 18%, which was lower than in the matched general population (SMR = 95.5 [95% CI 94.2-96.8]). Overall, 35 patients (31.5%) met criteria of severe COVID-19. Baseline immunosuppression containing mycophenolate was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 (relative risk = 3.94; 95% CI 1.59-9.74; p = 0.003), particularly at doses higher than 1,000 mg/day (p = 0.003). This deleterious effect was not observed with calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus and complete immunosuppression withdrawal showed no benefit. Conclusions: Being chronically immunosuppressed, liver transplant patients have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 but their mortality rates are lower than the matched general population. Upon hospital admission, mycophenolate dose reduction or withdrawal could help in preventing severe COVID-19. However, complete immunosuppression withdrawal should be discouraged. Lay summary: In liver transplant patients, chronic immunosuppression increases the risk of acquiring COVID-19 but it could reduce disease severity. Complete immunosuppression withdrawal may not be justified. However, mycophenolate withdrawal or temporary conversion to calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus until disease resolution could be beneficial in hospitalised patients.

Objectives: : The implementation of social confinement measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has limited the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their transmission. This study aims to explore the epidemiological behaviour of two notifiable STDs during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba., Study design: This is an exploratory study of the incidence rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba., Methods: This study compares national weekly surveillance data on syphilis and gonorrhoea incidence rates in Cuba with the timeline of implemented social confinement measures., Results: Incidence rates for both STDs were declining before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Cuba. Following the confirmation of COVID-19 in Cuba and the implementation of social confinement measures, the decreasing incidence rates of syphilis and gonorrhoea continued. When social measures were subsequently relaxed, there was an increase in the incidence of syphilis, but incidence levels of gonorrhoea remained at a plateau., Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the social measures introduced to curb the spread of COVID-19 influenced the sexual risk behaviours of individuals and subsequently modified the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea. It is necessary to continue epidemiological surveillance for longer periods of time and to explore it at the local, regional and national levels to better understand STDs in times of COVID-19.

{"text": "Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age. Because the impact of immunosuppression on disease severity is not entirely clear, management of patients under immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial. Six cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with COVID-19 on immunosuppressive medication are presented. The aim of this study was to describe patients' clinical manifestation and chronologic development of virus-specific antibodies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection before and after restart with immunosuppressive/biological therapy as an indicator for a specific immune response. All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients. Late antibody development seems to be more frequent in older patients and in patients with combined immunosuppressive treatment. In this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could be useful prior to restarting immunosuppressive therapy. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol improves the respiratory outcomes as compared with placebo among adults COVID-19 patients at moderate risk of clinical complications., TRIAL DESIGN: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the effects on clinical outcomes., PARTICIPANTS: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection by RT-PCR; Hospital admission at least 24 hours before; Expected hospitalization in the same site >=24 hours; Oxygen saturation >=90% (measured by pulse oximetry) breathing ambient air; Age >=45 years or at least one of the following conditions:  Hypertension;  Diabetes;  At least moderate COPD or asthma;  Cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery);  Body mass index >=30; Willingness to sign informed consent (online supplementary material 1 and 2)., EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Age <18 years; Women in childbearing age; >= 72 hs since current admission; Requirement for a high dose of oxygen (>5 litres/minute) or mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive); History of chronic kidney disease requiring haemodialysis or chronic liver failure; Inability for oral intake.

The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2) and FiO2 (27, 28) is used instead of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). SOFAr score is a 4-points scale, with higher values indicating deeper respiratory derangement as follows: 1 PaO2 <400; 2 PaO2 <300; 3 PaO2 <200; 4 PaO2 <100. The primary outcome for the second stage is the combined occurrence of requirement >=40% of FiO2, invasive or non-invasive ventilation, up to 30 days or hospital discharge., RANDOMISATION: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the electronic data capture system (Castor R). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes (yes/no), age (<=60/>60 years) and the site., BLINDING (MASKING): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to complete individual treatment.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time., PURPOSE: The objectives and strategies used by an ambulatory care pharmacy team operating within a large health system's pharmacy incident command structure during the initial response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are discussed., SUMMARY: In a time of crisis, a pharmacy \"ambulatory action team\" was formed to provide ambulatory clinical pharmacy expertise and meet an immediate and ongoing need to limit nonemergent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. By building a strong communication infrastructure and partnership with ambulatory care providers, clinic medical and operational leaderships, clinical laboratory staff, and infusion centers, the team was able to swiftly execute solutions and respond to new issues and requests. Ambulatory care pharmacy practice continued to advance through provision of services to vulnerable patient populations with chronic conditions that were anticipated to experience gaps in care management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts resulted in expansion of pharmacists' involvement in collaborative drug therapy management, support of patients' transition from in-clinic injection to home self-administration, provision of medication assistance support, and management of 1,300 patients via protocol-based warfarin management. Additionally, ambulatory pharmacy services in 15 primary care, anticoagulation, and specialty clinic sites were transitioned to telehealth. The ambulatory action team also implemented several strategies to manage medication therapy associated with COVID-19-related shortages and implemented electronic decision support to guide prescribing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin., CONCLUSION: Building a strong communication infrastructure and a pharmacy ambulatory action team were essential to respond to a crisis and continue ambulatory clinical pharmacy services expansion.

Objective: To compare the incidence and clinical features of individuals presenting in emergency rooms (ER) with facial palsy during the Italian COVID-19 outbreak and in the same period of 2019. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for all accesses to the six ER in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (27 February-3 May 2020) to identify all cases of diagnosed facial palsy. Clinical information was retrieved for each patient and compared with that of facial palsy cases presenting in 2019. Result(s): Between 27 February and 3 May 2020, 38 patients presented to provincial ERs for facial palsy; in 2019, there were 22 cases, for an incidence rate ratio of 1.73 (95% CI 1.02-2.92) for the 2020 cohort. Of the 2020 cohort, eight patients (21%) presented with active or recent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, compared with 2 (9%) in 2019 (p =.299); one was tested and resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, patients were younger (-11 years, p =.037) than those of the previous year and manifested a longer lag (+1.1 days, p =.001) between symptoms onset and ER presentation. Conclusion(s): We observed a higher occurrence of facial palsy during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the same period of the previous year; 21% of patients presenting with facial palsy had active or recent symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an excess risk of facial palsy during or after COVID-19.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain., OBJECTIVE: Objective: To conduct a double-blind, parallel arm, single cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Methods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported non-malignant low back pain > 6 months duration and with average pain intensity > 4/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of two daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework., RESULTS: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 77%; Caucasian: 91%; at least some college education: 92%; mean age: 51.5 years, SD=13.1; average pain intensity: 5/10, SD=1.2; back pain duration >5 years: 67%). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx vs. Sham VR (p<0.0001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest p-value = .0090), and between-groups Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17-1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group vs. the Sham VR group (p=0.0224 and p=.0132, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent; MME) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (p<0.01) but not for ShamVR., CONCLUSIONS: EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects.

OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious health crisis facing the modern world; hospital admissions have risen dramatically. Urticaria is characterized by itchy edematous papules/ plaques, angioedema and involvement of one or both of the deep dermis or subcutis. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of acute and chronic urticaria, the proportions of urticaria patients among all dermatology patients before and after the onset of the pandemic, and age and sex characteristics. Materials and Methods MATERIALS AND METHODS: 57 Patients diagnosed with urticaria before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 and January and February 2020 at the Dermatology Polyclinic of Beysehir State Hospital, and 25 patients diagnosed within 3 months(March,April,May 2020) after the onset of the pandemic, were included. We retrospectively recorded age, sex, and the duration of the disease. Patients were divided into those with acute and chronic urticaria using the EAACI / GA (2) / LEN / EDF / WAO guidelines and data obtained before and after the onset of the pandemic were compared., RESULTS: Fifty-one (62.2%) patients were female and the mean patient age was 40.88 +/- 17.38 years. We found no significant difference in the mean age or sex distribution before and after the onset of the pandemic (P = 0.341) (P = 0.604). The proportion of urticaria patients (1.6%) among all dermatology patients treated in a 3-month period after the onset of the pandemic was higher than that before the pandemic (1.19%) (P < 0.001). During the pandemic, the acute urticaria rate was significantly higher than before the pandemic (P = 0.002)., CONCLUSION: The urticaria rate (particularly that of acute disease) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Correlation between SARS-COV-2 antibody screening by immunoassay and neutralizing antibody testing. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP), an alternative for the treatment of COVID-19, depends on high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), but assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of CP donors., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 214 CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) using two commercial immunoassays: EUROIMMUN (ELISA) and Abbott (Chemiluminescence). Quantification of nAbs was performed using the Cytopathic Effect-based Virus Neutralization test. Three criteria for identifying donors with nAbs >= 1:160 were tested: - C1: Curve ROC; - C2: Conditional decision tree considering only the IA results and - C3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables., RESULTS: The performance of the immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers >=1:160. Regarding the studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers: (a) C1 showed 76.1% accuracy if S/CO = 4.65, (b) C2 presented 76.1% accuracy if S/CO >=4.57 and (c) C3 had 71.6% accuracy if S/CO was >=4.57 or if S/CO was between 2.68-4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms were recent (within 19 days)., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs titers.

The presented work contains the analysis of a virus-specific antibody frequency in patients with COVID-19, the timing of their appearance and the kinetics of seroconversion. It was found that total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were detected in 55.7 % and IgG - in 74.7 % of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Their frequency was significantly higher than that in patients of the other examined groups. During the first 6 days, the kinetics of seroconversion was characterized by the appearance of total antibodies and IgG in 10.5 and 5.3 % of patients with COVID-19, respectively. In most patients (71.4 %), seroconversion of IgM and IgG was registered from 7 to 11 days and 100 % of patients had total antibodies and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 after 22 days of disease.

{"text": "Experience of ultrasound application in diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia. Purpose. To assess the possibilities of using the ultrasound method in detecting signs of pneumonia associated with COVID-19. Material and methods. The experience of using ultrasound lungs examination of 75 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Ultrasound studies were carried out on a portable device Mindray DC-6900 (China) using linear transducers at a frequency of 5.0-15 MHz and convex transducers at a frequency of 3.5-5.0 MHz. The method of ultrasound examination of the chest organs provided for a sequential examination and assessment of twelve conventional scanning zones. The presence of artifacts of the ultrasound image along the horizontal (A-line) and confluent vertical (B-lines) scanning lines was studied. Results. Ultrasound examination of the lungs of 75 patients with COVID-19 revealed vertical artifacts of the ultrasound image. Focal or confluent B-lines (49,3% patients), as well as thickening and compaction of the pleural line (44% patients), subpleural consolidations in the form of hypoechoic areas under the pleural line (34,7% patients). Pleural effusions were found in 3 (4%) cases. In 35 (46,7%) patients with a mild course of the disease and an asymptomatic form, according to the ultrasound examination, horizontal A-lines were identified, which indicated the preservation of the airiness of the lungs. Discussion. The main ultrasound diagnostic criteria for pneumonia caused by SARSCoV-2 is the absence of horizontal A-lines and the appearance of vertical B-lines. Subpleural consolidations and changes in the pleural line served as additional ultrasound signs. Ultrasound signs and the number of affected areas correlated with the severity of the disease. False negative results were associated with deep-seated consolidations or shielding by scapulae and ribs. Significant difficulties in imaging the chest organs have arisen in obese patients. In these cases, the data of ultrasound studies in combination with X-ray and CT scan facilitated a more precise diagnosis of the course of the disease. Conclusion. Ultrasound examination is one of the available methods in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of the disease and can be used more widely in clinical practice..Copyright \u00a9 2020 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

{"text": "Racial and geographic disparities in influenza vaccination in the U.S. among individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Renewed importance in the setting of COVID-19. Introduction: The importance of receiving an annual influenza vaccine among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. With the rapid community spread and the possibility of another wave of COVID-19 infections in the fall, receiving an influenza vaccine is of particular importance to mitigate the risk associated with overlapping influenza and COVID-19 infections., Methods: We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2016 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationally representative U.S. telephone-based survey of adults 18 years or older. Race/ethnicity was our exposure of interest. We assessed the relative difference in influenza vaccination by race/ethnicity for each U.S. state in the overall U.S. population and among those with ASCVD as prevalence of receipt of influenza vaccination among Blacks or Hispanics minus prevalence among Whites divided by prevalence among Whites. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to evaluate the association between socioeconomic risk factors and receipt of influenza vaccination., Results: The study population consisted of 1,747,397 participants of whom 21% were older than 65 years, 51% women, 63% White, 12% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 9% with history of ASCVD. The receipt of influenza vaccine was 38% in the overall population and 51% among those with self-reported ASCVD, which translates to approximately to 97 million and 12 million US adults, respectively. The receipt of influenza vaccine among individuals with ASCVD was 54% for Whites, 45% for Blacks, and 42% for Hispanics (p<0.001). In the overall U.S. population, the median (interquartile range) relative difference for influenza vaccination between Blacks and Whites was 17% (-27%, -9%) and -22% (-29%, -9%) between Hispanics and Whites across all U.S. states. Among individuals with and without ASCVD, age older than 65 years, greater than college education, higher income, and having a primary care physician were significantly associated with higher odds of receipt of influenza vaccination, while being employed, lack of healthcare coverage, Black race, and delay in healthcare access were significantly inversely associated with having received an influenza vaccine., Conclusions: Only 50% patients with ASCVD receive influenza vaccines. The receipt of influenza vaccination among individuals with ASCVD is lower among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites with significant state-level variation. There are important socioeconomic determinants that are associated with receipt of the influenza vaccine. Copyright Published by Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A review of potential suggested drugs for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) treatment. The latest pandemic, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is associated with high prevalence and easy transmission, which is expanding globally with no conventional treatment or vaccine. The new virus revealed 79% and 50% genomic similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively. Accordingly, since the disease resists testing and adopting new therapeutics, repositioning pre-existing drugs may present a fast and attractive strategy with known safety, characteristics, and dosage used. However, they are not specific and targeted. Therefore, several drugs have been investigated for their efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19; most of them are undergoing clinical trials. This article summarizes clinical investigations of potential therapeutic drugs used as COVID-19 therapy. Subsequently, it prepares a pattern of results and therapeutic targets to help further experiment designs. We have investigated drugs as classified in the following three groups; 1) The drugs which computationally showed effectiveness (in silico) but needed further lab confirmations; 2) Emetine, Teicoplanin, and Nelfinavir have shown effectiveness in vitro; 3) The drugs currently under clinical trial.

Serological tests play an essential role in monitoring and combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant spike protein (S protein), especially the S1 protein, is one of the major reagents used for serological tests. However, the high cost of S protein production and possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses pose unavoidable challenges. By taking advantage of a peptide microarray with full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results, we identified several S protein-derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnostic performance. In particular, for monitoring the IgG response, one peptide (aa 1148-1159 or S2-78) exhibited a sensitivity (95.5%, 95% CI 93.7-96.9%) and specificity (96.7%, 95% CI 94.8-98.0%) comparable to those of the S1 protein for the detection of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the S2-78 (aa 1148-1159) IgG was successfully validated by ELISA in an independent sample cohort. A panel of four peptides, S1-93 (aa 553-564), S1-97 (aa 577-588), S1-101 (aa 601-612) and S1-105 (aa 625-636), that likely will avoid potential cross-reactivity with sera from patients infected by other coronaviruses was constructed.

Naive (TN), central memory (TCM), effector memory (TEM), and terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, subsets of T follicular helper cells (cTFH, TFH1, TFH2, TFH17, TFH1/TFH17, and TFR), CD4 Treg, CD8 Treg, mature B cells, transitional B cells, marginal zone B cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, CD21low B cells, antibody-secreting cells (plasmablasts), and Breg cells were examined in patients and age-matched controls with appropriate monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls using multicolor flow cytometry. Different patterns of abnormalities (often contrasting) were observed in the subsets of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B-cell subsets, and regulatory lymphocytes among the immunocompetent patient and CVID patient as compared to corresponding healthy controls. Furthermore, when data were analyzed between the 2 patients, the immunocompetent patient demonstrated greater changes in various subsets as compared to the CVID patient. These data demonstrate different immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompetent patient and the CVID patient. A marked decrease in GC B cells and plasmablasts may be responsible for failure to make SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of adults in the United States because of recommended preventive behaviors such as physical distancing. Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and identify associated determinants among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States., METHODS: We used nationally representative data of 10,760 US adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We estimated associations of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression. We estimated determinants of reporting at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the 7 days before survey administration among cancer survivors using multivariable Poisson regression., RESULTS: Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.90); depressed (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.09); lonely (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.91); and hopeless (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.06) 3-7 days per week in the last 7 days when compared with adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults of age 30-44 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.95), females (aPR, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), adults without a high school degree (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.95) were more likely to report at least one mental health-related symptom in the last 7 days (3-7 days/week)., CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors are reporting mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, women, and survivors with limited social support.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In this ongoing theme of COVID-19 pandemic, highly sensitive analytical testing platforms are extremely necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antiviral antibodies. To limit the viral spread, prompt and precise diagnosis is crucial to facilitate treatment and ensure effective isolation. Accurate detection of antibodies (IgG and IgM) is imperative to understand the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in public and to inspect the proportion of immune individuals. In this review, we demonstrate and evaluate some tests which have been used commonly to detect SARS-CoV-2. These include nucleic acid tests and serological tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific antibodies in infected people. Moreover, the vitality of biosensing technologies emphasizing on optical and electrochemical biosensors towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed here. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction owing to virus induced dysfunctioning of lung cells has also been highlighted.

DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time., PURPOSE: This report describes our process of 4 health systems coming together to agree on standard use criteria for remdesivir as a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment for patients in Utah. We hope our process provides a framework for remdesivir use in other states and insights on future use of other therapeutic agents that may also be in short supply, such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies., SUMMARY: Emergency use authorization (EUA) criteria for COVID-19 treatments often allow for broad use of a treatment relative to limited supplies. Without national criteria, each health system must develop further rationing criteria. Health systems in Utah worked together as part of the state's crisis standards of care workgroup to develop a framework for how to limit the EUA criteria for remdesivir to match available supplies. The 4 largest health systems were represented by infectious diseases specialists, chief medical officers, and pharmacists. The group met several times online and communicated via email over a 9-day period to develop the criteria. The clinicians agreed to use this framework to develop criteria for future therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies., CONCLUSION: The unique collaboration of the 4 health systems in Utah led to statewide criteria for use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19, ensuring similar access to this limited resource for all patients in Utah.

Vaccinations are effective in preventing infections; however, it is unknown if patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who are treatment naive (TN) or receiving Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's) respond to novel adjuvanted vaccines. Understanding the effect of BTKi's on humoral immunity is timely because BTKi's are widely used and vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is urgently needed. In 2 open-label, singlearm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKi's on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary end point was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies >=10 mIU/mL) and RZV (>=fourfold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-18.9) than patients who were TN (28.1%; 95% CI, 15.6-45.4; P = .017).

Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the data of 99 patients who were followed up during travel and post-Umrah quarantine between 31 March and 15 April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Of the 99 patients included in the study, 66 (66.7%) were females, 33 (33.3%) were males, and mean age was 59.8 +/- 11.4 years. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive at the time of admission in 97 (98.0%) of the 99 patients. Thirty-nine (39.4%) of the patients were symptomatic and 25.3% of the patients had cough, 8.1% had fever, and 7.1% had shortness of breath. While SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test was negative in 2 (3.3%) of the 60 patients without complaints, 58 (96.7%) of them were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test.

{"text": "Deregulated cellular circuits driving immunoglobulins and complement consumption associate with the severity of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for the outcome of COVID-19. We investigated whether the specific immune responses in the peripheral blood of 276 patients were associated with the severity and progression of COVID-19. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B, and NK cells is associated with severity. Conversely, the proportion of B cells, plasmablasts, circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) and CD56-CD16+ NK-cells increased. Regarding humoral immunity, levels of IgM, IgA, and IgG were unaffected, but when degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients. Compared to healthy donors, complement C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, while the activation peptide of C5 (C5a) increased from the admission in every patient, regardless of their severity. Moreover, total IgG, the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes, and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier.

{"text": "Precision shielding for COVID-19: metrics of assessment and feasibility of deployment. The ability to preferentially protect high-risk groups in COVID-19 is hotly debated. Here, the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high risk of death after infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people in a high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here are according to age (>=70 vs <70 years), and institutionalised (nursing home) setting. For age-related precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people>=70 years old. For setting-related precision shielding, data were analysed from 10 countries where information was available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among COVID-19 deaths and overall population infection fatality rate (IFR). Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, that is, low-risk people being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in the USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with inverse protection. Assuming 25% IFR among nursing home residents, S values for nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea (S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany and Denmark. No shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), the UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1), nursing home residents were far more frequently infected than the rest of the population. In conclusion, the experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID-19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.

Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) to a unique set of challenges and stressors. Our frontline workers are under tremendous psychological pressure because of the ever-rising crisis. This study was done to assess the magnitude of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical and nonclinical HCWs in India. Material(s) and Method(s): It was a cross-sectional, online survey that was done from June 1, 2020, to July 4, 2020. A total of 313 clinical and nonclinical HCWs, who were directly or indirectly involved in patient care, participated in the study. The psychological impact was assessed in terms of four variables: insomnia, anxiety, depression, and stress. Insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Anxiety and depression were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). Stress was assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). We also compared the psychological impact of this pandemic between clinical and nonclinical HCWs. Result(s): 7.3% of HCWs were having moderate insomnia, 3.8% had severe insomnia, and 20.8% were having subthreshold insomnia. Severe anxiety and depression were found in 6.7% of respondents. 8.0 and 32.3% of the respondents had moderate and mild anxiety-depression, respectively. 6.4% had high perceived stress. 47.6 and 46.0% of the respondents had moderate and low stress, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in severe insomnia between clinical and nonclinical HCWs, whereas no significant difference in anxiety, depression, and stress between clinical and nonclinical HCWs.

Mortality was associated with the presence of ALF (OR = 9.423, 95% CI: 2.410-36.858) in contrast to milder liver injury (OR 1.101, 95% CI: 0.435-2.791). In 30% of patients with mild liver injury and in 50% of ALF patients, peak liver injury was observed at a time point when the virus was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. Conclusion(s): Mild liver injury was not associated with worse outcome in our cohort, and the pattern of liver injury did not fit well to the theory of SARS-CoV-2 directly causing liver impairment. Instead, severe liver injury in our cohort was associated multiple-organ failure and acute vascular events.Copyright \u00a9 2021 S. Karger AG.

{"text": "Mediterranean diet for the prevention of gestational diabetes in the covid-19 era: Implications of ll-6 in diabesity. The aim of this review is to highlight the influence of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Gestational Weight Gain (GWG) during the COVID- 19 pandemic era and the specific role of interleukin (IL)-6 in diabesity. It is known that diabetes, high body mass index, high glycated hemoglobin and raised serum IL-6 levels are predictive of poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The immunopathological mechanisms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection include rising levels of several cytokines and in particular IL-6. The latter is associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance and could be useful for predicting the development of GDM. Rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, MedDiet improves the immune system and could modulate IL-6, C reactive protein and Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB. Moreover, polyphenols could modulate microbiota composition, inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway, lower IL-6, and upregulate antioxidant enzymes. Finally, adhering to the MedDiet prior to and during pregnancy could have a protective effect, reducing GWG and the risk of GDM, as well as improving the immune response to viral infections such as COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Background and aims: Emerging data have linked the presence of cardiac injury with a worse prognosis in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, available data cannot clearly characterize the correlation between cardiac injury and COVID-19. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies to 1) explore the prevalence of cardiac injury in different types of COVID-19 patients and 2) evaluate the association between cardiac injury and worse prognosis (severe disease, admission to ICU, and mortality) in patients with COVID-19. Methods and Results: Literature search was conducted through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and MedRxiv databases. A meta-analysis was performed with Stata 14.0. A fixed-effects model was used if the I2 values <= 50%, otherwise the random-effects model was performed. The prevalence of cardiac injury was 19% (95% CI: 0.15-0.22, and p < 0.001) in total COVID-19 patients, 36% (95% CI: 0.25-0.47, and p < 0.001) in severe COVID-19 patients, and 48% (95% CI: 0.30-0.66, and p < 0.001) in non-survivors. Furthermore, cardiac injury was found to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of poor outcomes with a pooled effect size (ES) of 8.46 (95% CI: 3.76-19.06, and p = 0.062), severe disease with an ES of 3.54 (95% CI: 2.25-5.58, and p < 0.001), admission to ICU with an ES of 5.03 (95% CI: 2.69-9.39, and p < 0.001), and mortality with an ES of 4.99 (95% CI: 3.38-7.37, and p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of cardiac injury was greatly increased in COVID-19 patients, particularly in patients with severe disease and non-survivors.

{"text": "Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, DKA, and COVID-19: Causality or coincidence? A report of three cases. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a 2020 pandemic, has resulted in an unexpected loss in lives, quality of life, and the economy. The COVID-19 clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to death, and its complications may involve various organs. Notwithstanding, the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine systems is understudied. Previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, there were only two previous case reports on newly diagnosed DM in COVID-19 patients. Here, we described three patients who had newly diagnosed DM associated with COVID-19. COVID-19 likely unmasked existing DM by aggravating its metabolic complications rather than causing the new-onset DM in these patients. However, more research is needed to evaluate if there is a casual relationship between the development of DM, DKA, and COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Incidence in Patients With Immunomediated Inflammatory Diseases: Influence of Immunosuppressant Treatments. The effect of immunosuppressant treatments on the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. We studied the association between the pre-exposure to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that decrease immunological responses and the incidence of COVID-19 to explore the possible effects of these treatments in early manifestations of the disease. For this purpose, we performed a cross-sectional study including 2,494 patients with immunomediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) recruited at the outpatient Rheumatology, Dermatology and Gastroenterology services of Hospital del Mar. The primary outcome was the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 performed by a physician at the hospital or at the primary care center, from the March 1-29, 2020. Multivariable Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate COVID-19 relative risk (RR) adjusted by comorbidities. We revealed that biological (RR = 0.46, CI 95% = 0.31-0.67) and synthetic (RR = 0.62, CI 95% = 0.43-0.91) DMARDs used in IMIDs diminished the incidence of COVID-19. Striking sex differences were revealed with anti-TNF alpha compounds (RR = 0.50, CI 95% = 0.33-0.75) with higher effects in women (RR = 0.33, CI 95% = 0.17-0.647). Treatment with low glucocorticoid doses also revealed sex differences decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 predominantly in women (RR = 0.72, CI 95% = 0.42-1.22). Our results report a decreased incidence of COVID-19 in patients receiving specific DMARDs with different immunodepressor mechanisms with striking sex differences. These results underline the interest of repurposing specific DMARDs for the possibility of minimizing the severity of disease progression in the early stages of COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Also, data from Mexico are hospitable population-based without signs and symptoms information. For these reasons, this work aims to provide epidemiology information about the burden of COVID-19 in the Mexican outpatients and to identify symptomatic COVID-19 profiles that could help in the early diagnosis of the disease., METHODS: Between June to September, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data of 482,413 individuals diagnosed by RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Salud Digna clinics were collected., RESULTS: We observed a 41% incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with a mean age of 36 years, being young adults (20-40 years) the most affected. Among occupations, deliverers (OR 1.38) or informal traders (OR 1.33) had a higher risk of COVID-19. Moreover, 13% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were in presymptomatic patients. Finally, we identify three different symptomatic profiles (common, respiratory, and gastrointestinal) associated with COVID-19., CONCLUSION: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was high among outpatients with a significant proportion of presymptomatic carriers, so it is necessary increasing testing and continue the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance with a better description of signs and symptoms; in this regard, were identified three symptomatic profiles that could help in the diagnose of COVID-19.

{"text": "The Role of Anticoagulation in Post-COVID-19 Concomitant Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, and Left Ventricular Thrombus: A Case Report. BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ. The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease. On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles. The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes. The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community. CASE REPORT We report on a COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state in a 65-year-old man with no history of comorbid illness. Initially, he presented with right-sided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block. The patient's elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction (MI). His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19-associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature. But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented. The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes. Indeed, further studies are required to develop a standard management plan for what can be a fatal situation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Personal Protective Equipment and Headaches: Cross-Sectional Study Among Moroccan Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic. Background Healthcare workers in frontline during the coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic are mandated to wear specific personal protective equipment (PPE) including high filtrating masks and/or eye protection during extended period of time. Compressive headaches secondary to PPE use including N95 masks have been reported. We aim to describe subtypes of headache related to PPE use in our hospital in Casablanca and working condition factors associated with it. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers in frontline at Cheikh khalifa International University Hospital, using an online questionnaire. We collected demographic data, comorbidities and previous headaches history. Data about working conditions during pandemic, type and duration of PPE use were described. We calculated the prevalence of De Novo or an aggravated headache among healthcare workers. We studied correlations between PPE related headaches and working conditions and trends in PPE use during the pandemic. Finally, we described the overall discomfort related to PPE use. Results A total of 155 healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. The N95 masks were the most used type (95.5%) associated with an eye protection in 61.3%. The overall prevalence of headache related to PPE was 62%. It was experienced De Novo in 32.9%, while it was an aggravation of pre-existing headache in 29%. Working more than 8 hours per shift during the pandemic was correlated to De novo headache (p = 0.008). The profession of doctor and working more than 12 hours per shift were correlated to aggravated headache (p = 0.02, p = 0.023). Healthcare workers experienced moderate discomfort, blurred vision and reduced concentration. They judged their professional performance mildly reduced by the use of PPE. Conclusion The increased use of PPE, especially high filtrating masks during the COVID-19 outbreak is responsible for generating headaches in healthcare workers on frontline either De novo or as an aggravation of pre-existing one. Working conditions have the greater impact on generating these types of headaches more than any pre-existing comorbidity. These findings should be considered to accommodate health care professionals to increase efficacy and adherence to protective measures during pandemic.

{"text": "A novel machine learning framework for comparison of viral COVID-19-related sina weibo and twitter posts: Workflow development and content analysis. Background: Social media plays a critical role in health communications, especially during global health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum. Objective(s): We aimed to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework and contrast how content features differ with sociocultural background in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms. Method(s): We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications. Result(s): There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues. Conclusion(s): We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse related to COVID-19 in different sociocultural backgrounds. In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Morphological profiling of cells in the presence of perturbants, also known as phenomics, is gaining momentum given its successful implementation for drug discovery and compound profiling. The current COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the search for new and fast methods to identify novel or repurposed therapeutic drugs. A popular method to identify antiviral drugs is the use of antibody-based immunofluorescence to visualise infected cells. However, this method lacks depth towards the effect of such drugs on the host cells. Here we present a phenomics workflow for untargeted phenotypic drug screening of virus infected cells, combining Cell Painting with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single and simple method and provide a semi-automated image analysis pipeline for classification and feature extraction of virus infected cells. Our phenomics workflow provides valuable information about the effect of both virus and drugs on the host cells. We validated our method using a panel of 9 antiviral compounds including known and novel compounds on MRC5 human lung fibroblasts infected with Human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E).

{"text": "Subtle olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children. Objectives: Anosmia/hyposomia have been described as early signs of COVID-19 infection in adults, including young asymptomatic patients who commonly refer olfactory disfunction as their only clinical manifestation. Very few studies involving paediatric age patients have been published until now. This study aims to determine the presence of olfactory dysfunction in children with COVID-19 infection through the use of a self-reported questionnaire and a new olfactory screening tool. Methods: Nested case-control study. All paediatric patients screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for COVID-19 infection, during the study period (March-May 2020), were asked to respond to a questionnaire about symptoms of olfactory disfunction. Patients above six years old also performed an odor identification test based on seven odorants (Kradeo (R)). This test was designed based on our cultural context and eating habits. Results: 126 patients were recruited, including 33 with COVID-19 infection. 15% of the infected children referred anosmia and/or dysgeusia on the questionnaire, all of them were older than eleven years. The results of the odor test (69 patients) revealed subtle disturbances in the infected group (mostly misrecognition of odorants). Median odorant recognition was 3 odors [Interquartile range (IQR) 2-4] in case group and 4 [IQR 3-5] in controls. Male patients showed significantly larger disturbances than girls in both groups (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Self-referred prevalence of olfactory disfunction in our sample of infected children is lower than that described in adults, especially among the youngest ones, maybe due to immature development of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed in nasal mucosa. Nevertheless, one month after infection, subtle disturbances (misrecognition of odors) were identified among the infected children. This screening olfactory test provides a hygienic, user-friendly tool, suitable for screening children older than six years of age.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unresponsive to conventional ICU management is an accepted indication for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) support. The frequency with which patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are selected for V-V ECMO has not been described. This was a cohort study including all patients placed on either V-V ECMO or V-AV ECMO at the four adult ECMO Centers of Excellence. Primary outcomes evaluated were survival to decannulation from the ECMO circuit, survival to discharge, and 60-day survival. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, length of ECMO cannulation, and length of intubation. During the study period, which corresponded to the first surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Minnesota, 35 patients with ARDS were selected for V-V ECMO support out of 1849 adult ICU patients with COVID-19 infection in the state (1.9% incidence, 95% CI 1.3%-2.6%).

BACKGROUND: To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed. BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel)., METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 mug with Algel-IMDG, 6 mug with Algel-IMDG, or 6 mug with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519)., FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10.5-26.1) participants in the 3 mug with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13.8-30.5) in the 6 mug with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8.1-22.7) in the 6 mug with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6.9-23.6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 mug with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87.9, 91.9, and 82.8 in the 3 mug with Algel-IMDG, 6 mug with Algel-IMDG, and 6 mug with Algel groups, respectively. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups., INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses.

OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has specific implications for oral and maxillofacial surgeons because of an increased risk of exposure to the virus during surgical procedures involving the aerodigestive tract. The objective of this survey was to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) training programs during the early phase of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: During the period April 3 to May 6, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was sent to the program directors of 95 of the 101 accredited OMFS training programs in the United States. The 35-question survey, designed by using Qualtrics software, aimed to elicit information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OMFS residency programs and the resulting specific modifications made to clinical care, PPE, and resident training/wellness. RESULT(S): The survey response rate from OMFS program directors was 35% (33 of 95), with most responses from the states with a high incidence of COVID-19. All OMFS programs (100%) implemented guidelines to suspend elective and nonurgent surgical procedures and limited ambulatory clinic visits by third week of March, with the average date being March 16, 2020 (date range March 8-23). The programs used telemedicine (40%) and modified in-person visit (51%) protocols for dental and maxillofacial emergency triage to minimize the risk of exposure of HCP to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was experienced by 51% of the programs. Almost two-thirds (63%) of the respondents recommended the use of a filtered respirator (i.e., N95 respirator) with full-face shield and stated that it was their preferred PPE, whereas 21% recommended the use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during OMFS procedures. Only (73%) of the programs had resources for resident wellness and stress reduction. Virtual didactic training sessions conducted on digital platforms, most commonly Zoom, formed a major part of education for all programs. CONCLUSION(S): All programs promptly responded to the pandemic by making appropriate changes, including suspending elective surgery and limiting patient care to emergent and urgent services. OMFS training programs should give more consideration to providing residents with adequate stress reduction resources to maintain their well-being and training and to minimize exposure risk during an evolving global epidemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Background: There are limited data on surgical complications for patients that have delayed surgery after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes of patients submitted to surgery after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Asymptomatic patients that had surgery delayed after preoperative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were matched in a 1:2 ratio for age, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists to patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): About 1253 patients underwent surgical procedures and were subjected to screening for SARS-CoV-2. Forty-nine cases with a delayed surgery were included in the coronavirus disease (COVID) recovery (COVID-rec) group and were matched to 98 patients included in the COVID negative (COVID-neg) group. Overall, 22 (15%) patients had 30-days postoperative complications, but there was no statistically difference between groups -16.3% for COVID-rec and 14.3% for COVID-neg, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 1.17:95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-3.0; p =.74).

The data from 91 patients with TAAD from the same centres during the same period last year were extracted from the Hubei Cardiac Surgery Registration System (control group). A propensity score matched subgroup of 26 pairs (1:2) was identified. Perioperative data and short-term outcomes were assessed. Result(s): Nine patients in the COVID-19 group were categorized as suspicious for the disease (9/27, 33.3%), and others were excluded (18/27, 66.7%). No one was laboratory confirmed preoperatively. The average waiting, cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times were longer in the COVID-19 group (22.9 +/- 8.3 vs 9.7 +/- 4.0 h, P < 0.001; 135 +/- 36 vs 103 +/- 45 min, P = 0.003; 24 +/- 9 vs 17 +/- 8 min, P < 0.001, respectively). The 30-day or in-hospital deaths were 3.8% in both groups (P = 1.0). The COVID-19 group was associated with longer ventilation and intensive care unit times (81 +/- 71 vs 45 +/- 19 h, P < 0.001; 7.4 +/- 3.8 vs 4.5 +/- 2.7 days; P < 0.001, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of complications such as stroke, neurological deficit, acute kidney injury, pulmonary infection and reoperation. Serum antibody tests for those patients showed 7 out of 9 suspected cases were Immunoglobulin G positive. No cross-infection occurred in other patients or associated medical staff. Conclusion(s): With adequate preparation and appropriate protection, satisfactory early outcomes can be achieved after emergency operations for patients with TAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Elevated levels of IgA and IgG2 in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury. Objectives: To determine circulating levels of antibodies (IgA, IgM, IgG1-4) in individuals with SCI as compared to uninjured individuals. Study Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting(s): Outpatient clinic of a Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and research institute in an academic medical center. Participant(s): Individuals with chronic (>= 1 year from injury) SCI and uninjured individuals. Outcome Measures: Serum antibody titers were determined by commercial multiplex ELISA. Result(s): Blood samples were collected from individuals with chronic SCI (N = 29, 83% males) and uninjured individuals (N = 25, 64% males). Among participants with SCI, the distribution of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades was: A (n = 15), B (n = 2), C (n = 4), D (n = 8). Neurological levels of injury were: cervical (n = 17), thoracic (n = 10), and lumbar (n = 2). IgA levels were significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 1.98 vs. 1.21 mg/ml, P < 0.0001), with levels most elevated in individuals with motor complete injuries compared to uninjured participants (P < 0.0003). IgG2 antibodies were also significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 5.98 vs. 4.37 mg/ml, P < 0.018). Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of elevated IgA, the antibody type most prevalent at respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, common sites of infections in individuals with SCI. IgG2 levels were also elevated in individuals with SCI. These data support further investigations of IgA and other antibody types in individuals with chronic SCI, which may be increasingly important in the context of emerging novel infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

Since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the pediatric population has been less affected by the disease both in frequency and severity. However, since April cases of variable presentation and severity characterized by inflammatory phenomena that affect multiple organs have been reported, a condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The literature has reported frequent cardiac involvement, up to 80%. This is characterized by myocardial injury with a significant increase of biomarkers such as serum troponins I and T, BNP, or NT-ProBNP coupled with varying degrees of ventricular dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, and arrhythmias. Coronary compromise has also been described, which can occur in up to 23% of cases, and ranges from dila-tations to aneurysms. Inpatient and outpatient cardiology follow-up has been systematized based on the clinical phenotypes such as myocardial injury (myocarditis, valvulitis, pericarditis), shock (usua-lly vasoplegic), Kawasaki disease-type manifestations, and those MIS-C that do not comply with the clinic of the previous three. This last group represents the main challenge in the short-, medium-and long-term follow-up, therefore, it is necessary a multidisciplinary team for managing these patients. Considering the high frequency of cardiac compromise in MIS-C, and the importance of reaching a consensus regarding its management and follow-up, we present these recommendations according to the current state of knowledge regarding this recently described pathology.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Sociedad Chilena de Pediatria.

We describe the optimisation of a simplified sample preparation method which permits rapid and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within saliva, using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Treatment of saliva samples prior to RT-LAMP by dilution 1:1 in MucolyseTM, followed by dilution in 10 % (w/v) Chelex\u00a9 100 Resin and a 98 degreeC heat step for 2 min enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in positive saliva samples. Using RT-LAMP, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in as little as 05:43 min, with no amplification detected in 3097 real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) negative saliva samples from staff tested within a service evaluation study, or for other respiratory pathogens tested (n = 22). Saliva samples can be collected non-invasively, without the need for skilled staff and can be obtained from both healthcare and home settings. Critically, this approach overcomes the requirement for, and validation of, different swabs and the global bottleneck in obtaining access to extraction robots and reagents to enable molecular testing by rRT-PCR.

Here, we develop two capsid-like particle (CLP)-based vaccines displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RBD antigens are displayed on AP205 CLPs through a split-protein Tag/Catcher, ensuring unidirectional and high-density display of RBD. Both soluble recombinant RBD and RBD displayed on CLPs bind the ACE2 receptor with nanomolar affinity. Mice are vaccinated with soluble RBD or CLP-displayed RBD, formulated in Squalene-Water-Emulsion. The RBD-CLP vaccines induce higher levels of serum anti-spike antibodies than the soluble RBD vaccines. Remarkably, one injection with our lead RBD-CLP vaccine in mice elicits virus neutralization antibody titers comparable to those found in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. Following booster vaccinations, the virus neutralization titers exceed those measured after natural infection, at serum dilutions above 1:10,000. Thus, the RBD-CLP vaccine is a highly promising candidate for preventing COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19, which emerged in 2019, was identified by the World Health Organization as a public health emergency of international concern. Brazil actively responded to contain the virus. This case study aims to examine Brazil's response to COVID-19 by investigating the country's actions and reflecting upon the outcomes throughout January and March 2020. The data collection strategy included gathering data from the country's intergovernmental organization's official website, epidemiological bulletins, and news reports, guided by intersectoral and interdisciplinary themes. Although the highest incidence rates were in the most rich and populated region in Brazil, it was the poorest region that had the highest case fatality rate. Nevertheless, Brazil took several non-pharmaceutical measures to control and mitigate the spread of the virus. However, the strategy seems to have failed to consider regional and social inequalities. The actions of the health minister were undermined by a conflicting discourse between the minister and the president. The outbreak of COVID-19 added an extra burden on the country's healthcare system and the existing economic crises; exacerbated the inherent social, political, and economic challenges; and exposed the country's contradictions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Nucleocapsid and Spike Proteins of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Induce IL6 in Monocytes and Macrophages-Potential Implications for Cytokine Storm Syndrome. The pandemic of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has led to the deaths of more than 1.5 million people worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which exhibits wide variation in the course of disease in different people, ranging from asymptomatic and mild courses to very severe courses that can result in respiratory failure and death. Despite the rapid progression of knowledge, we still do not know how individual cells of the immune system interact with the virus or its components, or how immune homeostasis becomes disrupted, leading to the rapid deterioration of a patient's condition. In the present work, we show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins induce the expression and secretion of IL-6 by human monocytes and macrophages, the first line cells of antiviral immune responses. IL-6 may play a negative role in the course of COVID-19 by inhibiting Th1-dependent immunity and stimulating Th17 lymphocytes, thus leading to an increased probability of a cytokine storm.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: To investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Study design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Method(s): A survey questionnaire was conducted with 200 industry workers (68% males and 32% females) who had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), their sense of fear, as well as their behaviour towards protective measures before and after the testing. Result(s): Participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged that the protective measures were appropriate. Respondents reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear, both before and after the testing. Although these indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in irresponsible non-adherence behaviours. Almost all respondents attributed their application of personal protection measures to factors other than the results of serological screening. Conclusion(s): Serological tests do not contribute to irresponsible non-adherence behaviours in an environment where protective measures are efficient.

Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted. Otolaryngological symptoms, including OD and GD, were collected through patient-reported outcome questionnaire and Sniffin'Sticks tests were carried out in a subset of patients., RESULTS: A total of 2579 patients were included, including 2166 mild (84.0%), 144 moderate (5.6%) and 269 severe-to-critical (10.4%) patients. Mild patients presented an otolaryngological picture of the disease with OD, GD, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and sore throat as the most prevalent symptoms. The prevalence of subjective OD and GD was 73.7 and 46.8%, and decreases with the severity of the disease. Females had higher prevalence of subjective OD and GD compared with males. Diabetes was associated with a higher risk to develop GD.

{"text": "Efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma with amotosalen and ultraviolet a light treatment. Background/Case Studies: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in January 2020 as the responsible agent for COVID-19. First recognized in late 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic developed into a pandemic with, as of July 23, 2020, more than 15 million cases and 600,000 deaths reported globally. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood samples and blood components from asymptomatic blood donors including frozen plasma units and platelet concentrates. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be a potential bloodborne pathogen and pathogen reduction offers potential to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission. We investigated the efficacy of amotosalen/UVA light to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma. Study Design/Methods: Five pools of whole-blood derived human plasma units (630-650 mL each) were inoculated with a local clinical isolate (SARS-CoV-2/ human/SAU/85791C/2020) with a 1:100 dilution. Spiked pools were used to evaluate the efficacy of amotosalen/ UVA treatment (INTERCEPT Blood System, Cerus Corporation, Concord, U.S.A.) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in plasma. Infectious and genomic viral titers were assessed by plaque assay and quantitative PCR (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), respectively, in spiked and treated samples in parallel with positive and negative controls. Results/Findings: Treatment of spiked plasma (titer of the viral stock: 5.6+/-0.2 log10 pfu/mL) with amotosalen/ UVA light resulted in complete inactivation of infectious viral titer with mean log reduction of >3.3+/-0.2 log10 pfu/mL. No viral replication or cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in cells inoculated with inactivated samples even after 9 days of incubation and three successive passages. Evaluation of genomic titer expressed in genome equivalent (GEq/mL) in inactivated samples showed equivalent reduction to the limit of detection of 7.10+/-0.2 log10 GEq/mL. Conclusion(s): Complete and efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 was observed with amotosalen/UVA light treatment of spiked human plasma units suggesting that treatment of plasma with this pathogen reduction technology could reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with prior inactivation data with amotosalen/UVA for other human-pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) in platelets and plasma.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A deeper understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be required to refine vaccine development and efficacy as well as to evaluate long-term immunity in convalescent patients. With this in mind, we investigated the formation of SARS-CoV-2 specific BMEMORY cells from patient blood samples. <h4>Methods:</h4> A standard flow cytometry-based protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells was applied using fluorochrome-coupled SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) full-length protein.

{"text": "Excessive matrix metalloproteinase-1 and hyperactivation of endothelial cells occurred in COVID-19 patients and were associated with the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 starts as a respiratory disease that can progress to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and multi-organ failure. Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic illness that primarily injures the vascular endothelium, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to trigger a cytokine storm that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelialitis and vascular injury, eventually leading to respiratory and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients. We used a multiplex immunoassay to systematically profile and compare 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). Patients with severe/critical and mild/moderate COVID-19 had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only one cytokine (MIF) was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines and growth factors. In addition, only MMP-1 and VEGF-A were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. Given that excessive MMP-1 plays a central role in tissue destruction in a wide variety of vascular diseases and that elevated VEGF-A, an EC activation marker, increases vascular permeability, we further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and other EC activation markers such as soluble forms of CD146, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. We found that plasma MMP-1 enzymatic activity and plasma levels of MMP-1 and EC activation markers were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Some dysregulations were associated with patient age or gender, but not with race. Our results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients have distinct inflammatory profiles that are distinguished from the cytokine storms in other human diseases.

After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded. White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion., RESULTS: (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively. (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10.93 kAU/L to 114.7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56.44+/-39.40) kAU/L. NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted. Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs. 5 (3-8), P = 0.036]. Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively. (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0.81+/-0.28 vs. 1.00) and NEU (0.75+/-0.33 vs. 1.00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P < 0.05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion., CONCLUSIONS: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients. Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment. The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion.

{"text": "Evidence for adaptive evolution in the receptor-binding domain of seasonal coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. Seasonal coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) are endemic to the human population, regularly infecting and reinfecting humans while typically causing asymptomatic to mild respiratory infections. It is not known to what extent reinfection by these viruses is due to waning immune memory or antigenic drift of the viruses. Here, we address the influence of antigenic drift on immune evasion of seasonal coronaviruses. We provide evidence that at least two of these viruses, OC43 and 229E, are undergoing adaptive evolution in regions of the viral spike protein that are exposed to human humoral immunity. This suggests that reinfection may be due, in part, to positively-selected genetic changes in these viruses that enable them to escape recognition by the immune system. It is possible that, as with seasonal influenza, these adaptive changes in antigenic regions of the virus would necessitate continual reformulation of a vaccine made against them.

{"text": "Testing the efficacy and safety of BIO101, for the prevention of respiratory deterioration, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVA study): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: As of December, 1st, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, resulted in more than 1 472 917 deaths worldwide and death toll is still increasing exponentially. Many COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic or experience moderate symptoms and recover without medical intervention. However, older people and those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or heart disease are at higher risk of mortality. Because current therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients are limited specifically for this elderly population at risk, Biophytis is developing BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone, a Mas receptor activator) as a new treatment option for managing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the severe stage. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 spike protein seems to alter the function of ACE2, a key player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The clinical picture of COVID-19 includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiomyopathy, multiorgan dysfunction and shock, all of which might result from an imbalance of the RAS. We propose that RAS balance could be restored in COVID-19 patients through MasR activation downstream of ACE2 activity, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) a non-peptidic Mas receptor (MasR) activator. Indeed, MasR activation by 20-hydroxyecdysone harbours anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-fibrotic properties. BIO101, a 97% pharmaceutical grade 20-hydroxyecdysone could then offer a new therapeutic option by improving the respiratory function and ultimately promoting survival in COVID-19 patients that develop severe forms of this devastating disease. Therefore, the objective of this COVA study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIO101, whose active principle is 20-hydroxyecdysone, in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia., TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, group sequential and adaptive which will be conducted in 2 parts.

Participants who are officially discharged from hospital care will no longer receive study medication., MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary study endpoint: The proportion of participants with 'negative' events up to 28 days. 'Negative' events are defined as respiratory deterioration and all-cause mortality. For the purpose of this study, respiratory deterioration will be defined as any of the following: Requiring mechanical ventilation (including cases that will not be intubated due to resource restrictions and triage). Requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Requiring high-flow oxygen defined as delivery of oxygen at a flow of >=16 L/min. Only if the primary endpoint is significant at the primary final analysis the following Key secondary endpoints will be tested in that order: Proportion of participants with events of respiratory failure at Day 28 Proportion of participants with 'positive' events at Day 28. Proportion of participants with events of all-cause mortality at Day 28 A 'positive' event is defined as the official discharge from hospital care by the department due to improvement in participant condition. Secondary and exploratory endpoints: In addition, a variety of functional measures and biomarkers (including the SpO2 / FiO2 ratio, viral load and markers related to inflammation, muscles, tissue and the RAS / MAS pathways) will also be collected., RANDOMIZATION: Randomization is performed using an IBM clinical development IWRS system during the baseline visit. Block-permuted randomization will be used to assign eligible participants in a 1:1 ratio. In part 1, randomization will be stratified by RAS pathway modulator use (yes/no) and co-morbidities (none vs. 1 and above). In Part 2, randomization will be stratified by centre, gender, RAS pathway modulator use (yes/no), co-morbidities (none vs. 1 and above), receiving Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) at study entry (Yes/No) and suspicion of COVID-19 related myocarditis or pericarditis (present or not)., BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, and the study team assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment. All therapeutic units (TU), BIO101 b.i.d. or placebo b.i.d., cannot be distinguished in compliance with the double-blind process. An independent data-monitoring committee (DMC) will conduct 2 interim analyses. A first one based on the data from part 1 and a second from the data from parts 1 and 2. The first will inform about BIO101 safety, to allow the start of recruitment into part 2 followed by an analysis of the efficacy data, to obtain an indication of activity.

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 monoclonal receptor antibody, has been used in some centers for mitigating the severe inflammatory response seen in patients with severe COVID-19 with encouraging results. To the best of our knowledge, reports detailing the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing treatment with tocilizumab are sparse in sub-Saharan Africa. We describe the clinical and laboratory profile, chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan findings and clinical outcome in a Ghanaian patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab. A 54-year-old hypertensive male presented with fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction analysis done on a nasopharyngeal swab sample. His respiratory symptoms worsened while on admission despite receiving standard of care. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated to 80.59mg/L and chest CT scan findings were indicative of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was treated with a single 400mg dose of intravenous tocilizumab with a positive clinical outcome, rapid decline in CRP and improvement in chest CT findings.

OBJECTIVE: To follow up the cured and discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan Mobile Cabin Hospital and investigate their epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test results, so as to provide evidence for epidemic prevention and control., METHODS: The clinical data including epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging data of 117 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Hongshan Mobile Cabin Hospital from February 6 to March 10, 2020 were collected by telephone follow-up and analyzed, so as to provide evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19., RESULTS: Among the 117 COVID-19 patients who met the discharge criteria, there were 49 males and 68 females with an average age of (49.00+/-11.88) years old, and the average length of hospital stay was (17+/-6) days. Among them, 91 patients had no obvious symptoms after discharge, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients was 77.78%. A small number of patients had clinical symptoms such as chest distress, palpation and asthma, etc. after discharge. After discharge, 7 patients had chest distress symptom, 5 cases had sore throat and palpitate symptom, 4 patients still had cough, asthma and chest pain existed in 3 cases for each, and headache, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing existed in 1 case for each. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid results of 7 discharged patients were positive, with a re-positive rate of about 5.98%. The nucleic acid positive result occurred after 10-19 days in meeting the discharge standard. Most of the patients did not receive chest CT scan after discharge, but 24 cases of the patients received chest CT scan during follow-up showed normal manifestations, and the lesions of 6 patients were all almost absorbed or normal., CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan Mobile Cabin Hospital who were re-positive with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid after discharge did not cause further transmission. Moreover, the patients with re-positive nucleic acid results were not significantly correlated with their length of hospital stay and the presence of clinical symptoms after discharge as well as CT findings.

{"text": "Technology-based Health Solutions for Cancer Caregivers to Better Shoulder the Impact of COVID-19: A Systematic Review Protocol. <h4>Background: </h4> Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, partially owing to their compromised immune systems and curbed or cut cancer healthcare services caused by the pandemic. As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning cancer caregivers' distinctive challenges amid COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus from the database inception to the end of March, 2021. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy will be developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened against eligibility criteria developed a priori . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> COVID-19 has upended cancer care as we know it. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19. Furthermore, results of this study will also offer valuable insights for researchers who aim to develop interventions for cancer caregivers in the context of COVID-19. In addition, we also expect to be able to identify areas for improvement that need to be addressed in order for health experts to more adequately help cancer caregivers weather the storm of global health crises like COVID-19 and beyond.

{"text": "Model-based cellular kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: different immune response modes and treatment strategies. Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients\u2019 data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of na\u00efve T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response.

{"text": "Risks of and risk factors for COVID-19 disease in people with diabetes: a cohort study of the total population of Scotland. Background: We aimed to ascertain the cumulative risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes and compare it with that of people without diabetes, and to investigate risk factors for and build a cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 among people with diabetes. Method(s): In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from March 1, 2020, when the first case was identified, to July 31, 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation. Finding(s): Of the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5 463 300), the population with diabetes was 319 349 (5.8%), 1082 (0.3%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89.8%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0.1%) of 5 143 951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1.395 (95% CI 1.304-1.494; p<0.0001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2.396 (1.815-3.163; p<0.0001) in type 1 diabetes and 1.369 (1.276-1.468; p<0.0001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0.0001), and have been a smoker (p=0.0011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0.85 (0.83-0.86). Interpretation(s): Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.

Surveillance data obtained by public health agencies for COVID-19 are likely inaccurate due to undercounting and misdiagnosing. Using a Bayesian approach, we sought to reduce bias in the estimates of prevalence of COVID-19 in Philadelphia, PA at the ZIP code level. After evaluating various modeling approaches in a simulation study, we estimated true prevalence by ZIP code with and without conditioning on an area deprivation index (ADI). As of June 10, 2020, in Philadelphia, the observed citywide period prevalence was 1.5%. After accounting for bias in the surveillance data, the median posterior citywide true prevalence was 2.3% when accounting for ADI and 2.1% when not. Overall the median posterior surveillance sensitivity and specificity from the models were similar, about 60% and more than 99%, respectively.

{"text": "Using excess deaths and testing statistics to improve estimates of COVID-19 mortalities. Factors such as non-uniform definitions of mortality, uncertainty in disease prevalence, and biased sampling complicate the quantification of fatality during an epidemic. Regardless of the employed fatality measure, the infected population and the number of infection-caused deaths need to be consistently estimated for comparing mortality across regions. We combine historical and current mortality data, a statistical testing model, and an SIR epidemic model, to improve estimation of mortality. We find that the average excess death across the entire US is 13% higher than the number of reported COVID-19 deaths. In some areas, such as New York City, the number of weekly deaths is about eight times higher than in previous years. Other countries such as Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Spain exhibit excess deaths significantly higher than their reported COVID-19 deaths.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. The alveolar epithelium is a major target of the virus, but representative models to study virus host interactions in more detail are currently lacking. Here, we describe a human 2D air-liquid interface culture system which was characterized by confocal and electron microscopy and single-cell mRNA expression analysis. In this model, alveolar cells, but also basal cells and rare neuroendocrine cells, are grown from 3D self-renewing fetal lung bud tip organoids. These cultures were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 with mainly surfactant protein C-positive alveolar type II-like cells being targeted. Consequently, significant viral titers were detected and mRNA expression analysis revealed induction of type I/III interferon response program. Treatment of these cultures with a low dose of interferon lambda 1 reduced viral replication. Hence, these cultures represent an experimental model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be applied for drug screens.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

{"text": "Smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and mortality: an expanded re-analysis of a recent publication. BACKGROUND: There is a lot of debate about the effects of smoking on COVID-19. A recent fixed-effects meta-analysis found smoking to be associated with disease severity among hospitalized patients, but other studies report an unusually low prevalence of smoking among hospitalized patients. The purpose of this study was to expand the analysis by calculating the prevalence odds ratio (POR) of smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while the association between smoking and disease severity and mortality was examined by random-effects meta-analyses considering the highly heterogeneous study populations., METHODS: The same studies as examined in the previous meta-analysis were analyzed (N = 22, 20 studies from China and 2 from USA). The POR relative to the expected smoking prevalence was calculated using gender and age-adjusted population smoking rates. Random-effects meta-analyses were used for all other associations., RESULTS: A total of 7162 patients were included, with 482 being smokers. The POR was 0.24 (95%CI 0.19-0.30). Unlike the original study, the association between smoking and disease severity was not statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.98-1.98). In agreement with the original study, no statistically significant association was found between smoking and mortality (OR 1.86, 95%CI 0.88-3.94)., CONCLUSION: An unusually low prevalence of smoking, approximately 1/4th the expected prevalence, was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any association between smoking and COVID-19 severity cannot be generalized but should refer to the seemingly low proportion of smokers who develop severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalization. Smokers should be advised to quit due to long-term health risks, but pharmaceutical nicotine or other nicotinic cholinergic agonists should be explored as potential therapeutic options, based on a recently presented hypothesis.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Wells Score to Predict Pulmonary Embolism in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background: The association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hypercoagulability has been extensively described, and pulmonary embolism is a recognized complication of COVID-19. Currently, the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) relies on the Wells score and serum D-dimer levels. However, because COVID-19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population. We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19. Method(s): In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID-19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis. Age and sex, CTPA results, and associated D-dimer levels were entered in a database. The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve measured. Result(s): Of 459 patients with COVID-19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 (19%) had evidence of pulmonary embolism. Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above 4 points, and serum D-dimer levels 5 times above age-adjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism. However, only 33% of patients with pulmonary embolism had a Wells score of 4 points or higher. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic showed non-discriminating values (0.54) Conclusion(s): Although a Wells score of 4 or more points predicted pulmonary embolism in our cohort, the outcome can be present even with lower scores.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Most of them were transferred from smaller hospitals, often due to the need for an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system. Autopsy was performed in 8/17 COVID-19-proven patients after long-term treatment (mean: 33.6 days). Autopsy revealed that the typical pathological changes occurring during the early stages of the disease (e.g., thrombosis, endothelitis, capillaritis) are less prevalent at this stage, while severe diffuse alveolar damage and especially coinfection with different fungal species were the most conspicuous finding. In addition, signs of macrophage activation syndrome was detected in 7 of 8 patients.

Purpose: This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the responses of cancer patients' indifferent chemotherapy cycles to the unstructured treatment interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic in China., Patients and Methods: Data from 156 adult patients with common solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy or ready to begin chemotherapy after surgery before the COVID-19 outbreak were analyzed in the study. Patients' responses to the chemotherapy interruption and their anxiety were assessed., Results: Overall, 141 (90%) patients completed the study, and 115 (81.6%) accepted a switch from their previous intravenous chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. Of these, 29 (65.9%) patients with lung cancer, 25 (86.2%) with gastric cancer, 33 (89.2%) with colorectal cancer and 28 (90.3%) with breast cancer switched from intravenous to oral treatment, heeding their doctor's advice. Of the participants, 85 (60.3%) patients reported that they had taken at least one kind of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) scores increased in patients with advanced refractory cancer compared with the scores of adjuvant chemotherapy patients (P < 0.05). The prevalence of anxiety was high in cancer patients aged 60 years or older. Furthermore, anxiety was associated with advanced incurable cancer (P < 0.05), and this finding remained after adjusting for chronic pain. In addition, there were significantly increased scores of anxiety in patients with lung cancer (P <0 0.05)., Conclusion: Our study shows that most cancer patients remained relatively stable and had switched from intravenous to oral treatment at home.

{"text": "Point-of-care lung ultrasound for the assessment of pneumonia: a narrative review in the COVID-19 era. In the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era, point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has attracted increased attention. Prospective studies on LUS for the assessment of pneumonia in adult patients were extensively carried out for more than 10 years before this era. None of these prospective studies attempted to differentiate bacterial and viral pneumonia in adult patients using LUS. The majority of studies considered the LUS examination to be positive if sonographic consolidations or multiple B-lines were observed. Significant differences existed in the accuracy of these studies. Some studies revealed that LUS showed superior sensitivity to chest X-ray. These results indicate that point-of-care LUS has the potential to be an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The LUS diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units is more challenging in comparison with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in emergency departments due to the limited access to the mechanically ventilated patients and the high prevalence of atelectasis. However, several studies have demonstrated that the combination of LUS findings with other clinical markers improved the diagnostic accuracy. In the COVID-19 era, many case reports and small observational studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have been published in a short period. Multiple B-lines were the most common and consistent finding in COVID-19 pneumonia. Serial LUS showed the deterioration of the disease.

West Nile virus emerged in 2012, followed by emergence of Usutu virus in 2013. Although high seroprevalence rates of Toscana virus have been detected among residents of Croatian littoral, the virus remains neglected, with only a few clinical cases of neuroinvasive infections reported. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is a neglected neuroinvasive rodent-borne virus.

{"text": "Challenges, limitations, and solutions for orthodontists during the coronavirus pandemic: A review. INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic patients worldwide missed appointments during the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A significant problem with this virus is its high transmission power. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. The aim of this review is to examine orthodontic emergencies and the necessary strategies and measures for emergency and nonemergency treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. METHOD(S): The following databases were comprehensively searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Up-to-date data released by major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and major orthodontic associations involved in the pandemic were also evaluated. RESULT(S): Few studies were conducted on managing orthodontic offices or clinics during the pandemic, and most are not of high quality. Appropriate communication is the most important issue in managing orthodontic patients, particularly virtual counseling. Many orthodontic emergencies can be managed in this way by patients themselves. Most studies recommend using the filtering facepiece 2 masks, equivalent to N95 masks for non-COVID-19 patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures and all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in orthodontic visits. CONCLUSION(S): At this time, there are no definitive clinical protocols supported by robust evidence for orthodontic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Orthodontists should not rush to return to routine orthodontic work and should follow state guidelines. Nonemergency orthodontic visits should be suspended during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in high-risk areas. Resuming orthodontic procedures during the pandemic requires paying special attention to screening, performing maximum efforts to reduce aerosol generation, using appropriate personal protective equipment, having proper ventilation, and fully adhering to sterilization and disinfection principles.Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Association of Orthodontists.

{"text": "Distinct lung-homing receptor expression and activation profiles on NK cell and T cell subsets in COVID-19 and influenza. Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3 + , CXCR6 + , and/or CCR5 + NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections. <h4>Author summary</h4> The composition of in particular CXCR3 + and/or CXCR6 + NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease. Lung-homing receptor-expression is biased towards phenotypically activated NK cells and T cells, suggesting a functional role for these cells co-expressing in particular CXCR3 and/or CXCR6 upon homing towards the lung.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Bacterial superinfection pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure. Background: Severe community-acquired pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 is a leading cause of death. Current guidelines recommend patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia receive empirical antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial superinfection, but little evidence supports these recommendations., Methods: We obtained bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. We analyzed BAL samples with multiplex PCR and quantitative culture to determine the prevalence of superinfecting pathogens at the time of intubation and identify episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) over the course of mechanical ventilation. We compared antibiotic use with guideline-recommended care., Results: The 179 ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia discharged from our hospital by June 30, 2020 were analyzed. 162 (90.5%) patients had at least one BAL procedure; 133 (74.3%) within 48 hours after intubation and 112 (62.6%) had at least one subsequent BAL during their hospitalization. A superinfecting pathogen was identified within 48 hours of intubation in 28/133 (21%) patients, most commonly methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species (21/28, 75%). BAL-based treatment reduced antibiotic use compared with guideline-recommended care. 72 patients (44.4%) developed at least one VAP episode. Only 15/72 (20.8%) of initial VAPs were attributable to multidrug-resistant pathogens. The incidence rate of VAP was 45.2/1000 ventilator days., Conclusions: With use of sensitive diagnostic tools, bacterial superinfection at the time of intubation is infrequent in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Treatment based on current guidelines would result in substantial antibiotic overuse. The incidence rate of VAP in ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are higher than historically reported.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: As a protective measure to slow down the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 in Korea, social distancing was implemented from February 29th, 2020. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of domestic incidents and intentional injury during March 2020 when social distancing was in effect. Method(s): There were 12,638 patients who visited the Level 1 trauma center of Chungnam province with injuries from domestic incidents, familial discord, and intentional injury. The prevalence of injuries during March 2020 was compared with the average of the previous 5 years, and the average for every March between 2015 and 2019. Result(s): The prevalence of domestic incidents in March 2020 was significantly higher than the 5-year average, and the average for every March from 2015 to 2019 (p < 0.001). Familial discord (p = 0.002) and intentional injury (p = 0.031) were more frequently observed in March 2020. Adolescents showed a markedly higher level of intentional injury in March 2020 than in both the 5-year average (p = 0.031), and average for every March over the previous 5 years (p = 0.037).

Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, prone position (PP) has been frequently used in the intensive care units to improve the prognosis in patients with respiratory distress. However, turning patients to prone imply important complications such as pressure ulcers. The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of prone-positioning pressure sores (PPPS) and analyze the related risk factors. Method(s): A case-control study was performed in Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and May 2020. We enrolled 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients in critical care units with invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with pronation therapy. There were 57 cases and 17 controls. Demographic data, pronation maneuver characteristics and PPPS features were analyzed. Result(s): In the case group, a total number of 136 PPPS were recorded. The face was the most affected region (69%). Regarding the severity, stage II was the most frequent. The main variables associated with an increased risk of PPPS were the total number of days under pronation cycles, and PP maintained for more than 24 h. The prealbumin level at admission was significantly lower in the case group. All of the ulcers were treated with dressings. The most frequent acute complication was bleeding (5%). Conclusion(s): According to our study, PPPS are related to the characteristics of the maneuver and the previous nutritional state.

{"text": "A method to detect immunoreactions on the basis of current vs. concentration slope - an electrochemical approach. The emergence of novel infectious diseases is rising with time and is a major threat to the society. The recent outbreak of infectious coronavirus disease has made a huge impact in our lives. The massive outbreak of the disease revealed that there is room for development of new diagnostics tools and methods to screen huge numbers of samples in the shortest possible time. Our current work relates to an electronic diagnostic system and method that rapidly detects the presence of an antigen in solution. Our designed system is capable of separating the immunocomplex formation on the basis of the slope it produces in contrast to the controls, when oxidation peak current is plotted against the concentration of the reactant after electrochemistry measurement. In this system, antibody conjugated copper nanoparticles synthesized by the electroexplosion method has played the key role. The values of the slopes of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was found to be -3.7637, whereas those for CuNP conjugated Antibody and CuNPAntibodyAntigen were -2.3044 and -0.8332, respectively. Hence, the current method could become one of the easiest and fastest method for the electronic detection of an immune reaction and a good replacement for the time-consuming, label-based assays in multistep reaction.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Atypical Divergence of SARS-CoV-2 Orf8 from Orf7a within the Coronavirus Lineage Suggests Potential Stealthy Viral Strategies in Immune Evasion. Orf8, one of the most puzzling genes in the SARS lineage of coronaviruses, marks a unique and striking difference in genome organization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. Here, using sequence comparisons, we unequivocally reveal the distant sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 Orf8 with its SARS-CoV-1 counterparts and the X4-like genes of coronaviruses, including its highly divergent \"paralog\" gene Orf7a, whose product is a potential immune antagonist of known structure. Supervised sequence space walks unravel identity levels that drop below 10% and yet exhibit subtle conservation patterns in this novel superfamily, characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich topology. We document the high accuracy of the sequence space walk process in detail and characterize the subgroups of the superfamily in sequence space by systematic annotation of gene and taxon groups. While SARS-CoV-1 Orf7a and Orf8 genes are most similar to bat virus sequences, their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts are closer to pangolin virus homologs, reflecting the fine structure of conservation patterns within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The divergence between Orf7a and Orf8 is exceptionally idiosyncratic, since Orf7a is more constrained, whereas Orf8 is subject to rampant change, a peculiar feature that may be related to hitherto-unknown viral infection strategies. Despite their common origin, the Orf7a and Orf8 protein families exhibit different modes of evolutionary trajectories within the coronavirus lineage, which might be partly attributable to their complex interactions with the mammalian host cell, reflected by a multitude of functional associations of Orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 compared to a very small number of interactions discovered for Orf7a. IMPORTANCE Orf8 is one of the most puzzling genes in the SARS lineage of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Using sophisticated sequence comparisons, we confirm its origins from Orf7a, another gene in the lineage that appears as more conserved, compared to Orf8. Orf7a is a potential immune antagonist of known structure, while a deletion of Orf8 was shown to decrease the severity of the infection in a cohort study. The subtle sequence similarities imply that Orf8 has the same immunoglobulin-like fold as Orf7a, confirmed by structure determination. We characterize the subgroups of this superfamily and demonstrate the highly idiosyncratic divergence patterns during the evolution of the virus.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 patients may become predisposed to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that have killed over one million people worldwide so far. To date, over forty million people have officially been identified to be infected with this virus with less than 3% death rate. Since many more people are expected to have been infected with this virus without the official diagnosis, the number of people who have recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be substantial. Given the large number of people recovered from either the mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe COVID-19 conditions, it is critical to understand the long-term consequences of the infection by this virus. Our histological evaluations revealed that patients died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls, one important hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By contrast, such pulmonary vascular remodeling lesions were not found in patients died of SARS-CoV-1 during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak or due to the infection by H1N1 influenza. The advancement in the treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been remarkable that HIV-infected individuals now live for a long time, in turn revealing that these individuals become susceptible to developing PAH, a fatal condition. We herein hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that is capable to triggering the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to developing PAH in the future. Given the large number of people being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic and that most people recover from severe, mild or asymptomatic conditions, it is imperative to generate scientific information on how the health of recovered individuals may be affected long-term. PAH is one lethal consequence that should be considered and needs to be monitored. This may also foster the research on developing therapeutic agents to prevent PAH, which has not so far been successful. Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

This paper introduces a cooperatively inspired open-source framework, for intelligent mining of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We situate this study within the African context, to drive advancement on state-of-the-art, towards intelligent infectious disease characterization and prediction. The outcome is an enriched Knowledge Base, sufficient to provide deep understanding of the viral sub-strains\u2019 identification problem. We also open investigation by gender, which to the best of our knowledge has been ignored in related research. Data for the study came from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://gisaid.org) and processed for precise discovery of viral sub-strains transmission between and within African countries. To localize the transmission route(s) of each isolate excavated and provide appropriate links to similar isolate strain(s), a cognitive solution was imposed on the genome expression patterns discovered by unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) component planes visualization. The Freidman-Nemenyi\u2019s test was finally performed to validate our claim. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Evidence of inter- and intra-genome diversity was noticed. While some isolates (or genomes) clustered differently, implying different evolutionary source (or high-diversity), others clustered closely together, indicating similar evolutionary source (or less-diversity). SOM component planes analysis revealed multiple sub-strains patterns, strongly suggesting local- or intra-community and country to country transmissions. Cognitive maps of both male and female isolates revealed multiple transmission routes. Freidman\u2019s test results showed highly significant difference (p<0.01) among the various isolate groups. Nemenyi\u2019s test revealed groups that differed in their isolates. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> The proposed framework offers explanations to SARS-CoV-2 diversity and provides real time identification to disease transmission routes, as well as rapid decision support for facilitating inter- and intra-country contact tracing of infected case(s). Intermediate data produced in this paper are helpful to enrich the genome datasets for intelligent characterization and prediction of COVID-19 and related pandemics, as well as the construction of intelligent device for accurate infectious disease monitoring.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Respiratory tract infections (influenza, acute respiratory infections (ARIs), community-acquired pneumonia, etc.) pose a serious threat to organized groups (including military personnel, cadets, students of military universities, and schools). The most common complication of ARI is community-acquired pneumonia, severe forms of which may result in an unfavorable outcome. The use of some drugs, such as Carmolis ensures a 2.0-3.8 times reduction in the incidence of ARIs in organized groups and a 2.3-3.0 times reduction in the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia. Carmolis has a pronounced non-specific protective effect and increases resistance to respiratory tract infections by promoting nonspecific resistance of the organism. This prevents significant economic damage and reduces the number of complications and poor outcomes.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Dynasty Publishing House.

OBJECTIVES: In most European countries, patients seeking medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic are still required to attend healthcare settings in person. We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by online telemedicine increased following the emergence of COVID-19., METHODS: We examined 3915 requests for self-managed abortion to online telemedicine service Women on Web (WoW) between 1 January 2019 and 1 June 2020. We used regression discontinuity to compare request rates in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests., RESULTS: Five countries showed significant increases in requests to WoW, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (97 requests vs 75.8 expected requests, p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (34 requests vs 14.2 expected requests, p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (1 request vs 8.1 expected requests, p<0.001). Among countries with significant increases in requests, abortion services are provided mainly in person in hospitals or abortion is unavailable and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain implemented a fully remote no-test telemedicine service., CONCLUSION: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate demand for remote models of care, which could be fulfilled by expanding access to medication abortion by telemedicine.

{"text": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs dampen the cytokine and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). As PGs play diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses, inhibiting PG production with NSAIDs could affect COVID-19 pathogenesis in multiple ways, including: (1) altering susceptibility to infection by modifying expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; (2) regulating replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells; and (3) modulating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate these potential roles. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates COX-2 in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. In contrast, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NSAID treatment reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by reduced neutralizing antibody titers. Our findings indicate that NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication. ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are critical for the generation of prostaglandins - lipid molecules with diverse roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs could therefore have multiple effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that NSAID treatment reduced both the antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of NSAIDs to modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has important implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis in patients. Whether this occurs in humans and whether it is beneficial or detrimental to the host remains an important area of future investigation. This also raises the possibility that NSAIDs may alter the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Copyright \u00a9 2021, American Society for Microbiology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a viral respiratory disease first reported in December 2019, quickly became a threat to global public health. Further understanding of the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk perception of the community may better inform targeted interventions to reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on people's self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes., METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models., RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19-infected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes. It also brings forth a greater understanding of the community's risk perceptions of serious COVID-19 disease. Hence, this study may aid health authorities to better adapt measures to the real needs of the population and to identify vulnerable individuals requiring further education and awareness of preventive measures.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of people worldwide, and considerable effort is focused on identifying certain populations at increased risk. ABO blood types have been associated with disease susceptibility; however, evidence remains limited. Our aim was to determine the association between ABO/Rh blood type with disease susceptibility and mortality among admitted COVID-19 patients., Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 requiring admission was undertaken. Demographics and pertinent medical history were analyzed with respect to ABO/Rh blood type: between the cases and a control population; as well as with respect to mortality in the COVID-19 population in univariate analysis. Potential confounding factors were evaluated by multivariate models. The main outcomes were disease susceptibility by comparison of blood type prevalence between populations, and mortality within the COVID-19 population., Results: A total of 825 cases (admitted with confirmed COVID-19 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) and 396 controls (seen at the same institution during the calendar year of 2019) were included. The COVID-19 population was older with male predominance. It was heavily represented by blood types O-positive (53%) and A-positive (23%), while lower representation was observed in groups B-positive (odds ratio (OR): 0.61, P = 0.013) and AB-positive (OR: 0.46, P = 0.014). Neither relationship remained significant in pairwise analysis. Within the COVID-19 population, no mortality difference was appreciated between ABO groups (P = 0.312), but higher mortality was observed in Rh negative group (P = 0.01). The latter of which was significantly confounded by age (P < 0.001), sex (P = 0.022), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis., Conclusions: While type A blood appears to be weakly more prevalent with respect to B and AB types in hospitalized patients, strong confounders of age and sex dilute this significance. Rh-negative patients appear to have a higher mortality, although this too is strongly confounded. Overall, ABO and Rh blood types do not have a significant relationship with susceptibility and mortality with COVID-19 infection in our population.

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains pandemic with considerable morbidity and mortality around the world. The aim of this study was to identify the predictors for the clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 who did not show clinical deterioration upon hospital admission., METHODS: Two-hundred fifty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital between January 23 and March 21, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, and treatments were all collected. The study endpoint was clinical deterioration within 20 days from hospital admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration., RESULTS: A total of 49 (19%) patients showed clinical deterioration after admission. Compared with patients that did not experience clinical deterioration, clinically deteriorated patients had more dyspnea, cough and myalgia (65.3% versus 29.3%) symptoms and more had comorbidities (89.8% versus 36.1%). Clinical and laboratory characteristics at admission that were associated with clinical deterioration included senior age, diabetes, hypertension, myalgia, higher temperature, systolic blood pressure, CRP, procalcitonin, activated partial thromboplastin time, aspertate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, direct bilirubin, plasma creatinine, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased albumin and bicarbonate concentration. Medical history of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, calcium channel blockers and metformin were also risk factors., CONCLUSION: The four best predictors for clinical deterioration were CRP, procalcitonin, age, and albumin. A \"best\" multivariable prediction model, resulting from using a variable selection procedure, included senior age, presentation with myalgia, and higher level of CRP and serum creatinine (bias-corrected c-statistic =0.909). Sensitivity and specificity corresponding to a cut point of CRP >=18.45 mg/L for predicting clinical deterioration were 85% and 74%, respectively.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Estimated number of N95 respirators needed for healthcare workers in acute care hospitals during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Objective: Due to shortages of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to estimate the number of N95s required for healthcare workers (HCW) to inform manufacturing targets and resource allocation. Method(s): We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute care hospital and the United States. Result(s): For an acute care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% IPR: 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR: 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases (22 [95% IPR: 10-43]-4,445 [95% IPR: 1,975-8,684]) if each N95 is used for five patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR: 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR: 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5-90% of the population is exposed (single-use), and 17.4 million (95% IPR: 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR: 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for five encounters. Conclusion(s): Our study quantifies the number of N95 respirators needed for a given acute care hospital and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic under varying conditions.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Cambridge University Press.

{"text": "Prevalence of COVID-19-related risk factors and risk of severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors: A matched cohort study using linked English electronic health records data. Background: People with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses., Methods: We included survivors (>=1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from English primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities., Findings: 108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more diabetes, asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, neurological, renal, and liver diseases, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR >5 years 2.22, 1.31-3.74)., Interpretation: Risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.

{"text": "Prospective cohort study of children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting to paediatric emergency departments: a Paediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) Study Protocol. INTRODUCTION: Relatively limited data are available regarding paediatric COVID-19. Although most children appear to have mild or asymptomatic infections, infants and those with comorbidities are at increased risk of experiencing more severe illness and requiring hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The recent but uncommon association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome has heightened the importance of understanding paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Paediatric Emergency Research Network-COVID-19 cohort study is a rapid, global, prospective cohort study enrolling 12 500 children who are tested for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. 47 emergency departments across 12 countries on four continents will participate. At enrolment, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test results, all children will have the same information collected, including clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, imaging and outcome data. Interventions and outcome data will be collected for hospitalised children. For all children, follow-up at 14 and 90 days will collect information on further medical care received, and long-term sequelae, respectively. Statistical models will be designed to identify risk factors for infection and severe outcomes., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Sites will seek ethical approval locally, and informed consent will be obtained. There is no direct risk or benefit of study participation. Weekly interim analysis will allow for real-time data sharing with regional, national, and international policy makers. Harmonisation and sharing of investigation materials with WHO, will contribute to synergising global efforts for the clinical characterisation of paediatric COVID-19. Our findings will enable the implementation of countermeasures to reduce viral transmission and severe COVID-19 outcomes in children., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04330261.

{"text": "Rhabdomyolysis is Associated with In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19. PURPOSE: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) has been associated with many viral infectious diseases, and associated with poor outcomes. We aim to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis (RM) in patients with COVID-19., METHOD: This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort study of 1,014 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between February 17 and April 12, 2020., RESULTS: The overall incidence of RM was 2.2%. Compared with patients without RM, those with RM tended to have a higher risk of deterioration. Patients with RM also constituted a greater percentage of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (90.9% vs 5.3%, P < 0.001) and a greater percentage of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (86.4% vs 2.7% P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with RM had laboratory test abnormalities, including the presence of markers of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and kidney injury. Patients with RM also had a higher risk of in-hospital death (P < 0.001). Cox's proportional hazard regression model analysis confirmed that RM indicators, including peak creatine kinase (CK) levels > 1000 IU/L (HR = 6.46, 95% CI: 3.02-13.86) and peak serum myoglobin (MYO) concentrations > 1000 ng/mL (HR = 9.85, 95% CI: 5.04-19.28), were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 that developed RM tended to have delayed viral clearance., CONCLUSION: RM might be an important contributing factor to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The early detection and effective intervention of RM may help reduce mortality among COVID-19 patients. Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the Shock Society.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in eliminating trachoma as a public health problem. BACKGROUND: Progress towards elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has been substantial, but the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted community-based control efforts., METHODS: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma., RESULTS: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of 1. We find that when the basic reproduction number is <1, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is >1, significant delays can occur. In most districts, 1 y of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease., CONCLUSIONS: If the pandemic can motivate judicious, community-specific implementation of control strategies, global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem could be accelerated.

The incidence of heart failure (HF) remains high and patients with HF are at risk for frequent hospitalisations. Remote monitoring technologies may provide early indications of HF decompensation and potentially allow for optimisation of therapy to prevent HF hospitalisations. The need for reliable remote monitoring technology has never been greater as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid expansion of a new mode of healthcare delivery: the virtual visit. With the convergence of remote monitoring technologies and reliable method of remote healthcare delivery, an understanding of the role of both in the management of patients with HF is critical.

{"text": "The experience of contact tracing in Singapore in the control of COVID-19: highlighting the use of digital technology. Purpose: Containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would require aggressive contact tracing and isolation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. Method(s): An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. Result(s): Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. Conclusion(s): Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.Copyright \u00a9 2020, SICOT aisbl.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has disrupted global and local medical supply chains. To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13th, 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior., METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described., RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8-53)., CONCLUSION: A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior.

{"text": "Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 detection and reversed RT-PCR results in mild or asymptomatic patients. Background: The clinical course and viral detection period in mild or asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are not yet known. The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who were admitted at the Daegu-Gyeongbuk 7th community treatment centre in Korea between 9 March 2020 and 10 April 2020. Patients underwent an upper respiratory RT-PCR test every week until discharge. From the RT-PCR results, we evaluated the rate of prolonged (>3 weeks) SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. We analysed the proportion of reversed results, defined as a positive or indeterminate result one day after a negative RT-PCR result, according to time (<14, 15-21, 22-28, >28 days) from the initial positive RT-PCR result. Result(s): In 23% (69/300) of patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected more than 3 weeks after the initial positive RT-PCR. In 14% (42/300) of patients, the RT-PCR results were positive for more than 4 weeks. For 37.5% (152/405) of negative RT-PCR results, the results were reversed in the next day's test. And 43.5% (123/283) of negative RT-PCR results were reversed within 3 weeks of diagnosis.

{"text": "Magnesium in Infectious Diseases in Older People. Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

There were 28 patients (88%) showing typical radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest CT. The patients with COVID-19 were found in an increased risk of thromboembolism with much higher D-dimer levels than uninfected pregnant women. One neonate with asphyxia and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was reported., Conclusions: The considerable asymptomatic proportion of pregnant women with COVID-19 indicates symptom-based screening would miss a number of cases. Chest CT could provide a useful screening resource during the COVID-19epidemic outbreak. Anticoagulation therapy for the postpartum patients may be helpful for good prognosis.

Testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for all allogenic donations was implemented 05/18/20. This study was to determine how COVID-19 affected the donation habits of donors. Study Design/Methods: Three time periods were reviewed [May to June of 2018 vs. 2019 (control), May to June 2019 vs.2020 (study group)]. The following were reviewed: first-time, repeat, and lapsed donors (no donation > 2 years), gender, age, ethnicity, and ABO blood groups. Results/Findings: There were 264,593 donations.

Importance: Time spent in outdoor activities has decreased owing to home confinement for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Concerns have been raised about whether home confinement may have worsened the burden of myopia owing to substantially decreased time spent outdoors and increased screen time at home., Objective: To investigate the refractive changes and prevalence of myopia in school-aged children during the COVID-19 home confinement., Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cross-sectional study using school-based photoscreenings in 123535 children aged 6 to 13 years from 10 elementary schools in Feicheng, China, was conducted. The study was performed during 6 consecutive years (2015-2020). Data were analyzed in July 2020., Exposures: Noncycloplegic photorefraction was examined using a photoscreener device., Main Outcomes and Measures: The spherical equivalent refraction was recorded for each child and the prevalence of myopia for each age group during each year was calculated. The mean spherical equivalent refraction and prevalence of myopia were compared between 2020 (after home confinement) and the previous 5 years for each age group., Results: Of the 123535 children included in the study, 64335 (52.1%) were boys. A total of 194904 test results (389808 eyes) were included in the analysis. A substantial myopic shift (approximately -0.3 diopters [D]) was found in the 2020 school-based photoscreenings compared with previous years (2015-2019) for younger children aged 6 (-0.32 D), 7 (-0.28 D), and 8 (-0.29 D) years. The prevalence of myopia in the 2020 photoscreenings was higher than the highest prevalence of myopia within 2015-2019 for children aged 6 (21.5% vs 5.7%), 7 (26.2% vs 16.2%), and 8 (37.2% vs 27.7%) years. The differences in spherical equivalent refraction and the prevalence of myopia between 2020 and previous years were minimal in children aged 9 to 13 years., Conclusions and Relevance: Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be associated with a significant myopic shift for children aged 6 to 8 years according to 2020 school-based photoscreenings. However, numerous limitations warrant caution in the interpretation of these associations, including use of noncycloplegic refractions and lack of orthokeratology history or ocular biometry data. Younger children's refractive status may be more sensitive to environmental changes than older ages, given the younger children are in a critical period for the development of myopia.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Reopening Schools and the Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Israel: A Nationwide Study. BACKGROUND: The benefits of school reopening must be weighed against the morbidity and mortality risks and the impact of enhancing spread of COVID-19. We investigated the effects of school reopening and easing of social distancing restrictions on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Israel, between March-July 2020., METHODS: We examined the nationwide agewise weekly incidence, prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, their positivity, COVID-19 hospitalizations and associated mortality. Temporal differences in these parameters following school reopening, school ending, and following easing of restrictions such as permission of large scale gatherings, were examined., RESULTS: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections gradually increased following school reopening in all age groups, with a significantly higher increase in adults compared to children. Higher relative ratios (RRs) of sample positivity rates 21-27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were found for the age groups 40-59 (RR: 4.72, 95% CI: 3.26 - 6.83) and 20-39 years (RR: 3.37 [2.51 - 4.53]), but not for children aged 0-9 (RR: 1.46 [0.85 - 2.51]) and 10-19 years (RR: 0.93 [0.65 - 1.34]). No increase was observed in COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths following school reopening. In contrast, permission of large-scale gatherings was accompanied by increases in incidence and positivity rates of samples for all age groups, and increased hospitalizations and mortality., CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support a major role of school reopening in the resurgence of the COVID-19 curve in Israel. Easing restrictions on large scale gatherings was the major influence on this resurgence. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

The objective of the study is to determine if neurological syndromes are associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality., METHODS: 581 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection, neurological involvement and brain-imaging were compared to hospitalized non-neurological COVID-19 patients. Four patterns of neurological manifestations were identified -acute stroke, new or recrudescent seizures, altered mentation with normal imaging, and neuro-COVID-19 complex. Factors present on admission were analyzed as potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing comorbidities, vital-signs, laboratory values, and pattern of neurological manifestations. Significant predictors were incorporated into a disease-severity score. Patients with neurological manifestations were matched with patients of the same age and disease severity to assess the risk of death., RESULTS: 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection were admitted to one medical system in New York City during a 6-week period. Of these, 581 (12%) had neurological issues of sufficient concern to warrant neuro-imaging. These patients were compared to 1743 non-neurological COVID-19 patients matched for age and disease-severity admitted during the same period. Patients with altered mentation (n=258, p =0.04, OR 1.39, CI 1.04 - 1.86) or radiologically confirmed stroke (n=55, p = 0.001, OR 3.1, CI 1.65-5.92) had a higher risk of mortality than age and severity-matched controls., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of altered mentation or stroke on admission predicts a modest but significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality independent of disease severity. While other biomarker factors also predict mortality, measures to identify and treat such patients may be important in reducing overall mortality of COVID-19. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

CONTEXT: - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged, currently pandemic virus, and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the inter-laboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited., OBJECTIVE: - To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey., DESIGN: - Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology., RESULTS: - A total of 4,125 qualitative results were received from 1,110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all three samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other two samples., CONCLUSIONS: - These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology.

{"text": "6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study. Background: The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. Method(s): We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. Finding(s): In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57.0 (IQR 47.0-65.0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186.0 (175.0-199.0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3.0 (IQR 2.0-5.0) for severity scale 3, 4.0 (3.0-5.0) for scale 4, and 5.0 (4.0-6.0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1.61 (95% CI 0.80-3.25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4.60 (1.85-11.48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0.88 (0.66-1.17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1.77 (1.05-2.97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0.74 (0.58-0.96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2.69 (1.46-4.96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96.2% vs 58.5%) and median titres (19.0 vs 10.0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2 at follow-up. Interpretation(s): At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

{"text": "Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: A matched case-control study. Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects and methods: A matched case-control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender, and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular disease symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Result(s): The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms and the level of stress were significantly higher among cases (59%; 71.6%; 73.7%, respectively) than among controls (25.6%; 31.1%; 43.3%, respectively). Chi-square and t-test showed significant associations and differences between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. Conclusion(s): These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.Copyright \u00a9 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 and type 1 diabetes mellitus. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major comorbidity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but less is known about COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Thus, our goal was to review the literature on COVID and T1DM. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 21 reports focusing on COVID-19 infections among patients with preexisting T1DM (n = 7), incident T1DM presentations during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 6), and outpatient management of T1DM during the COVID-19 quarantine (n = 8). These studies showed that patients with preexisting T1DM and COVID-19 infection often present with hyperglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although the risk of in-hospital mortality may be increased, hospitalization rates among patients with T1DM mirror that of the general population. The numbers of patients presenting with incident T1DM during COVID-19 quarantine have remained stable, but cases with severe DKA may have increased. COVID-19 quarantine has also impacted outpatient T1DM management and studies examining changes in glycemic control have shown mixed results. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has important implications for patients with type 1 diabetes, but additional studies with larger numbers of patients and longer term follow-up are needed to confirm the early findings highlighted in this review.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

{"text": "Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. Method(s): A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I2) statistics. Result(s): A total of 93 studies (n = 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50). Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Information regarding co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with vector-borne diseases (malaria and dengue) is crucial especially for the countries wherein malaria and dengue are endemic. The objective was to study the prevalence, demographic, clinical presentations among HCWs with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to compare the viral clearance in HCWs with COVID-19 and co-infection of malaria and dengue. This retrospective study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India April 6th-October 31st 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was confirmed by reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction. Out of 491 HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2, analysis of viral clearance was carried out in 467 HCWs over seven month periods, The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was 13% (491 out of 3711). Out of the HCWs with COVID-19, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among security guards (25%) with 1% mortality. The co-infection of malaria or dengue was reported in 31 HCWs (6.3%). The mean duration of virus clearance was longer (12 days) in symptomatic HCWs as compared to asymptomatic (8 days, p < .005). The recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was faster (mean 8 days) with co-infection of malaria than without malaria (p < .005). We recommend universal testing of HCWs, to optimize staffing levels during the current pandemic as HCWs are the most precious resource. There is a need to effectively implement standard protocols for prevention of vector-borne diseases, especially in the hospital settings.

No other immunomodulatory medications were initiated during this period. Seven patients matched for age and baseline biochemistry were a comparator group. Coagulation screening revealed no evidence of coagulopathy. However, von Willebrand Factor (VWF) activity, antigen and VWF antigen: ADAMTS13 ratio, Factor VIII and D-dimers were all elevated. Following 5 days of PEX, plasma levels of all the above, and ferritin levels, were significantly reduced (P < .05) while lymphocyte counts normalized (P < .05). The PaO2:FiO2 ratio increased from a median interquartile range (IQR) of 11.6 (10.8-19.7) kPa to 18.1 (16.0-25.9) kPa (P < .05). Similar improvements were not observed in controls. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred among five patients in the control arm but not in patients receiving PEX.

{"text": "Helping Children Hurt Themselves: Why Pediatricians Ought to Support Adolescent Football Players in Their Athletic Goals. Nonpharmaceutical interventions to minimize the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are necessary because we currently lack a vaccine or specific treatments. Healthcare facilities have adopted visitor restrictions and masking requirements. These interventions should be evaluated as public health measures, focusing on their efficacy, the availability of less-restrictive alternatives, and the minimization of the burdens and their balance with the benefits. These interventions, as well as exceptions, can be justified by the same analysis. For example, visitor restrictions are sound, as are exceptions for women in labor, adults with disabilities, minor children, and individuals who are dying. In implementing these policies, specific rules are preferable to general principles because they are more efficient and reduce possible bias. There should, however, be appeal mechanisms and retrospective review processes. Evaluating requests for medical exemptions to masking requirements is particularly difficult, given the prevalence of nonmedical objections, false claims of medical exemptions, and a lack of objective medical criteria. Requiring written statements by licensed healthcare providers that undergo subsequent substantive review may therefore be justified. Copyright 2021 The Journal of Clinical Ethics.

{"text": "Disruption of nasal bacteria enhances protective immune responses to influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in the induction of adaptive immune responses to influenza virus infection. However, the role of nasal bacteria in the induction of the virus-specific adaptive immunity is less clear. Here we demonstrate that while intranasal administration of influenza virus hemagglutinin vaccine alone was insufficient to induce the vaccine-specific antibody responses, disruption of nasal bacteria by lysozyme or addition of culturable oral bacteria from a healthy human volunteer rescued inability of the nasal bacteria to generate antibody responses to intranasally administered the split-virus vaccine. Myd88-depdnent signaling in the hematopoietic compartment was required for adjuvant activity of intranasally administered oral bacteria. In addition, we found that the oral bacteria-combined intranasal vaccine induced protective antibody response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings here have identified a previously unappreciated role for nasal bacteria in the induction of the virus-specific adaptive immune responses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Age-dependent pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. The sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy people is not significantly different among age groups, but persons age 65\u2009years or older had strikingly higher COVID-19 mortality compared to younger individuals. To understand COVID-19 manifestations in patients of different ages, ferrets in three age groups were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from all ferrets regardless of age, aged ferrets (\u22653 years old) showed higher viral load, longer nasal virus shedding, and more severe lung inflammatory cell infiltration and clinical symptom compared to \u22646 months juvenile and 1-2 years young adult groups. Transcriptome analysis of aged ferret lungs revealed strong enrichment of gene sets related to type I interferon, activated T cell, and M1 macrophage responses, mimicking the gene expression profile of severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged ferrets highly recapitulate COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and are useful for understanding an age-associated infection, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVES: To determine the motivators and barriers to COVID-19 convalescent plasma donation by those in the United Kingdom who have been diagnosed with or who have had symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) but who have not donated., BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma from people recovered from COVID-19 with sufficient antibody titres is a potential option for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. However, to date, recruiting and retaining COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors has been challenging. Understanding why those eligible to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma have not donated is critical to developing recruitment campaigns., METHODS/MATERIALS: A total of 419 UK residents who indicated that they had been infected with COVID-19 and who lived within 50 km of sites collecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma completed an online survey between 25th June and 5th July 2020. Respondents completed items assessing their awareness of convalescent plasma, motivations and barriers to donation and intention to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma., RESULTS: Awareness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was low. Exploratory factor analysis identified six motivations and seven barriers to donating. A stronger sense of altruism through adversity and moral and civic duty were positively related to intention to donate, whereas generic donation fears was negatively related., CONCLUSIONS: Once potential donors are aware of convalescent plasma, interventions should focus on the gratitude and reciprocity that those eligible to donate feel, along with a focus on (potentially) helping family and norms of what people ought to do. Fears associated with donation should not be neglected, and strategies that have been successfully used tor recruit whole-blood donors should be adapted and deployed to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with =35 million cases, and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest., OBJECTIVE: To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined., RESULTS: Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or >=3 x upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs., CONCLUSION: LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin >=1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among asymptomatic patients admitted to hospital has implications for personal protective equipment use, testing strategy and confidence in the safety of acute care services. Our aim was to estimate the positivity rate of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing among people admitted to hospital without symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Alberta, Canada., METHODS: Between Apr. 9 and May 24, 2020, we screened for COVID-19 symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in all consecutive adult patients (>= 18 yr) admitted via emergency department to 3 Alberta hospitals. We summarized the parameters of the epidemic curve and assessed the performance of symptom screening versus RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples., RESULTS: The study period encompassed Alberta's initial epidemic curve, with peak active cases per 100 000 of 71.4 (0.07%) on Apr. 30, 2020, and 14.7 and 14.6 at the beginning (Apr. 9, 2020) and end (May 24, 2020), respectively. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (64.9% throat and 35.1% nasopharyngeal swabs) was done on 3375 adults (mean age 51, standard deviation 21, yr; 51.5% men). None of the asymptomatic patients (n = 1814) tested positive, and 71 of those with symptoms tested positive (n = 1561; 4.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6%-5.7%). Sensitivity of symptom screening (v. RT-PCR) was 100% (95% CI 95%-100%), and specificity was 55% (95% CI 53%-57%). Posttest probabilities for prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranging from 1.5 to 14 times the peak prevalence of active cases during the study did not change when we assumed lower sensitivity (92%)., INTERPRETATION: In a region with low disease prevalence where protocolized symptom assessment was in place during the admission process, we did not identify people admitted to hospital without COVID-19 symptoms who were RT-PCR positive. There may not be additive benefit to universal testing of asymptomatic patients on hospital admission in a setting of low pretest probability and strong public health containment.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between the dynamic changes of serum 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG and immunity alteration for patients after 6-month hospital discharge., METHODS: One IgM(+) and IgG(-), 32 IgM(+) and IgG(+), 38 IgM(-) and IgG(+), and 40 IgM(-) and IgG(-) patients were included. Demographic data were collected. IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4., RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(-) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(-) and IgG(-) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(-), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4., CONCLUSIONS: The changes of serum IgM and IgG are closely related to immunity in patients in the recovery stage. However, immunity does not recover when the patients test negative for these antibodies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2-induced impaired immune response by Prostaglandin E2 is accelerated by age, male sex and air pollution. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has led to a pandemic with millions of people affected. The present study finds prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) blood levels elevated in COVID-19 patients with positive correlation with disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 induces PGE2 generation and secretion in infected lung epithelial cells by upregulating cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and reducing the PG-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase. Also living human-lung-precision-slices infected with SARS-CoV-2 display upregulated COX-2. PGE2 in serum of COVID-19 patients lowers the expression of Paired-Box-Protein-Pax-5 (PAX5), a master regulator of B-cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, in both human and mouse pre-B-cells, while the PGE2 inhibitor taxifolin directly reduces SARS-CoV-2-induced PGE2 production and attenuates viral replication. Risk-factors for severe disease courses, i.e. older age, male sex and air pollution are associated with higher PGE2 production and lower PAX5 expression in pre-B-cells. Since PGE2 acts broadly immunosuppressive its elevation might reduce the early anti-viral defense and its inhibition may therefore reduce severe disease courses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

(COMVIVIR, clinicaltrials.gov NCT04475991). <h4>Background: </h4> : Multiple studies have now established that hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS CoV-2 is a main cause of complications and death in infected subjects. Such dysfunctional immune response has been described as a dysregulated and exacerbated production of cytokines and chemokines that attracts and activates inflammatory cells, which start and sustain pulmonary and systemic damage, thus causing complications that lead to multi organ failure and death. Therefore, we suggest that blocking key inflammation receptors could help to reduce migration and activation of Th17, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, thus mitigating the cytokine storm and averting severe complications and death. Importantly, the optimum treatment for COVID-19 severe patients could combine a modulator of the immune response with a direct antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2, in order to address both the viral load and the hyperinflammatory effects of the immune dysregulation. <h4>Methods: </h4> : Maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist, and Favipiravir (FPV), an antiviral, will be evaluated single and combined, added to the treatment currently used at the Hospital General de M\u00e9xico for severe non-critical COVID-19 patients.

Background: This study aimed to determine parameters for worsening oxygenation in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia., Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as those with SpO2 <= 94%, or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening group who were without any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest CT were calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist., Results: We included 136 patients with 32 (23.5%) in the worsening oxygenation group, of whom two needed MV and one died. Initial vital signs and duration of symptoms showed no difference between the two groups, however, univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a variety of parameters at admission were associated with an increased risk of a desaturation event. A subset of patients were studied to eliminate potential bias, that ferritin >= 280 mug/L (p=0.029), LDH >= 240 U/L (p=0.029), pneumonia volume (p=0.021), and extent (p=0.030) by AI, and visual severity scores (p=0.042) were the predictive parameters for worsening oxygenation in a sex-, age-, and comorbid illness-matched case-control study using propensity score (n=52)., Conclusion: Our study presents initial CT evaluated by AI or visual severity scoring as well as serum markers of inflammation at admission are significantly associated with worsening oxygenation in this COVID-19 pneumonia cohort.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Lipid-based vaccine nanoparticles for induction of humoral immune responses against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The current health crisis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the urgent need for vaccine systems that can generate potent and protective immune responses. Protein vaccines are safe, but conventional approaches for protein-based vaccines often fail to elicit potent and long-lasting immune responses. Nanoparticle vaccines designed to co-deliver protein antigens and adjuvants can promote their delivery to antigen-presenting cells and improve immunogenicity. However, it remains challenging to develop vaccine nanoparticles that can preserve and present conformational epitopes of protein antigens for induction of neutralizing antibody responses. Here, we have designed a new lipid-based nanoparticle vaccine platform (NVP) that presents viral proteins (HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 antigens) in a conformational manner for induction of antigen-specific antibody responses. We show that NVP was readily taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promoted DC maturation and antigen presentation. NVP loaded with BG505.SOSIP.664 (SOSIP) or SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was readily recognized by neutralizing antibodies, indicating the conformational display of antigens on the surfaces of NVP. Rabbits immunized with SOSIP-NVP elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1. Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD-NVP induced robust and long-lasting antibody responses against RBD from SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that NVP is a promising platform technology for vaccination against infectious pathogens. Copyright \u00a9 2020.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and viral shedding kinetics of asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The data of 38 asymptomatic patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were collected from February to March 2020 in Tuanfeng County, Huanggang, Hubei, China. The epidemiology, laboratory examination, chest imaging, viral nucleic acid test results, clinical characteristics, and viral shedding time were summarized in this retrospective study. The study included 20 family members of patients with COVID-19, 10 medical personnel participating in COVID-19 treatment or working in a fever clinic, 6 personnel from quarantine places, 1 individual with a close contact history with confirmed patients, and 1 local epidemic prevention personnel. All were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The white blood cell (WBC) count, the absolute value of lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer were normal. Pneumonia manifestations were not found in the chest computed tomography (CT) scan of 36 patients; the remaining 2 cases included a 1-year-old child and a pregnant woman, and they did not undergo chest CT. The viral shedding time was 6 days.All asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 had a history of close contact or exposure. Laboratory tests were normal. Chest imaging did not show any pneumonia manifestation. The viral shedding time was <10 days, which is shorter than that of patients with COVID-19. A timely discovery of such asymptomatic infections is crucial for blocking the spread of the virus and strengthening the prevention and control measures. Copyright \u00a9 2020 the Author(s).

{"text": "Genomic Diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 in Turkey and the Impact of Virus Genome Mutations on Clinical Outcomes. <h4>Summary</h4> COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Global efforts of genomic surveillance of the virus give chance to track the spread of the pandemic. Global emergence of some viral mutations called attention and various studies have been suggested about increased infectivity of the virus. Herein, we sequenced viral genomes isolated from 184 patients in Istanbul and analyzed clinical metadata for the investigation of any viral mutation which affects the disease course of the host. We did not detect any viral mutations affecting the disease outcome in our cohort. Besides, we observed intra-host mutations in 76% of the isolates. Insertion/deletion and stop-gain mutations are also significantly less common among intra-host variants compared to consensus viral genome mutations. Longitudinal genomic surveillance is essential for timely detection of any lineages that might affect clinical outcome, the performance of diagnostic assays, or even the immunological escape of the virus.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "European context of the diversity and phylogenetic position of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Polish COVID-19 patients. To provide a comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity in Poland in the European context. All publicly available (n = 115; GISAID database) whole-genome SARS-Cov-2 sequences from Polish samples, including those obtained during coronavirus testing performed in our COVID-19 Lab, were examined. Multiple sequence alignment of Polish isolates, phylogenetic analysis (ML tree), and multidimensional scaling (based on the pairwise DNA distances) were complemented by the comparison of the coronavirus clades frequency and diversity in the subset of over 5000 European GISAID sequences. Approximately seventy-seven percent of isolates in the European dataset carried frequent and ubiquitously found haplotypes; the remaining haplotype diversity was population-specific and resulted from population-specific mutations, homoplasies, and recombinations. Coronavirus strains circulating in Poland represented the variability found in other European countries. The prevalence of clades circulating in Poland was shifted in favor of GR, both in terms of the diversity (number of distinct haplotypes) and the frequency (number of isolates) of the clade. Polish-specific haplotypes were rare and could be explained by changes affecting common European strains. The analysis of the whole viral genomes allowed detection of several tight clusters of isolates, presumably reflecting local outbreaks. New mutations, homoplasies, and, to a smaller extent, recombinations increase SARS-CoV-2 haplotype diversity, but the majority of these variants do not increase in frequency and remains rare and population-specific. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in the Polish dataset reflects many independent transfers from a variety of sources, followed by many local outbreaks. The prevalence of the sequences belonging to the GR clade among Polish isolates is consistent with the European trend of the GR clade frequency increase.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Aims: To compare the early impact of COVID-19 infections and mortality from February to July 2020 across the Nordic nations of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland through available public data sources and conduct a descriptive analysis of the potential factors that drove different epidemiological outcomes, with a focus on Sweden's response. Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions : COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines.

Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey ( N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine ( n = 1155).

{"text": "Inferring Toll-Like Receptor induced epitope subunit vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2: A Reverse Vaccinology approach. Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) are a group of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) which bind to the exogenous pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like other PRRs; hence the main function is to sense the harmness and mediate the innate immune response to pathogens. TLRs play an important role in innate immune responses to infection. The host has evolved to use other TLR and PAMP agonists as agents to stimulate a protective inflammatory immune response against infection. Because only a small number of doses are given, TLR agonists appear to have greater potential and fewer safety concerns than other uses as vaccine adjuvants. In the present days, development of peptides targeting immune response can be approved for survival in biological monitoring systems before vaccine exposures. Peptide vaccines are easy to synthesize, more stable and relatively safe. In addition, production of peptides becomes simple, easily reproducible, fast and cost effective. Getting vaccinated against Covid-19, which has become a pandemic in the human population, is the most practical way to control the outbreak. The new coronavirus does not contain a drug or vaccine to prevent it from spreading to humans. To getting a proper vaccine candidate against the novel coronavirus, the present study used the reverse vaccinology approach by using a complete set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; such as: Spike, Envelope, Nucleocapsid, Membrane, NSPs, and ORFs to extract the antigenic elements that produce B-cell, T-cell and IFN positive epitopes. These epitopes with precise binding to the Toll-Like receptors (1-10) have developed epitope based vaccine candidates. We have prioritized a set of epitopes based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, sequence conservation and projected population coverage world-wide. The selected epitopes were employed for in-silico docking interactions with Toll-Like receptors and molecular dynamic simulation confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidates resulting epitope of spike proteins with both the TLR 7 and 8 shows the best binding affinity. We believe that this ideal epitope vaccine candidate could enhance the immune response of the host and reduce the reinfection risk.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Although this is a plausible hypothesis, there is no evidence that complications or mortality rates in neuromuscular patients are higher than in the general population. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders., METHODS: A registry of children with neuromuscular conditions and laboratory-confirmed-SARS-CoV-2 infection was set up by the Neuromuscular Working Group of the Spanish Pediatric Neurology Society (SENEP).

The prevalence of never/rarely washing hands after using the toilet (10.8%) or with soap (14.3%) was particularly high in low-income countries. Severe food insecurity was associated with 1.34 (95%CI = 1.25-1.43), 1.61 (95%CI = 1.50-1.73), and 1.44 (95%CI = 1.35-1.53) times higher odds for never/rarely washing hands before eating, after using the toilet, and with soap, respectively. A high prevalence of inadequate hand washing practices was reported, particularly in low-income countries and those with severe food insecurity. In light of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid expansion being observed in low- and middle-income locations, interventions that disseminate good hand-washing practices are urgently required. Such interventions may also have cross-over benefits in relation to other poor sanitation-related diseases.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Comprehensive mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human serum antibodies. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike\u2019s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD\u2019s receptor binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Performance of at-home self-collected saliva and nasal-oropharyngeal swabs in the surveillance of COVID-19. Background: SARS-CoV-2 quickly spreads in the worldwide population, imposing social restrictions to control the infection, being the massive testing another essential strategy to break the chain of transmission. Aim: To compare the performance of at-home self-collected samples - saliva and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) - for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a telemedicine platform for COVID-19 surveillance. Material and methods: We analyzed 201 patients who met the criteria of suspected COVID-19. NOP sampling was combined (nostrils and oropharynx) and saliva collected using a cotton pad device. Detection of SARS-COV-2 was performed by using the Altona RealStar R SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0. Results: There was an overall significant agreement (kappa coefficient value of 0.58) between saliva and NOP. Considering results in either sample, 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva. Conclusion: Our data show the feasibility of using at-home self-collected samples (especially saliva), as an adequate alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This new approach of testing can be useful to develop strategies for COVID-19 surveillance and for guiding public health decisions. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

{"text": "COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy in the United States: A Rapid National Assessment. Given the results from early trials, COVID-19 vaccines will be available by 2021. However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelor's degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originated in Wuhan (China) rapidly turned into a pandemic. Due to a national compulsive decree of quarantine, office visits for chronic disease control were delay. Hypopituitarism includes all clinical conditions that result in partial or complete failure of the pituitary gland's ability to secrete hormones. Pituitary insufficiency per se has been associated with an increase in both morbidity and mortality, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity., OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with hypopituitarism, discuss the implications of the treatments the patient was taking and grade up the value of telemedicine in the present scenario., METHODS: Report of the clinical record of a patient with hypopituitarism and infection with SARS-CoV-2., RESULTS: During the span of the infection, the patient remained on the same hormonal therapeutic scheme (thyroid, gonadal and adrenal axis). The dose of hydrocortisone was not changed during the course of the infection as she was asymptomatic. We use telemedicine to control and advise her on the treatment., CONCLUSION: Health care professionals should carefully follow up on the evolution of patients with hypopituitarism to provide them a safer outcome.

The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on the background of COVID-19 is especially actual due to the prevalence of this pathology and the possible aggravation of the pathological process. The aim of our study was to improve the principles of CAP diagnostics on the background of COVID-19 and to determine risk factors for aggravating of the pathological process. Patients with respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 were examined. General clinical research methods were carried out, determination of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA by PCR method, computer tomography (CT) to identify the features of lung tissue damage was performed. The main observation group consisted of 37 patients (men-19 (51.4%), average age-61 (57; 69) years) with pneumonia on the background of confirmed COVID-19. According to the severity of coronavirus disease, all patients of the main group were divided into 3 subgroups: subgroup 1 included 17 people with moderate COVID-19, subgroup 2-13 people with severe COVID-19, subgroup 3-7 people with critical COVID-19 course. The levels of markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein (C-RP) and fibrinogen) were also determined. Since patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity (which is characterized by the presence of community-acquired viral pneumonia) belong to the risk group of severe and critical course, it is suggested to consider the following risk factors for aggravating the pathological process as: temperature over 38.5 degrees C, heart rate over 90 per minute, respiratory rate over 20 per minute, SpO(2) <= 93%; absolute lymphopenia (less than 0.9 G/L) and an increase in serum levels of C-RP more than 50 mg/L and fibrinogen more than 5 g/L.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Religious Support as a Contribution to Face the Effects of Social Isolation in Mental Health During the Pandemic of COVID-19. Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation. However, this and other factors have caused mental health problems, both in patients and health professionals and in family members or asymptomatic population. Religious support can be an ally for this type of confrontation. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual/religious care has been restricted and insufficient. When accessible to patients and frontline professionals, they are offered by virtual means, almost always by recorded media and made available in bulk. This essay argues, based on references in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, biosafety, and military, that the face-to-face and personalized relationship between religious leaders, patients, health professionals, family members, and faith communities is as essential as possible for the dignified treatment victims, referral to spiritual needs and resilience of society, in addition to contributing to the improvement of the immune response of all. Practical examples are cited in the areas of military chaplaincy and hospital civilian chaplaincy. The essay also proposes the adoption of protocols already published by WHO and other safety measures such as the use of robotics and the recruitment/training of mass chaplains. In addition to contributing to the improvement of COVID-19 pandemic coping processes, the study also contributes to improving the delivery of spiritual/religious care as an ally to physical and mental, individual, and collective health.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Importance: Estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease burden are needed to help guide interventions., Objective: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16596], May, June, and July [n = 40817], and August [n = 38355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers., Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden., Results: Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16596), May (n = 14291), June (n = 14159), July (n = 12367), and August (n = 38355), there were estimated medians of 46910006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38192705-60814748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28122752 (IQR, 23014957-36438592) symptomatic infections, 956174 (IQR, 782509-1238912) hospitalizations, and 304915 (IQR, 248253-395296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020., Conclusions and Relevance: The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity.

{"text": "Clinical features and radiological manifestations of COVID-19 disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered after unusual cases of severe pneumonia emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan Province (China). Coronavirus is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted from person to person. Although asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus, symptomatic patients are more contagious. The incubation period ranges from 3-7 d and symptoms are mainly respiratory, including pneumonia or pulmonary embolism in severe cases. Elevated serum levels of interleukins (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7 indicate the presence of cytokine release syndrome, which is associated with disease severity. The disease has three main phases: Viral infection, pulmonary involvement, and hyperinflammation. To date, no treatment has proved to be safe or effective. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) are the primary imaging tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, follow-up, and detection of complications. The main radiological findings are ground-glass opacification and areas of consolidation. The long-term clinical course is unknown, although some patients may develop pulmonary fibrosis. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is useful to assess pulmonary involvement, to define the affected areas, and to assess treatment response. The pathophysiology and clinical course of COVID-19 infection remain poorly understood. However, patterns detected on CT and PET-CT may help to diagnose and guide treatment. In this mini review, we analyze the clinical manifestations and radiological findings of COVID-19 infection. Copyright \u00a9The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

{"text": "Impact of Relaxing Covid-19 Social Distancing Measures on Rural North Wales: A Simulation Analysis. Background: Social distancing policies aimed to limit Covid-19 across the UK were gradually relaxed between May and August 2020, as peak incidences passed. Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the timing of peak Covid-19 mortality rate in rural North Wales. Methods: Covid-19 related mortality data up to 7/5/2020 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality to 24/8/2020. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage of predicted mortality at 24/8/2020 were calculated. Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07/05/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales on 07/05/2020 represents 33% of the number predicted to occur by 24/08/2020, compared with 74 and 62% for Wales and the UK, respectively. Conclusion:  Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas-principally rural in nature-where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and in popular holiday destinations.

{"text": "MVA Vector Vaccines Inhibit SARS CoV-2 Replication in Upper and Lower Respiratory Tracts of Transgenic Mice and Prevent Lethal Disease. Replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a licensed smallpox vaccine and numerous clinical studies investigating recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) as vectors for prevention of other infectious diseases have been completed or are in progress. Two rMVA COVID-19 vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported. Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was abortive in immunized animals. <h4>Significance</h4> Vaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards. Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials, though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity. The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer. In a transgenic mouse model, one or two injections of recombinant MVAs that express modified forms of S inhibited CoV-2 replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and prevented severe disease.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Relaxation of social distancing restrictions: Model estimated impact on COVID-19 epidemic in Manitoba, Canada. OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic., METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year., RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4-6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31-38% of the population, within 3-4 months of initial relaxation., CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Managing pandemics Demands, resources, and effective behaviors within crisis management teams. Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 crisis, are very complex emergencies that can neither be handled by individuals nor by any single municipality, organization or even country alone. Such situations require multidisciplinary crisis management teams (CMTs) at different administrative levels. However, most existing CMTs are trained for rather local and temporary emergencies but not for international and long-lasting crises. Moreover, CMT members in a pandemic face additional demands due to unknown characteristics of the disease and a highly volatile environment. To support and ensure the effectiveness of CMTs, we need to understand how CMT members can successfully cope with these multiple demands. Connecting teamwork research with the job demands and resources approach as starting framework, we conducted structured interviews and critical incident analyses with 144 members of various CMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Content analyses revealed both perceived demands as well as perceived resources in CMTs. Moreover, structuring work processes, open, precise and regular communication, and anticipatory, goal-oriented and fast problem solving were described as particularly effective behaviors in CMTs. We illustrate our findings in an integrated model and derive practical recommendations for the work and future training of CMTs. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Notably, a series solution of the incidence variable of the model is derived. It is proven that the explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new transcendental special function, which is a solution of a non-elementary integral equation. The paper introduces iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows for estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases.

The study included 34 patients (23 males; mean age 60.2+/-16.6 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Besides standard medical examination the AHA blood levels were observed, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA), anti-cardiomyocyte antibodies (AbC), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) and cardiac conducting tissue antibodies (CCTA). Median hospital length of stay was 14 [13; 18] days. AHA levels were increased in 25 (73.5%) patients. Significant correlation (p<0.05) of AHA levels with cardiovascular manifestations (r = 0.459) was found. AbC levels correlated with pneumonia severity (r = 0.472), respiratory failure (r = 0.387), need for invasive ventilation (r = 0.469), chest pain (r = 0.374), low QRS voltage (r = 0.415) and levels of CRP (r = 0.360) and LDH (r = 0.360). ASMA levels were found to correlate with atrial fibrillation (r = 0.414, p<0.05). ANA and AbC levels correlated with pericardial effusion (r = 0.721 and r = 0.745 respectively, p<0.05). The lethality rate was 8.8%. AbC and ASMA levels correlated significantly with lethality (r = 0.363, and r = 0.426 respectively, p<0.05) and were prognostically important.

This study is a quantitative analysis investigating the educational and psychological effects of the pandemic on US medical students and their reactions to the AAMC recommendation in order to inform medical education policy., METHODS: The authors sent a cross-sectional survey via email to medical students in their clinical training years at six medical schools during the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey questions aimed to evaluate students' perceptions of COVID-19's impact on medical education; ethical obligations during a pandemic; infection risk; anxiety and burnout; willingness and needed preparations to return to clinical rotations., RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-one (29.5%) students responded. Nearly all students (93.7%) were not involved in clinical rotations with in-person patient contact at the time the study was conducted. Reactions to being removed were mixed, with 75.8% feeling this was appropriate, 34.7% guilty, 33.5% disappointed, and 27.0% relieved. Most students (74.7%) agreed the pandemic had significantly disrupted their medical education, and believed they should continue with normal clinical rotations during this pandemic (61.3%). When asked if they would accept the risk of infection with COVID-19 if they returned to the clinical setting, 83.4% agreed. Students reported the pandemic had moderate effects on their stress and anxiety levels with 84.1% of respondents feeling at least somewhat anxious. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (53.5%) was the most important factor to feel safe returning to clinical rotations, followed by adequate testing for infection (19.3%) and antibody testing (16.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education of US medical students in their clinical training years. The majority of students wanted to return to clinical rotations and were willing to accept the risk of COVID-19 infection. Students were most concerned with having enough PPE if allowed to return to clinical activities.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Self-protection strategies and health behaviour in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: results and predictors in more than 12 000 patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases followed in the Danish DANBIO registry. AIMS: In Danish patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases to explore self-protection strategies and health behaviour including adherence to disease-modifying antirheumatic treatment (DMARD) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and again after the reopening of the society started. Furthermore, to identify characteristics of patients with high levels of anxiety and self-isolation., METHODS: Patients in routine care followed prospectively in the nationwide DANBIO registry were invited to answer an online questionnaire regarding disease activity and COVID-19 infection, behaviour in March and June 2020. Responses were linked to patient data in DANBIO. Characteristics potentially associated with anxiety, self-isolation and medication adherence (gender/age/diagnosis/education/work status/comorbidity/DMARD/smoking/EQ-5D/disease activity) were explored with multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: We included 12 789 patients (8168 rheumatoid arthritis/2068 psoriatic arthritis/1758 axial spondyloarthritis/795 other) of whom 65% were women and 36% treated with biological DMARD. Self-reported COVID-19 prevalence was 0.3%. Patients reported that they were worried to get COVID-19 infection (March/June: 70%/45%) and self-isolated more than others of the same age (48%/38%). The fraction of patients who changed medication due to fear of COVID-19 were 4.1%/0.6%. Female gender, comorbidities, not working, lower education, biological treatment and poor European Quality of life, 5 dimensions were associated with both anxiety and self-isolation., CONCLUSION: In >12 000 patients with inflammatory arthritis, we found widespread anxiety and self-isolation, but high medication adherence, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This persisted during the gradual opening of society during the following months. Attention to patients' anxiety and self-isolation is important during this and potential future epidemics.

{"text": "Safety and immunogenicity clinical trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 (a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial) and the persistence of immune responses from a phase 1 follow-up report. <h4>Background</h4> BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 \u00b5g or 6 \u00b5g) formulated with a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG). Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152: 3 \u00b5g and 6 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG and 6 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion (\u22654-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT 50 ). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose). <h4>Findings</h4> Among 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT 50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92\u00b79% (88\u00b72, 96\u00b72) and 98\u00b73% (95\u00b71, 99\u00b76) in the 3 \u00b5g and 6 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6\u00b79, 13\u00b72) and 10.3% (7\u00b74, 13\u00b78) in the 3 \u00b5g and 6 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73\u00b75% (63\u00b76, 81\u00b79), 81\u00b71% (71\u00b74, 88\u00b71), and 73\u00b71% (62\u00b79, 81\u00b78) of individuals in the 3 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG, 6 \u00b5g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 \u00b5g with Algel groups, respectively. <h4>Interpretation</h4> In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates. The 6 \u00b5g Algel-IMDG formulation was selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. <h4>Funding</h4> This work was supported and funded by Bharat Biotech International Limited.

{"text": "Peripheral Blood Immune Profiling of Convalescent Plasma Donors Reveals Alterations in Specific Immune Subpopulations Even at 2 Months Post SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Immune profiling of patients with COVID-19 has shown that SARS-CoV-2 causes severe lymphocyte deficiencies (e.g., lymphopenia, decreased numbers, and exhaustion of T cells) and increased levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes. Peripheral blood (PB) samples from convalescent plasma (CP) donors, COVID-19 patients, and control subjects were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, allowing the identification of a wide panel of immune cells, comprising lymphocytes (T, B, natural killer (NK) and NKT cells), monocytes, granulocytes, and their subsets. Compared to active COVID-19 patients, our results revealed that the immune profile of recovered donors was restored for most subpopulations. Nevertheless, even 2 months after recovery, CP donors still had reduced levels of CD4+ T and B cells, as well as granulocytes. CP donors with non-detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in their serum were characterized by higher Th9 and Th17 cells, which were possibly expanded at the expense of Th2 humoral immunity. The most noticeable alterations were identified in previously hospitalized CP donors, who presented the lowest levels of CD8+ regulatory T cells, the highest levels of CD56+CD16- NKT cells, and a promotion of a Th17-type phenotype, which might be associated with a prolonged pro-inflammatory response. A longer follow-up of CP donors will eventually reveal the time needed for full recovery of their immune system competence.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Nutritional Risk Screening and Body Composition in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in an Internal Medicine Ward. Background: Malnutrition in patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards is highly prevalent and represents a prognostic factor of worse outcomes. Previous evidence suggested the prognostic role of the nutritional status in patients affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to investigate the nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in an internal medicine ward and their clinical outcomes using the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) and parameters derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)., Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 aimed at exploring: 1) the prevalence of nutritional risk with NRS-2002 and BIA; 2) the relationship between NRS-2002, BIA parameters and selected outcomes: length of hospital stay (LOS); death and need of intensive care unit (ICU); prolonged LOS; and loss of appetite., Results: Data of 90 patients were analyzed. Patients at nutritional risk were 92% with NRS-2002, with BIA-derived parameters: 88% by phase angle; 86% by body cell mass; 84% by fat-free mass and 84% by fat mass (p-value <=0.001). In ROC analysis, NRS had the maximum sensitivity in predicting the risk of death and need of ICU and a prolonged hospitalization showing moderate-low specificity; phase angle showed a good predictive power in terms of AUC. NRS-2002 was significantly associated with LOS (beta 12.62, SE 5.79). In a multivariate analysis, blood glucose level and the early warning score are independent predictors of death and need of ICU (OR 2.79, p <=0.001; 1.59, p-0.029, respectively)., Conclusion: Present findings confirm the clinical utility of NRS-2002 to assess nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission and in predicting LOS, and that bioimpedance does not seem to add further predictive value. An early detection of nutritional risk has to be systematically included in the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in internal medicine wards.

The main objective was to assess clinical and laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE., METHODS: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset, were compared between PE and non-PE patients., RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD 13.7) vs 69.9 (SD 12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD 8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). No patients met ISTH DIC criteria. Any parameter was statistically significant or clinically relevant except for D-Dimer when comparing both groups. Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p = 0.004); week 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p = 0.003); and week 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p = 0.01).

Here we discuss the potential role of plant molecular farming in the rapid and scalable supply of protein antigens as reagents and vaccine candidates, antibodies for virus detection and passive immunotherapy, other therapeutic proteins, and virus-like particles as novel vaccine platforms. We calculate the amount of infrastructure and production capacity needed to deal with predictable subsequent waves of COVID-19 in Italy by pooling expertise in plant molecular farming, epidemiology and the Italian health system. We calculate the investment required in molecular farming infrastructure that would enable us to capitalize on this technology, and provide a roadmap for the development of diagnostic reagents and biopharmaceuticals using molecular farming in plants to complement production methods based on the cultivation of microbes and mammalian cells.

BACKGROUND: People with disabilities face multiple barriers that prevent them from accessing care and essential information related to the COVID-19 pandemic that poses additional stress and psychopathology. Therefore, the investigation of psychopathologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and emergency response is critical., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 scale, insomnia severity index-7, and brief resilient coping scale were administered to participants. The collected data was then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical procedures were employed to describe the various psychopathologies. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value <0.05 was declared as statistically significant., RESULTS: A significant proportion of individuals living with disability had psychopathologies; 46.2% for depression symptoms, 48.1% for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and 71% for insomnia symptoms. Nearly 45.7% of participants were low resilient copers to their psychopathology.

Four commercial immunoassays were analyzed and validated: anti-IgG ARCHITECT R (Abbott), anti-Total antibodies (Ab) VITROS R (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), anti-IgG NovaLisa R (NovaTec Immundiagnostica) and Healgen R IgM and IgG (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech). Sensitivities were evaluated according to days post-symptoms onset (pso). Specificities were evaluated on SARS-CoV-2-negative control sera collected before January 2020., RESULTS: A majority of severe-to-critically ill patients showed detectable Ab already at day 14 and sensitivities reached 100 % after 22 days pso. For patients with \"mild-to-moderate\" illness, sensitivities increased by at least 5-fold from day 0 to day 14 pso.

{"text": "On the increasing role of older adolescents and younger adults during the SARSCoV2 epidemic in Mexico. BACKGROUND: During the first months of the SARSCoV2 pandemic, Mexico implemented a national lockdown followed by post lockdown mitigation., METHODS: We used daily number of SARSCoV2-confirmed hospitalizations (by date of symptom onset) to assess the changes in the incidence of individuals between the age of 10-59 years during the epidemic in Mexico. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in that age group among all cases aged 10-59y during the early lockdown period (April 20 to May 3, 2020), and the corresponding proportion L(g) during the late lockdown period (May 18 to 31, 2020) and post-lockdown mitigation (June 15 to 28, 2020). For each later period (late lockdown or post lockdown), we computed the proportion ratios relative to the early lockdown period PR(g)=L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)> PR(g2) is interpreted as a relative increase in SARSCoV2 infections in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the late lockdown and post lockdown periods vs. the early lockdown period., RESULTS: For the late lockdown period, the highest PR estimates belong to persons aged 15-19y (PR=1.69(95%CI(1.05, 2.72))) and 20 to 24y (PR=1.43(1.10,1.86)). For the post lockdown period, the highest PR estimates were also in age groups 15 to 19y (PR=2.05(1.30, 3.24)) and 20-24y (PR=1.49(1.15,1.93)). These estimates were higher in persons 15 to 24y compared to those greater or equal than 30y., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adolescents and younger adults had an increased relative incidence during late lockdown and the post-lockdown mitigation periods. The role of these age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future pandemic response efforts.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

SARS-CoV-2 infections raise many practical concerns in a woman with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the perinatal period. On the other hand, the impact of COVID-19 on patients with MS and disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is unknown. We report on a female patient who was treated with interferon beta 1a (IFNB-1a) for many years for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) until December 2018. She developed COVID 19 infection in April 2020, after giving birth to a healthy baby girl, five weeks before. She developed a mild right hemiparesis 2 weeks later, without cold symptoms. On admission, PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and she received antivirals and corticotherapy. One month later, specific IgG and IgM antibodies were negative.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with Covid-19 infection is uncertain. We derived and validated a new risk model for predicting progression to disease severity, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality in patients with Covid-19 infection (Gal-Covid-19 scores)., METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with Covid-19 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Galicia, Spain. Data were extracted from electronic health records of patients, including age, sex and comorbidities according to International Classification of Primary Care codes (ICPC-2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of disease severity. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated to assess model performance., RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 0.39% (10 454 patients). A total of 2492 patients (23.8%) required hospitalization, 284 (2.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 544 (5.2%) died. The variables included in the models to predict severity included age, gender and chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, chronic kidney disease and haematological cancer. The models demonstrated a fair-good fit for predicting hospitalization {AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve] 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 0.78]}, admission to ICU [AUC 0.83 (95%CI 0.81, 0.85)] and death [AUC 0.89 (95%CI 0.88, 0.90)]., CONCLUSIONS: The Gal-Covid-19 scores provide risk estimates for predicting severity in Covid-19 patients.

We assessed the risk of COVID-19 infection in a healthcare worker (HCW) from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a health-care setting of short distance of 0.6 m between the HCW and a patient while caring, and evaluated the effectiveness of a face mask and a face shield using a model that combined previous infection-risk models. The multiple pathways of exposure included hand contact via contaminated surfaces and an HCW's fingers with droplets, droplet spray, and inhalation of inspirable and respirable particles. We assumed a scenario of medium contact time (MCT) and long contact time (LCT) over 1 day of care by an HCW. SARS-CoV-2 in the particles emitted by coughing, breathing, and vocalization (only in the LCT scenario) by the patient were considered. The contribution of the risk of infection of an HCW by SARS-CoV-2 from each pathway to the sum of the risks from all pathways depended on virus concentration in the saliva of the patient. At a virus concentration in the saliva of 101-105 PFU mL-1 concentration in the MCT scenario and 101-104 PFU mL-1 concentration in the LCT scenario, droplet spraying was the major pathway (60%-86%) of infection, followed by hand contact via contaminated surfaces (9%-32%). At a high virus concentration in the saliva (106-108 PFU mL-1 in the MCT scenario and 105-108 PFU mL-1 in the LCT scenario), hand contact via contaminated surfaces was the main contributor (41%-83%) to infection. The contribution of inhalation of inspirable particles was 4%-10% in all assumed cases. The contribution of inhalation of respirable particles increased as the virus concentration in the saliva increased, and reached 5%-27% at the high saliva concentration (107 and 108 PFU mL-1) in the assumed scenarios using higher dose-response function parameter (0.246) and comparable to other pathways, although these were worst and rare cases. Regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, the relative risk (RR) of an overall risk for an HCW with an intervention vs. an HCW without intervention was 0.36-0.37, 0.02-0.03, and <4.0 x 10-4 for a face mask, a face shield, and a face mask plus shield, respectively, in the likely median virus concentration in the saliva (102-104 PFU mL-1), suggesting that personal protective equipment decreased the infection risk by 63%->99.9%. In addition, the RR for a face mask worn by the patient, and a face mask worn by the patient plus increase of air change rate from 2 h-1 to 6 h-1 was <1.0 x 10-4 and <5.0 x 10-5, respectively in the same virus concentration in the saliva. Therefore, by modeling multiple pathways of exposure, the contribution of the infection risk from each pathway and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 were indicated quantitatively, and the importance of the use of a face mask and shield was confirmed.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has escalated the burden of psychological distress. We aimed to evaluate factors associated with psychological distress among the predominantly general population during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and World Health Organization COVID-19 databases (Dec 2019-15 July 2020). We included cross-sectional studies that reported factors associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Random-effects models were used to pool odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42020186735)., FINDINGS: We included 68 studies comprising 288,830 participants from 19 countries. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% CI: 28%-39%) and 30% (26%-36%). Women versus men (OR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.29-1.71; I2 = 90.8%]), younger versus older (=35 years) adults (1.20 [1.13-1.26]; I2 = 91.7%), living in rural versus urban areas (1.13 [1.00-1.29]; I2 = 82.9%), lower versus higher socioeconomic status (e.g. lower versus higher income: 1.45 [1.24-1.69; I2 = 82.3%]) were associated with higher anxiety odds. These factors (except for residential area) were also associated with higher depression odds. Furthermore, higher COVID-19 infection risk (suspected/confirmed cases, living in hard-hit areas, having pre-existing physical or mental conditions) and longer media exposure were associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression., INTERPRETATION: One in three adults in the predominantly general population have COVID-19 related psychological distress. Concerted efforts are urgently needed for interventions in high-risk populations to reduce urban-rural, socioeconomic and gender disparities in COVID-19 related psychological distress.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and comparison with control patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. In a large-scale study, 128176 non-pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID-19 cases included in this Meta-Analysis. The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28-37) years old and 36 (34-37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID-19 as non-pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non-pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non-pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non-pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67-0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54-0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61-0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55-0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4-0.51) than non-pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground-glass opacity (57%) and in non-pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C-reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non-pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non-pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non-pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4-8.5), and mortality due to all-cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6-13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7-94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42-54]), preterm labor (25% [4-74]) and preterm birth (21% [12-34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2-5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4-30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5-3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID-19 than pregnant women without COVID-19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2-96]), fetal distress (30% [12-58]) and LBW (25% [16-37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3-16), and the rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 is 8% (4-16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible association between COVID-19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID-19 pregnant patients.

{"text": "Clinical frailty scale and mortality in COVID-19: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) endorsed clinical frailty scale (CFS) to help with decision-making. However, this recommendation lacks an evidence basis and is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the dose-response relationship between CFS and mortality in COVID-19 patients, with a goal of supplementing the evidence of its use., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from several electronic databases up until 8 September 2020. We searched for studies investigating COVID-19 patients and reported both (1) CFS and its distribution (2) CFS and its association with mortality. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated death or non-survivor. The odds ratio (ORs) will be reported per 1% increase in CFS. The potential for a non-linear relationship based on ORs of each quantitative CFS was examined using restricted cubic splines with a three-knots model., RESULTS: There were a total of 3817 patients from seven studies. Mean age was 80.3 (SD 8.2), and 53% (48-58%) were males. The pooled prevalence for CFS 1-3 was 34% (32-36%), CFS 4-6 was 42% (40-45%), and CFS 7-9 was 23% (21-25%). Each 1-point increase in CFS was associated with 12% increase in mortality (OR 1.12 (1.04, 1.20), p = 0.003; I2: 77.3%). The dose-response relationship was linear (Pnon-linearity=0.116). The funnel-plot analysis was asymmetrical; Trim-and-fill analysis by the imputation of two studies on the left side resulted in OR of 1.10 [1.03, 1.19]., CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that increase in CFS was associated with increase in mortality in a linear fashion.

OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily known as a respiratory illness; however, a wide variety of symptoms and complications of the central nervous system (CNS), such as ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) have been reported. Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with CVA to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.

Non-pharmacological interventions, such as lockdown and mass testing, remain as the mainstay of control measures for the outbreak. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of mass testing, lockdown, or a combination of both to control COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search on 11 major databases was conducted on June 8, 2020. This review is registered in Prospero (CRD420201 90546). We included primary studies written in English which investigate mass screening, lockdown, or a combination of both to control and/or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. There are four important outcomes as selected by WHO experts for their decision- making process: incident cases, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Among 623 studies, only 14 studies met our criteria. Four observational studies were rated as strong evidence and ten modelling studies were rated as moderate evidence. Based on one modelling study, mass testing reduced the total infected people compared to no mass testing. For lockdown, ten studies consistently showed that it successfully reduced the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality rate of COVID-19. A limited evidence showed that a combination of lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate compared to lockdown only. However, there is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of mass testing only. \u00a9Copyright: the Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has inflicted catastrophic damages in public health, economic and social stability-putting life globally on hold in 2020 and presumably a year more. Indonesia bears a heavy burden of the pandemic, counting the highest case prevalence and fatality rate in all of Southeast Asia. One hope remains in the groundbreaking universal effort in search of a vaccine against the causative virus SARS-CoV-2, which has shown success unparalleled in human vaccine development thus far. An array of modalities including novel techniques are being utilized as vaccine platforms, with the closest to phase III clinical trial completion being mRNA (manufactured by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer), inactivated virus (Sinovac, Sinopharm), viral vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Janssen/Johnson&Johnson, CanSino), and protein subunit (Novavax). The vaccine produced by BioNTech/Pfizer has been deployed to the public as the first ever licensed COVID-19 vaccine. In this review, we will review all of these modalities on their safety and immunogenicity, phase II/III trial results of the nine vaccine candidates and current situation as of 29 December 2020, as well as the implication for use and distribution in Indonesia.

{"text": "Telogen Effluvium Associated With COVID-19 Infection. Telogen effluvium (TE) is characterized by diffuse hair shedding two to three months after a stressor, and COVID-19 infection is potentially one such stressor. Those who were infected with the virus were under immense psychosocial and physiologic stress. We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of 552 patients who were evaluated by a Henry Ford Health System dermatologist between February 2020 and September 2020 and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We identified ten patients with TE attributed to COVID-19 infection and described their presentations as a case series. For the ten patients selected, the mean age was 48.5 years old and 90% were female. Six of the patients were Black, one Middle Eastern, and three White. On average, the hair shedding began 50 days after the first symptom of COVID-19 infection. Eighty percent of these patients were treated with antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and/or hydroxychloroquine for their COVID-19 infection and 70% were hospitalized. The presentations of these patients suggest that COVID-19 infection may be a significant trigger of TE. TE caused by hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or other medications cannot be ruled out, and the global pandemic itself is a source of psychosocial stress. Further studies will be needed to understand the long-term prevalence and prognosis of TE associated with COVID-19 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Background: The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue., Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students., Method: A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software., Result: The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students' present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety., Conclusion: A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. Poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students' mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.

{"text": "The international initiatives of the collaboration between the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association, concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all European countries were hit, but mortality rates were heterogenous, with some countries being hit very hard, while others including Greece had a much lower death rate during the first wave of spring 2020. The ultra-fast application of measures was probably the reason of this outstanding success. This outbreak is expected to trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress, as responses to an extreme threat for the community and the individual. In addition, changes in social behavior, as well as in working conditions, daily habits and routine, are expected to impose further stress, especially with the expectation of an upcoming economic crisis and possible unemployment. In Greece, where the lockdown was extremely successful in terms of containing the outbreak, worries concerning the possible adverse effects on mental health were also predominant. A collaboration concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was established, between the Aristotle University School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association. Two large multinational studies were launched, one concerning the general population and one university students. Students' mental health is an area of special interest, both because of the vulnerability of this age group as well as because any disruption during the time of the studies has profound long-term consequences in the lives of the individuals, and this might trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress. According the results from the Greek arm of the students' study, during the lockdown, two-thirds of university students reported at least 'much' increase in anxiety, one third in depressive feelings and in 2.59% concerning suicidal thoughts. There was also a worsening of quality of life and deterioration of lifestyle issues. Major depression was present in 12.43% with an additional 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Beliefs in conspiracy theories enjoyed wide acceptance ranging from 20-68%, with students of law, literature, pedagogics, political sciences and related studies manifesting higher acceptance rates. Female sex and depression/dysphoria both independently but also in interaction were related to higher rates of such beliefs. The results of the Greek arm of the general population study suggested that during the lockdown, clinical depression was present in 9.31%, with an additional 8.5% experiencing severe distress. Increased anxious and depressive emotions (including subclinical cases) were present in more than 40% of the population. In persons with a previous history of depression, 23.31% experienced depression vs. 8.96% of cases without previous history, who were experiencing their first depressive episode. Family dynamics suggested that fewer conflicts and better quality of relationships were surprisingly related to higher anxiety and depressive emotions, higher rates of depression and distress, and greater rates of suicidal thoughts. Eventually, spiritual and religious affiliation could protect the individual from the emerging suicidal thoughts. As correlation does not imply causation, the results suggest that conspiracy theories could be either the cause of depression or on the contrary a coping mechanism against depression. After taking into consideration that also in the family environment the expression of anger seemed to be a protective factor, the most likely explanation could be that the beliefs in conspiracy theories are a coping and 'protective' mechanism against the emergence of depression. These studies were among the first published, they went deeper in the data collection and even led to the creation of a model with distinct stages for the development of mental disorders during the lockdown. The analysis of the international data will probably provide further insight into the prevalence of mental disorders and the universal but also culturally specific models and factors pertaining to their development. At the time this editorial was in press, more than 40 countries representing more than two thirds of earth's population were participating with more than 45,000 responses already gathered.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic., Results: Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included three randomized trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large increase in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence)., Conclusions: The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is impossible to balance potential benefits, if there are any, with the adverse effects and costs., PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020183384.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The disease caused by the new coronavi-rus (sars-CoV-2) has affected virtually everyone since its first report in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In most cases, the disease will have a mild to moderate symptomatology; in cases of severe symptomatology, hospital care and monitoring with supportive treatment is necessary. Due to the absence of specific directed treatment or vaccines with proven effectiveness, a tool of great impact to reduce the transmission of sars-CoV-2 is a timely identification and isolation of the infected people, as well as of the asymp-tomatic people with antecedent of close contact with a confirmed case. The tests currently available consist of nucleic acid sequence detection using the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reac-tion (rt-pcr) test, serology and viral antigen detection. The standard test for the covid-19 diagnosis is the rt-pcr. The sensitivity and specificity of the test varies according to the time the sample is taken with respect to the beginning of symptoms. The nasopharyngeal sample has a higher sensitivity.

{"text": "Evaluation of Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2: Diagnostic Value of a New Multiplex Addressable Laser Bead Immunoassay. Despite efforts to develop anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody (Ab) immunoassays, reliable serological methods are still needed. We developed a multiplex addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) to detect and quantify anti-Spike S1 and nucleocapsid N Abs. Recombinant S1 and N proteins were bound to fluorescent beads (ALBIA-IgG-S1/N). Abs were revealed using class-specific anti-human Ig Abs. The performances of the test were analyzed on 575 serum samples including 192 from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed patients, 13 from seasonal coronaviruses, 70 from different inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, and 300 from healthy donors. Anti-S1 IgM were detected by monoplex ALBIA-IgM-S1. Comparison with chemiluminescent assays or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was performed using commercial tests. Multiplex ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was effective in detecting and quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Abs. Two weeks after first symptoms, sensitivity and specificity were 97.7 and 98.0% (anti-S1), and 100 and 98.7% (anti-N), respectively. Agreement with commercial tests was good to excellent, with a higher sensitivity of ALBIA. ALBIA-IgG-S1/N was positive in 53% of patients up to day 7, and in 75% between days 7 and 13. For ALBIA-IgM-S1, sensitivity and specificity were 74.4 and 98.7%, respectively. Patients in intensive care units had higher IgG Ab levels (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05).

Rationale: Uncontrolled inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive immune response are associated with clinical severity in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective(s): To compare the immunopathology of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with that of non-COVID-19 ARDS, and to identify biomarkers associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Method(s): Prospective observational monocenter study. Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020, were included and compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS.

After adjusting on age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, serum CXCL10/IP-10 (P = 0.047) and GM-CSF (P = 0.050) were higher and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR cycle threshold values lower (P = 0.010) in patients with COVID-19 who were dead at Day 28. Conclusion(s): Profound global lymphopenia and a \"chemokine signature\" were observed in COVID-19 ARDS. Increased serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 and GM-CSF, together with higher nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, were associated with Day-28 mortality.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the American Thoracic Society", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Predicting Disease Severity and Outcome in COVID-19 Patients. Context.-An abundance of clinical reports focused on specific laboratory parameters have been reported on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), but a systematic analysis synthesizing these findings has not been performed. Objective.-To review and summarize the current available literature on the predictive role of various biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources.-A literature search was performed using databases including PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. A total of 72 papers were reviewed, including 54 peer-reviewed papers and 18 non-peer-reviewed preprints. Conclusions.-Although the markers are considered nonspecific, acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, serum amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin, were reported as sensitive markers of acute COVID-19 disease. Significantly elevated white blood cell count; marked lymphopenia; decreased CD3, CD4, or CD8 T-lymphocyte counts; high neutrophil count; thrombocytopenia; and markedly elevated inflammatory biomarkers were associated with severe disease and the risk of developing sepsis with rapid progression. Trends observed by serial laboratory measurements during hospitalization, including progressive decrease of lymphocyte count, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP, procalcitonin, increased liver enzymes, decreased renal function, and coagulation derangements, were more common in critically ill patient groups and associated with a high incidence of clinical complications. Elevated interleukin 6 level and markedly increased SAA were most often reported in severely and critically ill patients. Indicators of systemic inflammation, such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, or COVID-19 Severity Score, may be used to predict disease severity, outcome, and mortality. Interpretation of the data reported in the studies reviewed here is limited because of the study design (mostly retrospective), limited sample size, and a lack of defined clinical criteria.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-from-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use during the COVID-19 Stay-at-home Period: A Prospective Study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive Internet use amidst this unusual health crisis., OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period, and to test three hypothesized risk-reduction or risk-elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects., METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 U.K. and 474 U.S. adult residents at two assessment points two months apart., RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 36% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 33%-39%) at Time 1 and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 25%-30%) at Time 2. The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support., CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the two-month study period was high among the U.K. and U.S. residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression., CLINICALTRIAL:", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) at acute hospital settings in the South-East of Ireland, as a crucial step in guiding policies and interventions to maintain their psychological well-being., DESIGN: Observational cohort study., PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 472 HCWs participated from two distinct acute hospital settings, A and B, in the South-East of Ireland., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-as dictated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). An independent sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance of difference in continuous variables between groups. Categorical variables were assessed for significance with a chi2 test for independence., RESULTS: The DASS-21 provided independent measures of depression (mean 4.57, IQR 2-7), anxiety (mean 3.87, IQR 1-6) and stress (mean 7.41, IQR 4-10). Positive scores were reflected in 201 workers (42.6%) for depression and 213 (45.1%) for both anxiety and stress. The IES-R measured subjective distress on three subscales: intrusion (mean 1.085, IQR 0.375-1.72), avoidance (mean 1.008, IQR 0.375-1.5) and hyperarousal (mean 1.084, IQR 0.5-1.667). Overall, 195 cases (41.3%) were concerning for PTSD. Site B scored significantly higher across all parameters of depression (5.24 vs 4.08, p<0.01), anxiety (4.66 vs 3.3, p<0.01), stress (8.91 vs 6.33, p<0.01) and PTSD (0.058 vs 0.043, p<0.01). Worse outcomes were also noted in HCWs with underlying medical ailments., CONCLUSION: Psychological distress is prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic; screening for adverse mental and emotional outcomes and developing timely tailored preventative measures with effective feedback are vital to protect their psychological well-being, both in the immediate and long-term.

Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has brought serious psychological pressure to people, especially medical health staff. At present, there are few studies on insomnia and related factors of medical health staff in the middle and late stage of the epidemic of COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and its related risk factors among medical workers in China in the middle and later stage of COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the relationship between insomnia and psychological resilience. Methods: From February 14 to March 29, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 606 medical staff in China through Ranxing Technology's \"SurveyStar\" network platform. All subjects were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and simplified Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC-10). Results: In the middle and later stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of insomnia among medical staff was 32.0%. Compared with non-insomnia group, the insomnia group had younger age, lower education level, longer daily working hours and less psychological resilience. In addition, the prevalence of insomnia was higher in medical staff with a history of somatic diseases. The severity of insomnia of Chinese medical staff was associated with age, education level, daily working hours, psychological resilience and somatic diseases. Conclusions: Our study shows that nearly 1/3 of Chinese medical workers suffer from insomnia nearly a month after the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared with the general population, medical staff who are working with COVID are more prone to insomnia. Risk factors for insomnia include younger age, lower education level, longer working hours per day, and physical illness. The tenacious dimension of psychological resilience is a protective factor for insomnia.

{"text": "Early High-Titer Plasma Therapy to Prevent Severe Covid-19 in Older Adults. BACKGROUND: Therapies to interrupt the progression of early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remain elusive. Among them, convalescent plasma administered to hospitalized patients has been unsuccessful, perhaps because antibodies should be administered earlier in the course of illness., METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG titers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in older adult patients within 72 hours after the onset of mild Covid-19 symptoms. The primary end point was severe respiratory disease, defined as a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or more, an oxygen saturation of less than 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air, or both. The trial was stopped early at 76% of its projected sample size because cases of Covid-19 in the trial region decreased considerably and steady enrollment of trial patients became virtually impossible., RESULTS: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization. In the intention-to-treat population, severe respiratory disease developed in 13 of 80 patients (16%) who received convalescent plasma and 25 of 80 patients (31%) who received placebo (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.94; P = 0.03), with a relative risk reduction of 48%. A modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded 6 patients who had a primary end-point event before infusion of convalescent plasma or placebo showed a larger effect size (relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.81). No solicited adverse events were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of high-titer convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2 to mildly ill infected older adults reduced the progression of Covid-19.

{"text": "Burnout Syndrome Among Hospital Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Civil War: A Cross-Sectional Study. Objective: We aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among hospital healthcare workers in Libya during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and civil war. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 18 to May 2, 2020 among Libyan healthcare workers. Data on participant characteristics were collected with a specifically designed questionnaire. Burnout was assessed with the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) comprising three subscales: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA), with each sub-scale score range from 0 to 18. For EE and DP, scores of 10 to 18 were regarded as \"moderate to severe burnout.\" PA was scored inversely, where a score <= 10 indicated severe burnout. Results: The study yielded a sample size of 532 participants. Of these, 357 (67.1%) reported emotional exhaustion (EE Score >= 10), 252 (47.4%) reported depersonalization (DP score >= 10), and 121 (22.7%) reported a lower sense of personal accomplishment (PA score <= 10). Verbal abuse was experienced by 304 participants (57.1%) and physical abuse in 93 (17.5). Gender was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. Being 35 years or older was associated with high depersonalization. Professional specialty was significantly associated with high emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Fear of COVID-19 infection was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. Conclusion:  The rising prevalence of mental disorders and inadequate availability of health services facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war demonstrated the need for healthcare policies to address the well-being of healthcare workers to decrease the risk of loss, suicide, and medical negligence.

{"text": "Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) and Viral Detection in Polluted Surface Water: A Valuable Tool for COVID-19 Surveillance-A Brief Review. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 Infections and COVID-19 Fatality: Estimation of Infection Fatality Ratio and Current Prevalence. COVID-19 is one of the most important problems for public health, according to the number of deaths associated to this pathology reported so far. However, from the epidemiological point of view, the dimension of the problem is still unknown, since the number of actual cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected people is underestimated, due to limited testing. This paper aims at estimating the actual Infection Fatality Ratio (number of deaths with respect to the number of infected people) and the actual current prevalence (number of infected people with respect to the entire population), both in a specific population and all over the world. With this aim, this paper proposes a method to estimate Infection Fatality Ratio of a still ongoing infection, based on a daily estimation, and on the relationship between this estimation and the number of tests performed per death. The method has been applied using data about COVID-19 from Italy. Results show a fatality ratio of about 0.9%, which is lower than previous findings. The number of actual infected people in Italy is also estimated, and results show that (i) infection started at the end of January 2020; (ii) a maximum number of about 100,000 new cases in one day was reached at the beginning of March 2020; (iii) the estimated cumulative number of infections at the beginning of October 2020 is about 4.2 million cases in Italy (more than 120 million worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured as reasonable). Therefore, the prevalence at the beginning of October 2020 is estimated at about 6.9% in Italy (1.6% worldwide, if a generalization is conjectured).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Of 127 COVID-19 patients tested for lipase, 20 (15.7%) had serum lipase levels above the upper laboratory limit. The patient group with the \"high lipase level\" was created from these subjects, and the rest constituted the \"control\" group., Results: While body mass index (BMI) levels were higher in the high lipase group, (p=0.014), the number of those with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) was also found higher in the high lipase group than the controls (p=0.002). The history of DM was detected to increase the risk of developing high lipase level 4.63 times higher. Only two patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP).

Background The use of computed tomography (CT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in an area of northern Italy with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have identified more patients with this disease than RT-PCR in the very early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9%, the mortality rate was 18.8%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression.

{"text": "Modelling interventions to control COVID-19 outbreaks in a refugee camp. BACKGROUND: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the mainstay of control in the COVID-19 pandemic. Refugee populations in displacement camps live under adverse conditions that are likely to favour the spread of disease. To date, only a few cases of COVID-19 have appeared in refugee camps, and whether feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions can prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in such settings remains untested., METHODS: We constructed the first spatially explicit agent-based model of a COVID-19 outbreak in a refugee camp, and applied it to evaluate feasible non-pharmaceutical interventions. We parameterised the model using published data on the transmission rates and progression dynamics of COVID-19, and demographic and spatial data from Europe's largest refugee camp, the Moria displacement camp on Lesbos, Greece. We simulated COVID-19 epidemics with and without four feasible interventions., RESULTS: Spatial subdivision of the camp ('sectoring') was able to 'flatten the curve', reducing peak infection by up to 70% and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with the efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection, and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly in order to be maximally effective. Lockdowns had only small effects on COVID-19 dynamics., CONCLUSIONS: Agent-based models are powerful tools for forecasting the spread of disease in spatially structured and heterogeneous populations. Our findings suggest that feasible interventions can slow the spread of COVID-19 in a refugee camp setting, and provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies. Our model can be modified to study other closed populations at risk from COVID-19 or future epidemics. Copyright \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is the worst worldwide pandemic with more than 12,000,000 cases and 560,000 deaths until 14th July 2020. Men were more infected by COVID-19 than women, and male subjects with underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases developed a severe form of the affection, with increased mortality rate. Many factors can contribute to the disparity in disease outcomes, such as hormone-specific reaction and activity of X-linked genes, which modulate the innate and adaptive immune response to virus infection.

{"text": "Factors That Might Affect SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Foreign-Born and U.S.-Born Poultry Facility Workers - Maryland, May 2020. Numerous recent assessments indicate that meat and poultry processing facility workers are at increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-4). Physical proximity to other workers and shared equipment can facilitate disease transmission in these settings (2-4). The disproportionate number of foreign-born workers employed in meat and poultry processing reflects structural, social, and economic inequities that likely contribute to an increased COVID-19 incidence in this population* (5). In May 2020, the Maryland Department of Health and CDC investigated factors that might affect person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons who worked at two poultry processing facilities.  A survey administered to 359 workers identified differences in risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between workers born outside the United States and U.S.-born workers. Compared with U.S.-born workers, foreign-born workers had higher odds of working in fixed locations on the production floor (odds ratio [OR] for cutup and packaging jobs = 4.8), of having shared commutes (OR = 1.9), and of living with other poultry workers (OR = 6.0). They had lower odds of participating in social gatherings (OR for visits to family = 0.2; OR for visits to friends = 0.4), and they visited fewer businesses in the week before the survey than did their U.S.-born coworkers. Some workplace risk factors can be mitigated through engineering and administrative controls focused on the production floor, and this will be of particular benefit to the foreign-born workers concentrated in these areas. Employers and health departments can also partner with local organizations to disseminate culturally and linguistically tailored messages about risk reduction behaviors in community settings, including shared transportation and household members dwelling in close quarters.P.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is a global pandemic that carries significant morbidity and mortality. However, the effect of COVID-19 on liver disease, and vice versa, is not well-characterized in the United States. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity. We examined the association between NAFLD and COVID19 disease severity in a large cohort of patients. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 396 consecutive adult patients with RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020 at Michigan Medicine. NAFLD was defined as either prior imaging evidence of steatosis or hepatic steatosis index >36 for Asians or >39 for non-Asians, with no history of alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was disease severity based on admission to intensive care, intubation, death, or the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the predictors of intensive care, intubation, or death and linear regression for disease severity on WHO ordinal scale. NAFLD was the primary predictor and models were adjusted for age, sex, race, recent healthcare exposure, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. RESULT(S): The median age was 60.5 years, 52% were male, 46% were Black, 41% were White and 54% had NAFLD. Of 396 patients, 86% were hospitalized, 45% required intensive care, 30% required intubation, and 14% died. 213 (54%) patients had NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD were older (65 vs. 57 years; P < 0.001), had higher body mass index (34.5 vs. 26.4; P < 0.001), and higher prevalence of diabetes (45% vs. 34%; P = 0.039) than those without NAFLD (Table 1). NAFLD was independently associated with increased odds of requiring admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [1.06-2.62], P = 0.027) and intubation (OR 2.46 [1.50-4.04], P < 0.001), as well as higher WHO ordinal scale (beta 0.43 [0.03-0.84], P = 0.036). There was no significant association between NAFLD and death (OR 0.84 [0.46-1.67], P = 0.62) (Table 2.) CONCLUSION(S): Our study shows that patients with NAFLD were more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19. (Table Presented).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of chronic liver disease on outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A multicenter United States experience. INTRODUCTION: Liver injury has been described with COVID-19, and early reports suggested 2-11% of patients had chronic liver disease (CLD). However, there are limited reports on the nature of liver disease among COVID-19 patients and how underlying CLD influences clinical outcomes. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the US, as well as metabolic syndrome and obesity being potential poor prognostic factors for COVID-19, we hypothesized that CLD, particularly NAFLD, may be associated with more severe clinical course and worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We aimed to study the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on the manifestations and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. METHOD(S): This was a multicenter retrospective study of hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the impact of CLD on disease severity, including hospital length of stay, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. Secondary outcomes included the comparisons of patient characteristics, other clinical manifestations of disease, and laboratory results on admission between patients with and without CLD. Further analyses were performed by stratifying patients with CLD into those with and without cirrhosis, and into NAFLD and non-NAFLD. Student's t-test/Fisher Exact test were performed for univariate analyses; logistic regression were performed for multivariable analyses. RESULT(S): Of 363 patients included, 69 (19%) had CLD, including 55 (15.2%) with NAFLD. Patients with CLD had longer length of stay (Table 1). After controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiac diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and pulmonary disorders, CLD and NAFLD were independently associated with ICU admission [(aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03-3.04) and (aOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.27-4.17)] and mechanical ventilation [(aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.20-3.60) and (aOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.18-3.91)] (Table 2). Presence of cirrhosis was an independent predictor of mortality (aOR 12.5, 95% CI 2.16-72.5). CONCLUSION(S): Overall, nearly one-fifth of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had CLD, which was associated with more critical illness. This association was observed in patients with NAFLD but not in those with non-NAFLD CLD. This difference might, in part, be secondary to the association between NAFLD and obesity, inflammation and oxidative stress. While patients with NAFLD were more likely to be admitted to the ICU and require mechanical ventilation, only those with cirrhosis had an increased risk of mortality.

{"text": "Amyloidosis involving the gastrointestinal tract. INTRODUCTION: Amyloidosis is a generic term that refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of normal serum proteins. There are many different types of amyloid proteins that can be associated with various disease processes including Alzheimer's dementia, nephrotic syndrome, restrictive cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, bleeding diathesis, and macroglossia among others. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 79-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and congenital singular kidney presented to the emergency department with complaints of skin bruising and leg swelling for several months. The patient also reported fatigue, alternating diarrhea and constipation, along with more than a twenty-pound weight loss 6 months. Examination revealed a cachectic man with ecchymoses in different stages disseminated throughout his body and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Labs were significant for serum creatinine of 2.10 mg/dL5, urine microalbumin of 973 ng/dL, urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio of 1624 ng/dL. His urine kappa and lambda light chains were elevated as well. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a large amount of retained fluid in the stomach, which was suctioned and nodular mucosa in the duodenal bulb Duodenal biopsy Congo red stain showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light compatible with amyloidosis. Abdominal fat pad biopsy was also consistent with amyloidosis. He later developed abdominal distension and ileus, which was treated with NG tube decompression. He was planned for empiric treatment for Multiple Myeloma but was lost to follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: There are two common types of amyloid protein: primary amyloid (AL) and inflammtory type (AA). AL is associated with plasma cell disorders like Multiple Myeloma. AA is associated with chronic inflammation like in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Amyloidosis most commonly involves the heart and kidney, while biopsy proven GI involvement is relatively rare. GI biopsy is frequently positive in the duodenum, colorectum, and esophagus. Treatment usually involves treating the underlying condition. Our patient's manifestations of amyloidosis included skin lesions, ileus (global bowel dysfunction), nephropathy, and weight loss. He was presumed to have AL type amyloidosis based on positive urine protein electrophoresis.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The impact of COVID-19 on routine patient care from a laboratory perspective. Background. Globally, few studies have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine patient care and follow-up. Objectives. To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 response on biochemical test requests received from outpatient departments (OPDs) and peripheral clinics serviced by the National Health Laboratory Service Chemical Pathology Laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa (SA). Request volumes were used as a measure of the routine care of patients, as clinical information was not readily available. Methods. A retrospective audit was conducted. The numbers of requests received from OPDs and peripheral clinics for creatinine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine (fT3), serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains and neonatal total serum bilirubin were obtained from 1 March to 30 June for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results. The biggest impact was seen on lipids, creatinine, HbA1c, TSH and fT3. The percentage reduction between 1 March and 30 June 2019 and between 1 March and 30 June 2020 was 59% for lipids, 64% for creatinine and HbA1c, 80% for TSH and 81% for fT3. There was a noteworthy decrease in overall analyte testing from March to April 2020, coinciding with initiation of level 5 lockdown. Although an increase in testing was observed during June 2020, the number of requests was still lower than in June 2019. Conclusions. This study, focusing on the short-term consequences of the SA response to the COVID-19 pandemic, found that routine follow-up of patients with communicable and non-communicable diseases was affected. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term consequences of the pandemic for these patient groups.Copyright \u00a9 2020 South African Medical Association.

{"text": "REGN-COV2, a Neutralizing Antibody Cocktail, in Outpatients with Covid-19. BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that complications and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may be related to high viral loads., METHODS: In this ongoing, double-blind, phase 1-3 trial involving nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19, we investigated two fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, used in a combined cocktail (REGN-COV2) to reduce the risk of the emergence of treatment-resistant mutant virus. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGN-COV2, or 8.0 g of REGN-COV2 and were prospectively characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive or serum antibody-negative). Key end points included the time-weighted average change from baseline in viral load from day 1 through day 7 and the percentage of patients with at least one Covid-19-related medically attended visit through day 29. Safety was assessed in all patients., RESULTS: Data from 275 patients are reported. The least-squares mean difference (combined REGN-COV2 dose groups vs. placebo group) in the time-weighted average change in viral load from day 1 through day 7 was -0.56 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.02 to -0.11) among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline and -0.41 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI, -0.71 to -0.10) in the overall trial population. In the overall trial population, 6% of the patients in the placebo group and 3% of the patients in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups reported at least one medically attended visit; among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline, the corresponding percentages were 15% and 6% (difference, -9 percentage points; 95% CI, -29 to 11). The percentages of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and other adverse events were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group., CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis, the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, with a greater effect in patients whose immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load at baseline. Safety outcomes were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group.

{"text": "Thalidomide Combined with Short-term Low-Dose Glucocorticoid Therapy for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19: A Case-Series Study. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, in combination with glucocorticoid for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with life-threatening symptoms., METHODS: A nonrandomized comparative case series study was performed. Six patients received thalidomide 100 mg per day (with therapy lasting for >=7 days) plus low-dose short-term dexamethasone, and 6 control patients matched with patients in the thalidomide group, received low-dose short-term treatment with dexamethasone alone. The main outcomes were: the duration of SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion from admission; length of hospital stay; and changes in inflammatory cytokine concentrations and lymphocyte subsets., RESULTS: The median thalidomide treatment time was 12.0 days. The median durations of SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion from admission (11.0 vs 23.0 days, P = 0.043) and hospital stay lengths were both briefer in the thalidomide group compared to the controls (18.5 vs 30.0 days, P = 0.043). The mean reduction rates at 7-10 days after treatment for serum interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma concentrations were greater in the thalidomide group compared to the controls. Alterations in lymphocyte numbers in the subsets between the 2 groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide plus short-term glucocorticoid therapy is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients. The mechanism of action is most likely inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production. Copyright \u00a9 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 have increased composite morbidity compared with nonpregnant matched controls. Background: In March 2020, as community spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 became increasingly prevalent, pregnant women seemed to be equally susceptible to developing coronavirus disease 2019. Although the disease course usually appears mild, severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 seem to lead to substantial morbidity, including intensive care unit admission with prolonged hospital stay, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and even death. Although there are recent reports regarding the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pregnancy, there is a lack of information regarding the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant vs nonpregnant women. Objective(s): We aimed to describe the outcomes of severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant vs nonpregnant, reproductive-aged women. Study Design: This is a multicenter, retrospective, case-control study of women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection hospitalized with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in 4 academic medical centers in New York City and 1 in Philadelphia between March 12, 2020, and May 5, 2020. The cases consisted of pregnant women admitted specifically for severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 and not for obstetrical indications. The controls consisted of reproductive-aged, nonpregnant women admitted for severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. The primary outcome was a composite morbidity that includes the following: death, a need for intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or a need for high-flow nasal cannula O2 supplementation. The secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admission, length of stay, a need for discharge to long-term acute care facilities, and discharge with a home O2 requirement. Result(s): A total of 38 pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction-confirmed infections were admitted to 5 institutions specifically for coronavirus disease 2019, 29 (76.3%) meeting the criteria for severe disease status and 9 (23.7%) meeting the criteria for critical disease status. The mean age and body mass index were markedly higher in the nonpregnant control group. The nonpregnant cohort also had an increased frequency of preexisting medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The pregnant women were more likely to experience the primary outcome when compared with the nonpregnant control group (34.2% vs 14.9%; P=.03; adjusted odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-18.2). The pregnant patients experienced higher rates of intensive care unit admission (39.5% vs 17.0%; P<.01; adjusted odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-17.5). Among the pregnant women who underwent delivery, 72.7% occurred through cesarean delivery and the mean gestational age at delivery was 33.8+/-5.5 weeks in patients with severe disease status and 35+/-3.5 weeks in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 status. Conclusion(s): Pregnant women with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 are at an increased risk for certain morbidities when compared with nonpregnant controls. Despite the higher comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension in the nonpregnant controls, the pregnant cases were at an increased risk for composite morbidity, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be associated with a worse outcome in women with severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Our study suggests that similar to other viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pregnant women may be at risk for greater morbidity and disease severity.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Budd-chiari syndrome secondary to SARS-COV-2 infection. INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with potentially severe multi-organ complications. Currently, a major discussion revolves around the thrombotic risk of this disease, though little is known about this risk within the gastrointestinal tract and portal system. The below case describes a patient with SARS-CoV-2 subsequently diagnosed with Budd-Chiari syndrome. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol-associated cirrhosis presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. On exam he was somnolent and jaundiced, with ascites but no focal neurologic deficits. Initial blood work revealed a leukocytosis with elevated transaminases, bilirubin and INR (Table 1), resulting in a MELD-Na score of 29 and a discriminant function over 32. Nasal swab detected SARS-CoV-2. His presentation was consistent with decompensated cirrhosis complicated by alcoholic hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. Paracentesis showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He was started on empiric antibiotics, prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis, lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and prednisolone for alcoholic hepatitis. After initial clinical improvement, he developed right upper quadrant abdominal pain and recurrent elevation in his liver enzymes. An abdominal ultrasound was performed showing poor flow through the portal venous system. Subsequently, an abdominal CT demonstrated extensive veno-occlusive disease involving the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome (Figure 1). To minimize bleeding risk, he underwent variceal band ligation prior to initiation of anticoagulation. DISCUSSION: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare, veno-occlusive condition characterized by obstruction of the hepatic veins; treatment often involves anticoagulation. In most cases, there is an underlying disorder generating a hypercoagulable state. Recent studies have raised concerns about the thrombotic nature of SARS-CoV-2, especially due to the high incidence of infarcts, emboli, and strokes seen in this population. In the absence of other known risk factors for thrombotic disease in this patient, it is likely SARS-CoV-2 was the predisposing pro-thrombotic factor. In patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and new or worsening liver findings, early consideration of and testing for hepatic veno-occlusive disease and timely initiation of anticoagulation may help prevent serious complications.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Covid-19-induced acute hepatitis treated successfully with n-acetylcysteine: Case report. INTRODUCTION: Mild liver impairment is widely reported in patients with COVID19. However, Acute hepatitis (AH) was reported in only one case found in a 99-case series published in China.Nacetylcysteine (NAC) is a known medication used in acetaminophen-induced hepatitis, works as a hepatoprotective agent via multiple mechanisms, including restoring hepatic glutathione as well as an antioxidant. It seems that its therapeutic use could be extended to manage cases of AH induced by other medical conditions like COVID 19 as in our case. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: 64 years old male presented with progressive dyspnea, fever, and myalgia. He was diagnosed with COVID19 at a different facility two days prior to the current presentation and was sent home to self-quarantine. On presentation, the patient was mildly hypoxia that responded to nasal oxygen, but never hypotensive. Laboratory results were significant for elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) at 1,264, 767 Units/L respectively. Alkaline phosphates showed a 1.5-fold increase from his baseline. Total bilirubin, Albumin, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio (INR) were all normal throughout hospitalization. Viral hepatitis panel and autoimmune hepatitis panel (including anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and immunoglobulin G level were also negative. Serum salicylate and acetaminophen levels, urine toxicology screening test, and respiratory viral panel (novel Coronavirus not included) were all negative. Serum ferritin was elevated at 20,325 ng/mL, while serum iron was 40 mcg/dL and total iron-binding capacity was 282 mcg/dL. Upon admission, the patient was given a loading dose of NAC followed by maintenance doses. Two days later, AST and ALT started to trend down. Two days later, alkaline phosphatase followed suit. The patient was also placed on the COVID19 treatment regimen used in our facility, including Azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, and Zinc sulfate. Systemic corticosteroids were initiated on day 6 due to worsening hypoxia. Eventually, the patient's inflammatory markers normalized on day 9. Hypoxia improved and he was successfully discharged home. DISCUSSION: We reported a rare case of COVID19 induced AH along with our observation of possible benefit from using NAC in treating this condition. NAC is known for its safety profile. Hence, we believe that more studies need to investigate the role of NAC in treating cases of AH.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 3 January and 1 February 2020 were included. All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infections. Epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics; underlying diseases; laboratory tests; treatments; complications; and outcomes data were collected. Outcomes were followed up at discharge until 15 February 2020. Results. The study cohort included 102 adult patients. The median age was 54 years (interquartile ranger, 37-67 years), and 48.0% were female. A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to a source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health-care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster. There were 18 patients (17.6%) who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval, 9.4-23.9%). Those patients who survived were younger, were more likely to be health-care workers, and were less likely to suffer from comorbidities. They were also less likely to suffer from complications. There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and nonsurvival groups. Those patients who survived were less likely to require admission to the ICU (14.1% vs 35.3% of those admitted). Chest imaging examinations showed that patients who died were more likely to have ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs 12.9% in survivors). Conclusions. The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were the development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and a severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU. Our data support those described by others indicating that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and from nosocomial transmission. There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatments.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps have been released to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. But it remains unclear how their acceptance and uptake can be improved., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate SwissCovid app coverage and reasons for not using the app in Switzerland during a time of increasing SARS-CoV-2 incidence., METHODS: By use of data collected between 28.09.2020 to 08.10.2020 for a nationwide online panel survey (Covid-19 Social Monitor, n=1'511 participants), socio-demographic and behavioral factors associated with app usage were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Reasons for app non-use were analyzed descriptively., RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% of participants reported using the SwissCovid app (up from 43.9% in a study wave conducted in July 2020). A higher monthly household income (e.g., OR 1.92 [1.40-2.64] for an income >CHF 10'000 vs. an income <= CHF 6'000), more frequent internet use (e.g., daily (reference) vs. less than weekly OR 0.37 [0.16-0.85]), better adherence to mask-wearing recommendations (e.g., always or most of the time (reference) vs. rarely or never OR 0.28 [0.15-0.52]), and being a non-smoker (OR 1.32 [1.01-1.71]) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (e.g., non-Swiss citizenship 0.61 [0.43-0.87] vs. Swiss citizenship only), and language region (French 0.61 [0.46-0.80], vs. Swiss German) were associated with a lower app uptake probability. In a randomly selected subsample (n=711) with more detailed information, higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were additionally associated with a higher app uptake probability (e.g., OR 3.13 [1.58-6.22] for high vs. low trust (reference)). The most frequent reasons for app non-use was lack of perceived benefit of the app (36.8%), 22.8% reported having no compatible phone, and 22.4% had privacy concerns., CONCLUSIONS: Removing technical hurdles and communicating the benefits of DPT-apps are crucial to promote further uptake, adherence, and ultimately to enhance effectiveness of DPT-apps for pandemic mitigation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Context: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the United States. Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. Objective(s): We explored the population of myeloma patients who developed COVID-19 to identify risk factors tied to poor outcomes. Design(s): We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Setting(s): A large tertiary care cancer center in New York at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Patient(s): Patient charts were analyzed retrospectively. Patients had MM or SMM and COVID-19. Result(s): Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male, and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex, and cardiovascular risk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusion(s): Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on patient outcome. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes of myeloma patients in future outbreaks of COVID-19. The majority of myeloma patients mounted a specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "An unexpected cause of colitis in a cardiac transplant patient. INTRODUCTION: Mycophenolate induced colitis is an unexpected complication of the immunosuppression medication. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 36 year-old-female with a history of Epstein's anomaly underwent repeat orthotropic heart transplant in 2020 due to primary graft failure of the first transplant in 2019. Mycophenolate had been changed to Myfortic for abdominal complaints prior to retransplant. She had early mild allograft dysfunction despite unremarkable prospective crossmatch and first surveillance right ventricular biopsy (RVB). She was empirically treated with rituximab, high dose intravenous steroids, serial plasmapheresis, and IVIG. Despite improving cardiac function, she developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on subacute renal failure, and worsening anemia. Repeat RVB revealed acute antibody and T-cell mediated rejection; the Myfortic dose was increased. Two weeks later the patient developed abdominal pain and loose maroon-colored bloody stool. Lab data showed a white blood cell count of 3.61k/ul and hemoglobin of 9.1g/dl. Elevated liver tests: Alk Phos 143U/L and ALT 111U/L. The CRP was normal however the fecal calprotectin was greater than 1250 ug/g. The SARS-CoV-2 and stool studies including clostridioides difficile, serum CMV IgG yielded negative results. A CT scan showed distension of the colon with an average amount of retained stool and gas. No bowel inflammation was noted. Colonoscopy showed diffuse edematous folds, loss of vascularity, and friable mucosa with dispersed aphthous ulcers and erosions from cecum to the sigmoid colon (Figure 1a, 1b, and 1c). The mucosa was biopsied with concern for inflammatory bowel disease, viral etiology, or undiagnosed inflammatory bowel disease. On histology, the colon mucosa was noted to have interstitial edema, abortive mitosis, eosinophilia, and scattered dilated irregular shaped crypts, most consistent with Mycophenolate related colitis (Figure 2). There was no evidence of viral inclusion bodies. Myfortic was replaced with renal dosing of Azathioprine. There was a dramatic improvement in appetite, nausea, energy, and renal function with no subsequent bloody stools or abdominal pain. DISCUSSION: There are very few reported cases of Mycophenolate induced colitis. Our patient developed bloody stools, acute kidney injury and abdominal pain as was the case in other reports. An elevated fecal calprotectin and the above biopsy findings helped clinch the diagnosis. New-onset colitis can be noted even if the patient was previously on Mycophenolate.

{"text": "Gastrointestinal manifestation of COVID-19: A case report describing acute pancreatitis in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. INTRODUCTION: Over seven million cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed thus far with over four hundred thousand deaths (1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 with a spectrum of disease severity with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Studies have shown SARS-CoV-2 inducing damage to heart, kidney and pulmonary tissue through possible binding of the ACE2 receptor (10). As the incidence of COVID-19 cases increase, there is increased reporting of gastrointestinal manifestations. In view of this, we report a case of COVID-19 induced pancreatitis. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: 69-year-old lady initially admitted for respiratory failure in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia presents 3 days after discharge with epigastric pain. Her medical history significant for a prior cholecystectomy. Patient never smoked, drank alcohol, or used illicit drugs. Labs and imaging significant for leukocytosis, mildly elevated lipase, and CT abdomen suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Given her findings, she was diagnosed with mild acute pancreatitis. She was volume resuscitated, pain managed with hydromorphone, and started on early parenteral nutrition. She tolerated a diet by hospital day 5 and discharged home. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is met when patients fulfill two of the following criteria: typical symptoms, lipase/amylase three times the upper limit of normal, or imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. In our case presentation, our patient met the criteria confirming the diagnosis. In regards to the etiology, a comprehensive evaluation found no particular etiology for our patient's pancreatitis. However, viruses can be a potential cause of acute pancreatitis. Previous theories suggest direct destruction of pancreatic acinar cells via inflammation and edema particularly in HBV induced pancreatitis. We suggest there may be a similar state of inflammation occurring from coronavirus infection. It is speculated SARS-CoV-2 may use its spike (S) protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane to gain entry into the cell (14). Liu et. al showed expression of ACE2 in both exocrine gland and islets of the pancreas. At this time, pathogenesis remains unclear, but one can extrapolate SARS-CoV-2 may induce pancreatitis due to direct cytopathic effects of viral entry and replication. As COVID-19 pandemic continues, it would be worthwhile to suspect SARS-CoV-2 as an etiology of acute pancreatitis.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Pneumopericardium by esophageal-pericardial fistula of unknown origin. INTRODUCTION: Esophageal-pericardial fistulas are rare complications which can arise from many different pathologies, such as ulcerations, diverticulum, foreign bodies, carcinomas, radiofrequency atrial ablation, or prior surgeries. It may be difficult to recognize due to vague symptoms such as pain, fever, nausea, hematemesis, dysphagia, or odynophagia. Even when promptly recognized, the mortality rate is often around 80%. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 61 year old female with a past medical history significant for RA, hypothyroidism, bariatric surgery, gastrectomy with gastric pouch, gastric and esophageal ulcers presented to the ED for an evaluation of altered mental status. During a long hospital stay, which included intubation and a short ICU stay, she was found to have pneumopericardium on a routine chest X-ray. A CT chest without contrast was done to confirm. The pneumopericardium was not causing any hemodynamic instability and therefore was treated conservatively with IV antibiotics. A repeat CT was performed the following morning which showed resolving pneumopericardium and therefore no surgery was indicated. Initially the pneumopericardium was believed to be from a fistula from the trachea to the pericardium, presumed due to intubation, however, a barium swallow was performed and showed a fistula formation between the esophagus and pericardium. No surgery was indicated and the patient was on appropriate GI prophylaxis. The patient was placed on TPN until a PEG could be initiated. She remained stable and was discharged to a long term care facility with a plan for follow up EGD in 8 weeks. The patient has not yet followed up due to the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Here we presented a case of an esophageal-pericardial fistula with unknown origin. We presume in our patient, the fistula developed over time due to her long standing GERD, prolonged NSAID use, and known esophageal ulcers. Esophageal-pericardial fistulas are associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and making an early diagnosis is crucial. Patients with pericardial fistulas often complain of chest pain or abdominal pain but can have a wide range of more non-specific symptoms including dyspnea, fever, cough, and even sputum production. It is important to have a high index of suspicion and avoid a delay in the diagnosis, especially if there are risk factors present. This case highlights an example of a patient with a highly fatal diagnosis, who remained hemodynamically stable and relatively asymptomatic during her hospital course.

Background: There are limited data on the outcomes of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and atrial fibrillation (AF). The objectives were to (i) examine associations between AF, 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with COVID-19 and (ii) examine associations between COVID-19, 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality in adults with AF. Method(s): A study was conducted using a global federated health research network. Adults aged >=50 years who presented to 41 participating healthcare organizations between 20 January 2020 and 1 September 2020 with COVID-19 were included. Result(s): For the first objective, 6589 adults with COVID-19 and AF were propensity score matched for age, gender, race, and comorbidities to 6589 adults with COVID-19 without AF. The survival probability was significantly lower in adults with COVID-19 and AF compared to matched adults without AF (82.7% compared to 88.3%, Log-Rank test P <.0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.61 (1.46, 1.78)) and risk of thromboembolic events was higher in patients with AF (9.9% vs 7.0%, Log-Rank test P <.0001; Risk Ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.41 (1.26, 1.59)). For the second objective, 2454 adults with AF and COVID-19 were propensity score matched to 2454 adults with AF without COVID-19. The survival probability was significantly lower for adults with AF and COVID-19 compared to adults with AF without COVID-19, but there was no significant difference in risk of thromboembolic events. Conclusion(s): AF could be an important risk factor for short-term mortality with COVID-19, and COVID-19 may increase risk of short-term mortality amongst adults with AF.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Cancer Disparities: Biology, Environment/Lifestyle or All. Cancer disparities are seen with cancers that disproportionately affect underrepresented minorities and the medically underserved. This is very important since by 2043 the so-called \"minority\" populations will become the majority. Among AA we see disparities in women with breast cancer. AA women had a lower incidence until 2015 but continue to have a higher mortality rate. Triple negative BC is particularly common among AA women and is associated with decreased overall survival. Prostate cancer mortality rate in AA men is now 2.4 times greater than WM. Racial disparities in Colorectal cancer death rates are also seen and may be explained by differences in the use, availability and quality of screening and treatment services. What are the root causes of racial inequities in cancer care: - socioeconomics - limitations in access to quality healthcare But all of this is due to systemic racism which created this environment. There is also the financial toxicity of cancer care in the US. Access to the best diagnostics and treatment are dictated by access to: - private or specific types of insurance - access to significant financial resources This is seen with the lack of access of AA to PET/CT scans at diagnosis for lung cancer which is associated with an improved outcome from treatment. Again, all of which is related to systemic racism and social injustices seen in the US. We also see racial inequities in cancer research. There is a lack of diversity in clinical trials due to low participation of minorities (3-5%). As a result, most of our studies are based on tumor tissue that lacks diversity but becomes the basis for definitive treatment of cancer in all patients. The Covid-19 pandemic has truly revealed to the world disparities in our healthcare in the US. A virus that we are all susceptible to disproportionately affects people of color. Findings just released in the Lancet from the Covid-19 & Cancer consortium has revealed that cancer patients with Covid die at 3x the rate of noncancer patients with the disease. Solutions include increasing diversity among health professionals which improves access to health care for everyone.

Background The role of the immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection is not yet well known, in particular about the persistence of circulating antibodies. The aim of the study is to assess the time course of the IgM and IgG response. Methods We conducted a study on 123 specimens of 62 subjects with disease confirmed by laboratory tests (time from the onset of symptoms from 3 to 110 days). Both IgM and IgG were measured with a chemiluminescence immunoassay (MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgM and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG respectively) on the Maglumi 800 Analyzer (Snibe, Shenzen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results The case study was subdivided into 8 groups (<=10 days from the onset of symptoms, 11-13 days, 14-17, 18-21, 22-28, 30-43, 46-71 and 72-110). The clinical sensitivity of IgG rose from 52.9% to 100% after 18 days, and then remained constant. The sensitivity of IgM rose from 35.3% up to about 78.6% at 20 days, then fell to about 27% after 80 days. Considering the concentrations in the samples, after a rapid increase up to about 20 days, we can see a subsequent decrease of the mean concentrations of both IgM and IgG levels. The quantitative comparison of the different classes showed significantly higher IgG concentrations in the days from 14 to 28 compared to both the first two groups and the groups after 46 days (Kruskall-Wallis test p=0.000001). As for the IgM, the trend is similar to that found for IgG, but the differences between groups were lower (Kruskall-Wallis test p=0.0022) and the absolute concentrations were about one order of magnitude smaller. Discussion The persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Studies on the immune response to other coronaviruses showed that the concentrations of IgG decline after few months from the onset of symptoms, although the positivity rate remained relatively stable over a longer period. In the present study, the results seems to confirm this trend. In fact, although the positivity rates did not fall below 100%, in the class with specimens from 72 to 110 days after the onset of symptoms the median IgG concentrations were less than 10% compared to the levels found after 15-20 days.

OBJECTIVE: In recent studies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased risk of mental health problems across many subpopulations including pregnant and postnatal women. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: This is a multicentre, cross-sectional study comprising 1,309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted., RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% CI=25.01%-29.85%).

{"text": "Management of an acquired hemophilia a case with covid19. Background. Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by auto-antibodies directed against clotting factor VIII (FVIII), often resulting in severe bleeding manifestations. Its treatment is based on haemostatic control and immunosuppressive treatment (IST) to eradicate circulating inhibitors. Since COVID19 pandemic breakout, the management of autoimmune disorders represented a challenge for clinician. Case Report. A 63-years old woman was admitted at the emergency department (ED) at the end of May 2020 for development of hematomas at the upper right arm and left leg. The same patient accessed to ED 3 months before for severe anemia (Hemoglobin, Hb, 4.3 g/dl) and renal failure (Creatinine, Crs, 3.45 mg/dl). A nephrologic consultancy lean for a multifactorial renal failure (acute anemia and anti-inf lammatory drugs abuse). In the recent ED access, anemia and impaired renal function were again detected (Hb 4.9 g/dl, Crs 4,4 mg/dl) with prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time (aPTT ratio, 2.91). An aPTT-mix test was performed and resulted indicative of inhibitor presence. Factor VIII (FVIII) was quantified (FVIII 0.5 UI/dl) and FVII-Inhibitor titred (29 UB). A diagnosis of AHA was made. As indicated by Hospital guidelines, a RT-PCR nasal swab (NS) for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was performed and resulted positive. Thus, the patient was admitted in a dedicated Unit. Here, a screening for other infections, autoimmune disorders and occult neoplasms was carried out, resulting negative. From the immunosuppressive point of view, the case was discussed with an infective disease consultant and pneumologists. Given the absence of any symptoms or sign related to the viral infection and the necessity to initiate a specific IST, an initial management with prednisolone (1 mg/Kg) was started. Given the lack of appreciable response, a second line IST was needed. In order to avoid a viral infection awakening, silent so far, it was waited until two consecutive negative RT-PCR NS for COVID19 were obtained. After that, as a precautionary measure we waited for other two weeks and finally performed a third RT-PCR NS. As it resulted negative, a second line IST with Rituximab (RTX) 375 mg/m2 weekly was started. In the meanwhile, an optimized hemostatic control was assured, first with recombinant activated FVII and then with recombinant porcine FVIII. The patient remains asymptomatic from the infective point of view. A hematologic response started to emerge after the third RTX infusion. Conclusions. This AHA case management resulted challenging since its association with silent COVID19 infection. It was probably not associated from an etiological point of view with COVID19 infection as it did not resolve with the negativization of the COVID19 NS. Our strategy, consisting in a gradual implementation of the IST while moving forward from the NS negativization, together with the optimization of the hemostatic control, resulted safe, as the patient did not experienced an awakening of the silent COVID-19 infection, and efficacy at the same time.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "COVID-19 Vaccines May Not Prevent Nasal SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Asymptomatic Transmission. Current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are administered by injection and designed to produce an IgG response, preventing viremia and the COVID-19 syndrome. However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating. Until further knowledge is acquired regarding mucosal immunity following systemic vaccination, otolaryngology providers should maintain precautions against viral transmission to protect the proportion of persistently vulnerable patients who exhibit subtotal vaccine efficacy or waning immunity or who defer vaccination.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

For both cases, a correct estimate of the composition of the protein corona is the key for an improved understanding. The protein corona composition is typically analyzed indirectly through analysis of the supernatant after protein desorption. However, in most cases the particles are not analyzed afterward in order to ensure that all proteins indeed have desorbed. Here, the results related to the analysis of the amounts of proteins in the corona are reported, focusing on the desorbed as well as the fraction of proteins that do not desorb.

Wilcoxon rank sum, Chi squared, or Fisher's exact test was performed as indicated to ascertain differences between cohorts A p-value of <0.05 was chosen as the cutoff for significance Results: Of the 285 total patients, 225 patients were treated for COVID-19 and 60 patients were diagnosed with MIS-C Patients who presented with MIS-C were significantly younger than those with COVID-19 (mean age of 8 3 vs 10 9 years; p=0 001) The MIS-C cohort had significantly higher mean values of ferritin (2350 5 vs 1249 9 mg/mL; p<0 0001), D-dimer (6 7 vs 4 7ug/mL; p=0 001), CRP (71 4 vs 11 2mg/L; p<0 0001) and troponin (0 15 vs 0 08ng/L; p<0 01) MIS-C patients also had significantly higher rates of intensive care requirements (53.3 % vs 23 8%; p<0 0001) and developed multiorgan failure more frequently (21 7% vs 7 9%; p=0 002) No statistically significant differences were found between the MIS-C and COVID-19 cohorts in the presence of ALI (60% vs 45 5 %): mild ALI was more frequently seen on both (51% vs 33%), and a few had severe ALI (8 3% vs 12 2%), respectively Clinical and laboratory data stratifying the degree of ALI in both cohorts are shown in table 1 Five patients died, all of whom were being treated for an COVID-19 Conclusion(s): These data show that the frequency and severity of ALI in patients with MIS-C or COVID-19 do not significantly differ, despite a seemingly more severe presentation with MIS-C Despite the severity of their presentations, however, children with MIS-C suffered a far lower mortality rate as compared with adults with COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Dengue lurks during coronavirus disease-19 pandemic in indonesia: A narrative review. BACKGROUND: Most attention and healthcare resources in Indonesia have been geared toward battling the coronavirus (CoV) disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, and less overture has been given to the looming risks of dengue that has been endemic in many areas of Indonesia. Despite related constraints, the Primary Health Cares (PHC) in Indonesia plays an important role in the face of emergency situations. AIM: This study aimed to review the dengue and COVID-19 infection, clinical manifestations in children and adults, clinical pathology findings, as well as the prevention strategies that could be applied in PHC. METHOD(S): This study is a narrative review based on the research articles and reports that were published between 2010 and 2020. A total of 70 articles and reports were obtained and after careful consideration, 58 articles and reports were used as references of this study. RESULT(S): Both dengue virus (DENV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV-2) share the similarity of antigenic structure, common symptoms, and laboratory findings. The immune response in SARS-CoV-2 may cause a cytokine storm, which can increase vascular permeability and organ damage. Secondary infection of DENV with different strains may allow the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement. The cross-reactions between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and DENV antigens may cause false positive on rapid dengue infection serological tests. CONCLUSION(S): PHC as the front line of health services has a fundamental role in the crisis situation. The prevention and control of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are based on the mode of transmission and need compliance to the related health protocols.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wienta Diarsvitri, Retno Budiarti, Pramita Anindya Nugraheni, M.

Objectives: The first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on the 4th of March 2020 in Hungary. The aim of our study is to analyse the regional inequalities in the occurrence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in Hungary. Method(s): Data derived from the National Surveillance System (OSZIR) of the National Public Health Center (Nemzeti Nepegeszsegugyi Kozpont) of Hungary. Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in highly specialised laboratories designated for SARS-CoV-2 virus diagnostic. Data of laboratory confirmed cases were reported to the National Surveillance System. The period from the onset of first COVID-19 case up to 7th July 2020 was covered. Data were analysed according to 20 counties of Hungary. Result(s): Altogether 4,205 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified in Hungary resulting in an incidence of 4.35 cases per 10,000 population. The number of novel coronavirus daily cases reached its peak in Hungary between 10-23 April with higher than 100 novel cases per day (0.102 new cases per 10,000 population). There was a 28.88 times higher incidence of COVID-19 in the county with the lowest (Bekes 0.39) and with the highest (Budapest 11.36) occurrence. We found 4 counties with very high COVID-19 incidence (cases per 10,000 population): Budapest (11.36), Komarom-Esztergom county (10.20), Zala county (9.8) and Fejer county (9.05). The lowest frequency of COVID-19 was observed in the following counties (cases per 10,000 population): Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok (0.46), Hajdu-Bihar (0.44), Bacs-Kiskun (0.42) and Bekes (0.39). Conclusion(s): We found 28.88-fold differences in the incidence of COVID-19 cases among Hungarian counties with the lowest and highest occurrence.

{"text": "PIN34 COVID 19 - What Is the Health-Economic Economically Justifiable Price of Lockdown?. Objectives: Many European governments have imposed emergency lockdown measures to reduce interpersonal contact and slow the spread of COVID 19. This has led to substantial reductions in transmission rates and burden of disease but at a very high economic cost. Using health-economic principles, we assess whether lockdown is a cost-effective intervention in five European countries. Method(s): An SIR dynamic transmission model was fitted to COVID 19 incidence data from the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy to estimate total case numbers with and without a government-imposed lockdown. Hospitalisation cost and lockdown costs (based on estimated reductions in GDP) were used to estimate total cost, with QALYs and life-years estimated from observed mortality rates. In the scenario without lockdown, hospitalisations were capped based on health-care capacity, transmission adjusted for 'natural' social distancing, and GDP reduced to account for the impact of disease. Result(s): R0 before lockdown varied from 2.20 to 2.85 and after from 0.40 to 0.75. After the initial upswing, R0 varied between 1.36 and 1.77 in the no-lockdown scenario. Infection rates without lockdown were between 100 and 260 times higher than with lockdown. Incremental costs ranged from $3bn in France to $116bm in Germany, driven by the size of the economy in Germany and high hospitalisation rates observed in France. Per capita costs were highest in Italy at $1,648 per person and lowest in France at $52 per person. Incremental QALYs ranged from 12m in Italy to 30m in France, driven by differences in mortality rates. ICERs varied from $115 per QALY in France to $8,300 per QALY in Italy. Incremental costs per life-year followed similar patterns. Conclusion(s): Lockdown is an expensive but cost-effective intervention. Whilst the average cost across all five countries is over $1,000 per person, cost-effectiveness is driven by huge reductions in hospitalisation and deaths.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Acute encephalitis can occur in different viral diseases due to infection of the brain or by an immune mechanism. Severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a major immune inflammatory response with cytokine upregulation including interleukin 6 (IL-6). We report a case presenting with acute encephalitis that was diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with hyperinflammatory systemic response and recovered after therapy with immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade. Case report: A 39-year-old-man was brought to the Emergency Department with drowsiness, mental disorientation, intermittent fever and headache. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive involvement of the brain including cortical and subcortical right frontal regions, right thalamus, bilateral temporal lobes and cerebral peduncles, with no leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 20/microL (90% lymphocytes), protein level of 198 mg/dL, and glucose of 48 mg/dL. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) but it was negative in the CSF. Remarkable laboratory findings in blood tests included low lymphocyte count and elevated ferritin, IL-6 and D-dimer. He had a complicated clinical course requiring mechanical ventilation. Intravenous immunoglobulins and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, were added considering acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The patient made a full recovery, suggesting that it could have been related to host inflammatory response.

Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19., DESIGN: Case-control Study., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April, 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilization group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalization. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement., RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnea between the two groups. The variables with P < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation., CONCLUSION: Clinicians may warn the exacerbation of COVID-19 facing above risk factors and associated characteristics, and adjust the diagnosis and treatment plan to delay the disease progression, reduce complications and mortality and improve the prognosis of patients., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patients with certain risk factors associated with COVID-19 diseases exacerbation should be observed and targeted by using effective early interventions.

{"text": "Comparative molecular dynamics study of the receptor-binding domains in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and the effects of mutations on the binding affinity. Here, we report on a computational comparison of the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) on the spike proteins of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV in free forms and as complexes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor in humans. The impact of 42 mutations discovered so far on the structure and thermodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was also assessed. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for ACE2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV RBD. The binding of COVA2-04 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more energetically favorable than the binding of COVA2-39, but also less favorable than the formation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex. The net charge, the dipole moment and hydrophilicity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are higher than those of SARS-CoV RBD, producing lower solvation and surface free energies and thus lower stability. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD is also more flexible and more open, with a larger solvent-accessible surface area than that of SARS-CoV RBD. Single-point mutations have a dramatic effect on distribution of charges, most prominently at the site of substitution and its immediate vicinity. These charge alterations alter the free energy landscape, while X->F mutations exhibit a stabilizing effect on the RBD structure through pi stacking. F456 and W436 emerge as two key residues governing the stability and affinity of the spike protein for its ACE2 receptor. These analyses of the structural differences and the impact of mutations on different viral strains and members of the coronavirus genera are an essential aid in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

In some patients, however, the onset of the immune response results in acute lung damage with organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Moderate-severe disease is associated with a high incidence of pulmonary embolisms, generally peripherally distributed and associated with endothelial damage, prolonged stays in bed, and coagulopathy.

Apos a leitura dos resumos, foram selecionados 16 artigos para leitura na integra. De acordo com a pesquisa, verificamos que grande parte dos pacientes portadores de doenca falciforme e com resultado positivo para COVID-19, pode desencadear graves complicacoes pulmonares, crise vaso-oclusiva (CVO) e Sindrome Toracica Aguda (STA), mesmo na ausencia de sintomas gripais. Em relacao ao indice de mortalidade, percebeu-se que as pessoas que tiveram genotipos geralmente associados a DF mais leves (tipos HbSC ou HbSbeta +-talassemia), sao mais propensas a desenvolver um quadro mais grave, necessitar de Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI) e ate mesmo evoluir para obito. No que se refere ao genero e a idade, verificou-se que o sexo feminino predominou com 56,8% dos casos, e a faixa etaria prevalente entre 20-40 anos, no entanto, estes dois fatores nao foram evidenciados como agravantes em pessoas com DF. Em relacao ao tratamento, a maioria dos artigos cita que foi realizado o tratamento de protocolo padrao para as complicacoes pulmonares, CVO, STA e demais a depender dos sintomas que eles apresentavam.

The fine host immune response and its association with the disease course have not yet been fully elucidated. Consequently, we analyze circulating B cell subsets and their possible relationship with COVID-19 features and severity., Methods: Using a multiparametric flow cytometric approach, we determined B cell subsets frequencies from 52 COVID-19 patients, grouped them by hierarchical cluster analysis, and correlated their values with clinical data., Results: The frequency of CD19+ B cells is increased in severe COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Specific subset frequencies such as transitional B cell subsets increase in mild/moderate cases but decrease with the severity of the disease. Memory B compartment decreased in severe and critical cases, and antibody-secreting cells are increased according to the severity of the disease. Other non-typical subsets such as double-negative B cells also showed significant changes according to disease severity. Globally, these differences allow us to identify severity-associated patient clusters with specific altered subsets. Finally, respiratory parameters, biomarkers of inflammation, and clinical scores exhibited correlations with some of these subpopulations., Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 is accompanied by changes in the B cell subpopulations, either immature or terminally differentiated. Furthermore, the existing relationship of B cell subset frequencies with clinical and laboratory parameters suggest that these lymphocytes could serve as potential biomarkers and even active participants in the adaptive antiviral response mounted against SARS-CoV-2.

Some countries collapsed under surge conditions, while others (such as Malta) showed resilience. Public health measures in Malta quickly reined in COVID-19 spread. This review summarizes pandemic preparedness measures in Malta and the impact on routine services., METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Google, Google Scholar and PubMed and by reviewing Maltese online newspapers. A comprehensive summary of internal operations conducted at Mater Dei Hospital (MDH) was made available., RESULTS: A hospital 'Incident Command Group' was set up to plan an optimal COVID-19 response strategy. A 'rapid response team' was also created to cater for the logistics and management of supplies. A 'COVID-19 Emergency Operation Centre' simulated different COVID-19 scenarios. All elective services were suspended and all staff were mandatorily trained in wearing personal protective equipment. Staff were also retrained in the care of COVID-19 patients. In preparation for potential admission surges, MDH underwent rapid expansion of normal and intensive care beds. Swabbing was ramped up to one of the highest national rates worldwide. The cost for hospital COVID-19 preparedness exceeded 100 million for Malta's half a million population., CONCLUSION: Malta and its sole acute hospital coped well with the first wave with 680 cases and 9 deaths.

{"text": "The cardiovascular aspect of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), has hit the world very hard by affecting millions of people across countries hence posing a major health threat on a global scale. This novel virus is thought to enter and cause infection in its host through the attachment of its structural protein known as the S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 with its consequences globally, it is mandatory that health caregivers and researchers across all disciplines abreast themselves with the potential effects that this novel virus may have on their fields and the medical society at large. During the infection, the cardiovascular system is affected by unknown pathomechanistic processes, hence accounting for an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among COVID-19 patients. As cardiovascular researchers, we are more concerned about the cardiovascular aspect of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Hence, this concise review addresses these aspects where CVD as a risk factor of COVID-19, the prevalence of CVDs in COVID-19, and the potential cardiovascular disorders which may evolve owing to COVID-19 are discussed. A better understanding of these issues will be pivotal to improve cardiovascular health during this SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Behavioral Immune System Responses to Coronavirus: A Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Explanation of Conformity, Warmth Toward Others and Attitudes Toward Lockdown. Behavioral immune system (BIS) describes psychological mechanisms that detect cues to infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, trigger disease-relevant responses and facilitate behavioral avoidance/escape. BIS activation elicits a perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) which can result in conformity with social norms. However, a response to superficial cues can result in aversive responses to people that pose no actual threat, leading to an aversion to unfamiliar others, and likelihood of prejudice. Pathogen-neutralizing behaviors, therefore, have implications for social interaction as well as illness behaviors and responses to health communications. In this study, we investigate how PVD influences conformity, attitudes to other people and to lockdown regulations through the lens of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). RST describes personality in terms of biologically-driven approach and avoidance motivations which support personal goals. Participants from the United Kingdom public (N = 605) completed an RST personality questionnaire and then read either (a) coronavirus morbidity-mortality statistics and current United Kingdom government lifestyle regulations, (b) just the regulations (as presented in most government publicity materials), or (c) no information at all. They all completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale to assess BIS-relevant Germ Aversion and Perceived Infectability, followed by questions measuring social conformity, warmth toward others and attitudes toward lockdown measures. Significantly lower PVD scores were observed in the no-information condition, with the other conditions showing no difference. In terms of RST, approach behaviors related to goal-drive persistence work alongside fear in explaining conformity to social norms. Reward related approach behaviors partially explained warmth toward others, indicating that social rewards gained through interaction continue to be strong drivers of behavior. We found no role for RST traits in attitudes toward lockdown. Overall, coronavirus-related behavior is not driven purely by fear, but also by social and/or protection goals regulated by approach motivation. This study presents new insights into public perceptions of coronavirus and government regulated lifestyle restrictions, helping to explain social behaviors in terms of biologically driven mechanisms. Such understanding is vital if we are to successfully motivate public behavior to constrain spread of the virus. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Bacon and Corr.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers have been at increased risk of exposure, infection and serious complications from COVID-19. Antibody testing has been used to identify staff members who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, and has been rolled out rapidly in the United Kingdom. a number of published comment and editorial articles raising concerns about antibody testing in this context. We present perceptions of NHS healthcare workers in relation to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing., METHODS: Electronic survey regarding perceptions towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing which was distributed to all healthcare workers at a major NHS tertiary hospital following implementation of antibody testing., RESULTS: In total, 560 healthcare workers completed the survey (80% female; 25% of BAME background; 58% from frontline clinical staff). Exploring whether they previously had COVID-19 was the primary reported reason for choosing to undergo antibody testing (85.2%). In case of a positive antibody test, 72% reported that they would feel relieved, whilst 48% felt that they would be happier to work in a patient-facing area. Moreover, 12% responded that a positive test would mean \"social distancing is less important\", with 34% of the responders indicating that in this case they would be both less likely to catch COVID-19 and happier to visit friends/relatives., CONCLUSIONS: NHS staff members primarily seek out SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for an appropriate reason.

BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 necessitated a scaled treatment response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the design and rapid implementation of a complex, multimodal, technology response to COVID-19 led by the Intermountain Healthcare's (Intermountain's) Care Transformation Information Systems (CTIS) organization to build pandemic surge capacity., METHODS: Intermountain has active community-spread cases of COVID-19 that are increasing. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pandemic Intervals Framework (the Framework) to characterize CTIS leadership's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 at Intermountain. We provide results on implementation feasibility and sustainability of health information technology (HIT) interventions as of June 30, 2020, characterize lessons learned and identify persistent barriers to sustained deployment., RESULTS: We characterize the CTIS organization's multimodal technology response to COVID-19 in five relevant areas of the Framework enabling (1) incident management, (2) surveillance, (3) laboratory testing, (4) community mitigation, and (5) medical care and countermeasures. We are seeing increased use of traditionally slow-to-adopt technologies that create additional surge capacity while sustaining patient safety and care quality. CTIS leadership recognized early that a multimodal technology intervention could enable additional surge capacity for health care delivery systems with a broad geographic and service scope. A statewide central tracking system to coordinate capacity planning and management response is needed. Order interoperability between health care systems remains a barrier to an integrated response., CONCLUSION: The rate of future pandemics is estimated to increase. The pandemic response of health care systems, like Intermountain, offers a blueprint for the leadership role that HIT organizations can play in mainstream care delivery, enabling a nimbler, virtual health care delivery system that is more responsive to current and future needs.

{"text": "COVID-19: The Emerging Immunopathological Determinants for Recovery or Death. Hyperactivation of the host immune system during infection by SARS-CoV-2 is the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. It is also evident that patients who develop mild/moderate symptoms and successfully recover display functional and well-regulated immune response. Whereas a delayed initial interferon response is associated with severe disease outcome and can be the tipping point towards immunopathological deterioration, often preceding death in COVID-19 patients. Further, adaptive immune response during COVID-19 is heterogeneous and poorly understood. At the same time, some studies suggest activated T and B cell response in severe and critically ill patients and the presence of SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies. Thus, understanding this problem and the underlying molecular pathways implicated in host immune function/dysfunction is imperative to devise effective therapeutic interventions. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the emerging immunopathological determinants and the mechanism of virus evasion by the host cell immune system. Using the knowledge gained from previous respiratory viruses and the emerging clinical and molecular findings on SARS-CoV-2, we have tried to provide a holistic understanding of the host innate and adaptive immune response that may determine disease outcome. Considering the critical role of the adaptive immune system during the viral clearance, we have presented the molecular insights of the plausible mechanisms involved in impaired T cell function/dysfunction during various stages of COVID-19.

{"text": "Integration of a Thermoelectric Heating Unit with Ionic Wind-Induced Droplet Centrifugation Chip to Develop Miniaturized Concentration Device for Rapid Determination of Salmonella on Food Samples Using Antibody-Functionalized SERS Tags. When a centrifugation-enriched sample of 100 muL containing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tag-bound bacteria (Salmonella in this study) is siphoned onto a glass slide next to an embedded thermoelectric heating chip, such a sessile droplet is quickly evaporated. As the size of the sample droplet is significantly reduced during the heating process, ionic wind streams from a corona discharge needle, stationed above the sample, sweep across the liquid surface to produce centrifugal vortex flow. Tag-bound Salmonella in the sample are then dragged and trapped at the center of droplet bottom. Finally, when the sample is dried, unlike the \"coffee ring\" effect, the SERS tag-bound Salmonella is concentrated in one small spot to allow sensitive detection of a Raman signal. Compared with our previous electrohydrodynamic concentration device containing only a corona discharge needle, this thermoelectric evaporation-assisted device is more time-effective, with the time of concentrating and drying about 100 muL sample reduced from 2 h to 30 min. Hence, sample throughput can be accelerated with this device for practical use. It is also more sensitive, with SERS detection of a few cells of Salmonella in neat samples achievable. We also evaluated the feasibility of using this device to detect Salmonella in food samples without performing the culturing procedures. Having spiked a few Salmonella cells into ice cubes and lettuce leaves, we use filtration and ultracentrifugation steps to obtain enriched tag-bound Salmonella samples of 200 muL. After loading an aliquot of 100 muL of sample onto this concentration device, the SERS tag signals from samples of 100 g ice cubes containing two Salmonella cells and 20 g lettuce leaf containing 5 Salmonella cells can be successfully detected.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

This study describes real-world (RW) treatment patterns in a large US claims database toward understanding new standards of care in aRCC treatment. Method(s): Using Optum Clinformatics Claims data, patients >=18 with >= 2 RCC diagnoses 30-days apart, who subsequently start first-line (1L) aRCC treatment (study index date) during April 2018 to March 2019 were all followed-for 9 months. Patients had >=2 secondary malignancy codes in the 12 months prior/30 days post-index date and 9-months of continuous enrollment pre- and post-index. Result(s): Study identified 415 1L aRCC patients. The most common 1L regimen was monotherapy tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mono TKIs) representing 43.13% (N=179). Combination IO (combo IO), monotherapy IO (mono IO), IO + TKI, and Other, represented 28.43% (N=118), 25.30% (N=105), 0.96% (N=4) and 3.13% (N=13) respectively. Combo IO patients were younger, mean age 66.58, compared to mono TKI and mono IO patients, mean age 70.15 (p=0.003) and 72.72 (p<0.001), respectively. Mean days of continuous therapy for mono TKI patients was 152.17, compared to combo IO 171.64 (p=0.034) and mono IO 173.22 (p=0.028).

Objectives: Published mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infections have varied significantly due to differences in testing and disease tracking rates across countries. The impact of population density, family size, mobility and government actions on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections is not well understood. Method(s): This is a retrospective data analysis using the Worldwide WHO situation reports along with population density information and family size information (from ), government response data (7 policies: school closure (SC), workplace closure (WC), public event cancellation (PEC), restriction on gatherings (RG), public transport closure (PTC), stay-at-home (SAH), internal movement restrictions (IMR) - Oxford University) and mobility reports (Apple) to estimate variables associated with COVID-19 mortality from countries with complete information. Poisson regression models were developed to evaluate associations between mortality counts and variables mentioned herein. A 42-day lag was applied to mobility and government response metrics to evaluate the impact thereof on mortality. Result(s): Nine countries were included in the analysis (Australia, Belgium, Chile, Italy, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Spain, UK, USA). The highest quartile of government response index had the greatest protective effect on mortality (incidence proportion ratio (IPR): 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.32). There was no consistent association impact between walking, driving or transit mobility metric. Government actions with significant protective effect were PTC (IPR: 0.46 (0.28-0.75)) and PEC (IPR: 0.65 (0.47-0.91)).

The literature has reported a higher prevalence of negative clinical outcomes due to Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in obese individuals. This can be explained by the cytokine storm, result from the cytokine production from both obesity and viral infection. Gamma-oryzanol (gammaOz) is a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, little is known about the gammaOz action as a possible agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gammaOz attenuates the cytokine storm by stimulating PPAR-gamma in the adipose tissue. Method(s): Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 30 weeks with control diet (C, n = 6), high sugar-fat diet (HSF, n = 6) or high sugar-fat diet + gammaOz (HSF + gammaOz, n = 6). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25%). The gammaOz dose was 0.5% in the chow. Evaluation in animals included caloric intake, body weight, adiposity index, plasma triglycerides, and HOMA-IR. In adipose tissue was evaluated: PPAR-gamma gene and protein expression, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters, and histological analysis. Result(s): Adipose tissue dysfunction was observed in HSF group, which presented remarkable PPAR-gamma underexpression and increased levels of cytokines, other inflammatory markers and oxidative stress. The gammaOz treatment prevented adipose tissue dysfunction and promoted PPAR-gamma overexpression. Conclusion(s): Natural compounds as gammaOz can be considered a coadjutant therapy to prevent the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with obesity conditions.Copyright \u00a9 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3 months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother-baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers' mental disorders and infants' neurobehavioral disorders. Result(s): All cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3 months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother-baby separation was 35 days (interquartile range 16 to 52 days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother-baby separation (median 8 days; IQR 5 to 23 days). The breastfeeding rate was 8.8% at 1 week after birth, 19.3% at the age of 1 month, and 36.8% at the age of 3 months, respectively.

We reviewed the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual health regarding transmission and safe sex practices, pregnancy, dating and intimacy amid the pandemic, benefits of sex, and impact on sexual dysfunctions., RESULTS: Coronavirus transmission occurs via inhalation and touching infected surfaces. Currently, there is no evidence it is sexually transmitted, but there are sexual behaviors that pose a higher risk of infectivity due to asymptomatic carriers. Nonmonogamy plays a key role in transmission hubs. New dating possibilities and intimacy issues are highlighted. Sexual activity has a positive impact on the immune response, psychological health, and cognitive function and could mitigate psychosocial stressors. COVID-19 pandemic affects indirectly the sexual function with implications on overall health., CONCLUSION: Increased awareness of health-care providers on sexual health implications related to the COVID-19 pandemic is needed.

Results As of April 1, 2020, a total of 103 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported in Guangzhou, in which 92 were confirmed cases and 11 were asymptomatic infection cases. The number of the confirmed imported cases accounted for 11.4% (92/806) in of the total in China at the same time. The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.58: 1 (63: 40). The median age of the cases was 31 years (p25-P75:22-40 years), range of age was 11-63 years. The main occupational distributions of the cases were business services (41/103, 39.8%) and students (36/103, 35.0%). The imported cases whose destinations were 19 provinces and municipalities rather than Guangdong after entering the country accounted for 43.7%. The main source countries of infections were the United Kingdom (27/103, 26.2%), the Philippines (13/103, 12.6%), the United States (13/103, 12.6%) and Nigeria (7/103, 6.8%). There were 34 inbound flights from which the imported COVID-19 cases were detected, in which 10 flights (10/34, 29.4%) were found to carry more than 3 cases, with an average voyage time of (11.14 +/- 0.53) hours. A total of 29 imported cases (28.2%) showed symptoms before entering the country, and 65 cases (63.1%) had been isolated before the onset of the disease. The mean free activity time of the isolated cases after the onset was (6.76 + 0.79) days. The average number of the imported cases' close contacts was 53. There were 13 clusters of COVID-19 caused by the imported cases, involving 36 cases (including 1 imported associated case). Conclusions The sources of the imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou were widely distributed, and no cases had been found to be infected on the flights. In the early stage of the imported epidemic, there was high risk for the spread of the epidemic. Strengthened prevention and control of imported COVID-19 effectively reduced the of transmission risk of COVID-19 in communities.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Chinese Medical Association.

{"text": "Motivations and Barriers for the Use of Face Coverings during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Messaging Insights from Focus Groups. Widespread use of face coverings is a key public health strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, few studies have examined why Americans use or do not use face coverings, and little is known about the most effective messaging strategies. This study explored perceptions of face coverings, including motivations and barriers for use, and examined reactions to messaging promoting the use of face coverings. Six virtual focus groups were conducted with 34 North Carolina residents in July 2020. Participants reported high compliance with face covering recommendations but often did not wear them around family, friends, and colleagues. The most prevalent motivation for the use of face coverings was to protect or respect other people, including high-risk populations and individuals. Other motivators were self-protection, responsibility, desire for control, requirements, and expert advice. Barriers included physical and social discomfort, confusion or misinformation, low perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceptions of identity and autonomy. Even among individuals who frequently wear face coverings, there are opportunities to improve compliance. Messaging should highlight how face coverings protect the wearer and others around them, normalize the use of face coverings in social settings, and emphasize requirements. Positive messages that focus on unity, personal experiences and the rationale for face coverings are recommended.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine in the UK. PURPOSE: COVID-19 brought about unprecedented challenges to healthcare, with nuclear medicine (NM) being no exception. The British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) COVID-19 survey assessed the impact of the first wave of pandemic on NM services in the UK. With COVID-19 resurge compounded by seasonal winter pressures, we reflect and share lessons learnt from the first wave of pandemic to guide future strategy., METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was sent out to all BNMS members over 2 weeks in May 2020, to evaluate the impact of 'lockdown'., RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight members (92 sites) from a multidisciplinary background responded. There was a 65% reduction across all services; 97.6% of respondents reported some reduction in diagnostic procedures and 71.3% reduction in therapies; 85% worked with a reduced workforce. The North East of England, Greater London and South East and Wessex were most affected by staff absences. The North East reported the highest number of COVID-19 positive staff; London reported the greatest lack of testing. The reported time required to clear the backlog was 1-12 months. Seventy-one percent of participants used BNMS COVID-19 guidance., CONCLUSION: The first wave caused a major disruption of NM service delivery and impacted on the workforce. The departmental strategies should tailor services to evolving local and regional differences in prevalence of COVID-19. A blanket shutdown of services with a 'one size fits all' strategy would likely have a severe impact on future delivery of NM and health services in general. Timely testing of staff and patients remains of paramount importance. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "No significant association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and adverse outcomes of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is commonly targeted to achieve glycemic control and has potent anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent structural analyses indicated a potential tight interaction between DPP4 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), raising a promising hypothesis that DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) drugs might be an optimal strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with diabetes. However, there has been no direct clinical evidence illuminating the associations between DPP4i use and COVID-19 outcomes., AIM: To illuminate the associations between DPP4i usage and the adverse outcomes of COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis including 2563 patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 at 16 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. After excluding ineligible individuals, 142 patients who received DPP4i drugs and 1115 patients who received non-DPP4i oral anti-diabetic drugs were included in the subsequent analysis. We performed a strict propensity score matching (PSM) analysis where age, sex, comorbidities, number of oral hypoglycemic agents, heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 95%, CT diagnosed bilateral lung lesions, laboratory indicators, and proportion of insulin usage were matched. Finally, 111 participants treated with DPP4i drugs were successfully matched to 333 non-DPP4i users. Then, a linear logistic model and mixed-effect Cox model were applied to analyze the associations between in-hospital DPP4i use and adverse outcomes of COVID-19., RESULTS: After rigorous matching and further adjustments for imbalanced variables in the linear logistic model and Cox adjusted model, we found that there was no significant association between in-hospital DPP4i use (DPP4i group) and 28-d all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.09-2.11, P = 0.31). Likewise, the incidences and risks of secondary outcomes, including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute organ (kidney, liver, and cardiac) injuries, were also comparable between the DPP4i and non-DPP4i groups. The performance of DPP4i agents in achieving glucose control (e.g., the median level of fasting blood glucose and random blood glucose) and inflammatory regulation was approximately equivalent in the DPP4i and non-DPP4i groups. Furthermore, we did not observe substantial side effects such as uncontrolled glycemia or acidosis due to DPP4i application relative to the use of non-DPP4i agents in the study cohort., CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that DPP4i use is not significantly associated with poor outcomes of COVID-19 or other adverse effects of anti-diabetic treatment. The data support the continuation of DPP4i agents for diabetes management in the setting of COVID-19. Copyright \u00a9The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Most of drugs could have certain mucocutaneous reactions and COVID-19 drugs are not an exception that we focused. We systematically reviewed databases until August/15/2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis and etc. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and etc. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Objectives: In addition to risking their physical well-being, frontline physicians are enduring significant emotional burden both at work and home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate the levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to identify associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak., Methods and design: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between April 21 and May 10, 2020. Outcomes assessed included demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)., Results: The survey was completed by 412 Bangladeshi physicians. The findings revealed that, in terms of standardized HADS cut-off points, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians was 67.72% and 48.5% respectively. Risk factors for higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms were: being female, physicians who had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic, those who had not received incentives, those who used self-funded PPE, not received adequate training, lacking perceived self-efficacy to manage COVID -19 positive patients, greater perceived stress of being infected, fear of getting assaulted/humiliated, being more connected with social media, having lower income levels to support the family, feeling more agitated, less than 2 hours of leisure activity per day and short sleep duration. All these factors were found to be positively associated with anxiety and depression in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models., Conclusions: This study identifies a real concern about the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among Bangladeshi physicians and identifies several associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the vulnerability of the physicians in this extraordinary period whilst they are putting their own lives at risk to help people infected by COVID-19, health authorities should address the psychological needs of medical staff and formulate effective strategies to support vital frontline health workers., STHRENGHTS & LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY: This study reports a novel and concerning findings on the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms with identification of several important associated factors among Bangladeshi physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional nature of the study design could not establish causal relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

{"text": "Self-efficacy and fatigue among non-frontline health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak: A moderated mediation model of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and negative coping. PURPOSES: Since a considerable number of health care workers (HCWs) were sent to Wuhan to aid COVID-19 control during the epidemic, non-frontline HCWs who stayed in local hospitals had to work overload to provide daily health care services for other health issues, which makes them more vulnerable to experience fatigue. Self-efficacy is suggested as a protective factor for fatigue. Nonetheless, less is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. This research aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs during the pandemic, investigate the mediating effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and moderating effect of negative coping in the association between self-efficacy and fatigue., METHODS: General Self-Efficacy Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and 14-item Fatigue Scale were administrated to 527 non-frontline HCWs from Anhui Province, China. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon's four-step procedure, while Hayes PROCESS macro was used to test the moderated mediation model., RESULTS: The prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs was 56.7%. The effect of self-efficacy on fatigue was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms (ab = -0.146, SE = 0.030, 95% CI = [-0.207, -0.095]). Additionally, negative coping moderated both the direct effect of self-efficacy on fatigue (beta = -0.158, P<0.001) and the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms (beta = 0.077, P = 0.008). When the standard score of negative coping increased to 1.49 and over, the direct association between self-efficacy and fatigue became insignificant. Likewise, the effect of self-efficacy on PTSD symptoms had no statistical significance when the standard score of negative coping was -1.40 and lower., CONCLUSIONS: More than half non-frontline HCWs suffered from fatigue during COVID-19. For those who tend to use negative coping, it might be crucial to design programs combining the enhancement of self-efficacy, preventions for PTSD symptoms and interventions for fatigue.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Dysregulated Interferon Response Underlying Severe COVID-19. Innate immune interferons (IFNs), including type I and III IFNs, constitute critical antiviral mechanisms. Recent studies reveal that IFN dysregulation is key to determine COVID-19 pathogenesis. Effective IFN stimulation or prophylactic administration of IFNs at the early stage prior to severe COVID-19 may elicit an autonomous antiviral state, restrict the virus infection, and prevent COVID-19 progression. Inborn genetic flaws and autoreactive antibodies that block IFN response have been significantly associated with about 14% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In most severe COVID-19 patients without genetic errors in IFN-relevant gene loci, IFN dysregulation is progressively worsened and associated with the situation of pro-inflammation and immunopathy, which is prone to autoimmunity. In addition, the high correlation of severe COVID-19 with seniority, males, and individuals with pre-existing comorbidities will be plausibly explained by the coincidence of IFN aberrance in these situations. Collectively, current studies call for a better understanding of the IFN response regarding the spatiotemporal determination and subtype-specificity against SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are warranted to devise IFN-related prophylactics and therapies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Healthy donors examined during the pandemic exhibited increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but no humoral response. Their probable exposure to the virus resulted in either asymptomatic infection without antibody secretion or activation of preexisting immunity. In convalescent patients, we observed a public and diverse T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing T cell receptor (TCR) motifs with germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the spike protein were mediated by groups of homologous TCRs, some of them shared across multiple donors.

The accurate and rapid screening of serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the key to control the spread of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, we reported a surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG with high sensitivity. Novel SERS tags labeled with dual layers of Raman dye were fabricated by coating a complete Ag shell on SiO2 core (SiO2@Ag) and exhibited excellent SERS signals, good monodispersity, and high stability. Anti-human IgM and IgG were immobilized onto the two test lines of the strip to capture the formed SiO2@Ag-spike (S) protein-anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG immunocomplexes. The SERS signal intensities of the IgM and IgG test zones were easily recorded by a portable Raman instrument and used for the high-sensitivity analysis of target IgM and IgG. The limit of detection of SERS-LFIA was 800 times higher than that of standard Au nanoparticle-based LFIA for target IgM and IgG. The SERS-LFIA biosensor was tested on 19 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 49 negative serum samples from healthy people to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of our proposed assay.

The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein, as well as the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients, needs further longitudinal investigation. Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed, validated and applied in three patients of a family which underwent an ambulatory course of COVID-19 for six months. The virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks. Serum IgA levels to the S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau at approximately six weeks, and stayed elevated over the observation period.

The level of neutralizing antibodies vary among convalescent patients and fast and simple methods to identify suitable plasma donations are needed. We compared three methods to determine the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of human convalescent plasma: life virus neutralization by plaque reduction assay, a lentiviral vector based pseudotype neutralization assay and a competition ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT). Neutralization activity correlated among the different assays; however the sVNT assay was overvaluing the low neutralizing plasma. On the other hand, the sVNT assay required the lowest biosafety level, is fast and is sufficient to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples. Though weakly neutralizing samples were more reliable detected by the more challenging lentiviral vector based assays or virus neutralization assays. Spike receptor binding competition assays are suitable to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples under low biosafety requirements.

We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site. The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8. The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Although some evidence showed the activation of complement systems in COVID-19 patients, proinflammatory status and lectin pathway remain unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the role of MBL and ficolin-3 in the complement system activation and compared to pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype infection (H1N1pdm09) and control patients. A total of 27 lungs formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (10 from H1N1 group, 6 from the COVID-19 group, and 11 from the control group) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-IL-6, TNF-alfa, CD163, MBL e FCN3 antibodies. Genotyping of target polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene was performed by real-time PCR. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha presented higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups. The same results were observed for ICAM-1 tissue expression. Increased expression of the FCN3 was observed in the COVID-19 group and H1N1 group compared to the control group. The MBL tissue expression was higher in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups. The genotypes AA for rs180040 (G/A), GG for rs1800451 (G/A) and CC for rs5030737 (T/C) showed a higher prevalence in the COVID-19 group. The intense activation of the lectin pathway, with particular emphasis on the MBL pathway, together with endothelial dysfunction and a massive proinflammatory cytokines production, possibly lead to a worse outcome in patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. Moreover, 3 SNPs of our study presented genotypes that might be correlated with high MBL tissue expression in the COVID-19 pulmonary samples. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

{"text": "Dysregulated ACE2 and Furin Activity amongst Smokers Increase Disease Susceptibility Towards SARS-CoV2. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has brought infected millions worldwide. Over 6 million individuals in the US have been infected by the SARS-CoV2 making it the worst-hit country across the globe. While there is an urgent need to find a potential therapy/vaccine it is important to understand the disease progression and susceptibilities to enable better the disease management. In this respect, smokers or vapers could be considered as the worst affected population as they are highly prone to respiratory infections. However, the clinical data relating COVID-19 occurrence and severity amongst smokers/vapers is quite limited. We thus hypothesized that dysregulated ACE2 expression and weakened immunity could result in severe disease outcomes amongst smokers. To test this hypothesis, we collected the blood serum samples from COVID19 positive and COVID-19 recovered patients with and without a smoking history. We assayed the expression and activity of ACE2. ACE2 is the membrane-bound receptor on pneumocytes and lung epithelium that binds to the SARS-CoV2 spike protein and is responsible for the viral entry into the host cell. This viral entry and fusion occur due to the activity of membrane proteases like furin and TMPRSS2. Result(s): Our initial investigations show increased Furin activity amongst the COVID19 positive patients with a smoking history as compared to the non-smoking controls. We further observed a significant dysregulation in the ACE2 activity of COVID-19 patients as compared to COVID-19 recovered patient group. Smoking habit was found to dramatically affect the ACE2 activity amongst COVID-19 positive group. We are presently comparing the expression levels of systemic inflammatory mediators (IL8 and IL6) amongst our various experimental groups to compare the severity of inflammatory responses amongst smokers and non-smokers. Overall, our findings show that the onset and progression of COVID-19 varies amongst smokers doi: xxxxxCopyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The legacy of MeNZB and possible implications for COVID-19 vaccination. It is now over a decade since the meningococcal B vaccine, MeNZB, was in routine use in New Zealand. From July 2004 until June 2008 it was administered in a three-dose schedule to over a million individuals, aged six weeks to 20 years, to provide protection against the epidemic strain of group B Meningococci. The cost of the campaign, including the development of the vaccine was substantial, in excess of $200M, but it contributed to a reduced incidence of meningococcal infections along with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The campaign led to the development of a national immunisation register (NIR), which is still in existence today. As well as considering the legacies of the MeNZB vaccination programme, this paper examines whether there are any lessons to be learned, specifically concerning active vaccine safety monitoring, which may be important if, and when, a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and a national immunisation campaign instituted.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in follicular and endocervical fluid of IVF candidates with positive PCR tests. Introduction & Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique global challenge with a wide range of severity extending from an asymptomatic form to a serious intense respiratory syndrome. We have restarted the ART treatments in cases that need emergent IVF treatment according to the international and local guidelines. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of viruses in follicular and endocervical fluid in patients with a positive PCR tests provided on the day of the oocyte trigger. Method(s): All participants and their partners, who were a candidate to start ART from April 2020 to October 2020, completed a triage questionnaire two weeks before starting the ART cycle. A PCR test was performed for all participants before starting the cycle. According to Avicenna center protocol, a diagnostic test (real-time PCR) by Dacron swap and Pishtazteb kit. The nasopharynx test for COVID-19 was conducted for all ART patients 48 hours before the day of the oocyte trigger. PCR test was positive in 32 women. In the operating theater, sterile swabs were used to provide cervicovaginal specimens to determine COVID 19 virus in cervicovaginal fluid. Also, the first aspirated follicular fluid was referred to the lab to assess the presence of COVID 19. Result(s): In this study, virus particles were not detected in the follicular and endocervical fluid of the women with positive PCR tests. Case presentation: We describe 32 patients who were candidates for IVF, with approved positive COVID-19 PCR tests to evaluate whether the virus is present in the follicular and endocervical fluid or not? Discussion: We are still at the beginning of the road and need reliable data on the safety of the ART at the time of pandemic. The risk of infection during all process of ART including oocyte retrieval needs attention. The fluids from mature follicles are a potential site to be infected and the human cumulus cells could not be a deterrent factor to entrance of the virus in the oocyte. This process may lead to gametes infection. Indeed in real life evaluating the risk of sexual transmission of COVID-19 is very important. Conclusion(s): We did not detect virus RNA in the follicular and endocervical fluid of the patients with positive PCR test. Although, more studies with a greater sample size are mandatory in this field.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Giving birth under hospital visitor restrictions: Heightened acute stress in childbirth in COVID-19 positive women. As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread globally, a significant portion of women have undergone childbirth while possibly infected with the virus and also under social isolation due to hospital visitor restrictions. Emerging studies examined birth outcomes in COVID-19 positive women, but knowledge of the psychological experience of childbirth remains lacking. This study survey concerning childbirth and mental health launched during the first wave of the pandemic in the US. Women reporting confirmed/suspected COVID-19 during childbirth were matched on various background factors with women reporting COVID-19 negative. We found higher prevalence of clinically significant acute stress in birth in COVID-19 positive women. This group was 11 times as likely to have no visitors than matched controls and reported higher levels of pain in delivery, lower newborn weights, and more infant admission to neonatal intensive care units. Visitor restrictions were associated with these birth outcomes. COVID-19 positive women with no visitors were 6 times as likely to report clinical acute stress in birth than COVID-19 positive women with visitors. The findings underscore increased risk for childbirth-induced psychological morbidity in COVID-19-affected populations.

Introduction: COVID-19 is a global pandemic seen in modern times. The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana., Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization., Results: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3degreeC, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24 +/- 1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration of hospitalization for patients who received AZ only was 2.7 days, which was higher than that of patients who received AZ+CQ and HCQ only (95% CI 0.44, 4.93; p=0.019)., Conclusion: in this cohort of COVID-19 patients, the common symptoms were cough, fever, headache, and sore throat.

{"text": "Use of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registries to assess COVID-19 home mortality. BACKGROUND: In most countries, the official statistics for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) take account of in-hospital deaths but not those that occur at home. The study's objective was to introduce a methodology to assess COVID-19 home deaths by analysing the French national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) registry (ReAC)., METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study based on data recorded in the ReAC by 20 mobile medical teams (MMTs) between March 1st and April 15th, 2020. The participating MMTs covered 10.1% of the French population. OHCA patients were classified as probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases or as non-COVID-19 cases. To achieve our primary objective, we computed the incidence and survival at hospital admission of cases of COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. Cardiac arrests that occurred in retirement homes or public places were excluded. Hence, we estimated the number of at-home COVID-19-related deaths that were not accounted for in the French national statistics., RESULTS: We included 670 patients with OHCA. The extrapolated annual incidence of OHCA per 100,000 inhabitants was 91.9 overall and 17.6 for COVID-19 OHCA occurring at home. In the latter group, the survival rate after being taken to the hospital after an OHCA was 10.9%. We estimated that 1322 deaths were not accounted in the French national statistics on April 15, 2020., CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of COVID-19 out-of-hospital deaths to in-hospital deaths was 12.4%, and so the national statistics underestimated the death rate.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Several studies report that ABO blood group polymorphism may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes; however, the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether ABO blood groups are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A total of 715 articles were retrieved from seven databases. Ten articles were selected for meta-analysis after removal of duplicates and two levels of screenings. Overall, individuals with blood group A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.56] and B (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) had a substantially higher risk of COVID-19, whereas this was not the case for blood group AB (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30). Individuals with blood group O was not prone to develop the disease (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the Rh-positive blood group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). A meta-analysis of 5 studies suggested that blood group A was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52). Mild publication bias was found in the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that blood groups A and B may be risk factors for COVID-19, whereas the blood group O appears to be protective. Blood group A may be related to unfavourable outcomes. Further rigorous and high-quality research evidence is needed to confirm this association. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Identification of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases using cohort-based testing approaches at a large correctional facility - Chicago, Illinois, USA, May 2020. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Correctional and detention facilities are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks. We aimed to evaluate cohort-based testing among detained persons exposed to laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in order to identify presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases., METHODS: During May 1-19, 2020, two testing strategies were implemented in 12 tiers or housing units of the Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois. Detained persons were approached to participate in serial testing (n=137) tests at 3 time points over 14 days (day 1, day 3-5, and day 13-14). The second group was offered a single test and interview at the end of a 14-day quarantine period (day 14 group) (n=87)., RESULTS: A total of 224 detained persons were approached for participation and of these 194 (87%) participated in at least one interview, and 172 (77%) had at least one test. Of the 172 tested, 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the serial testing group, 17 (89%) new cases were detected, sixteen (84%) on day 1, one (5%) on days 3-5, and none on days 13-14; and, in day 14 group, two (11%) cases were identified. More than half (12/19; 63%) of the newly identified cases were pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic., CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the utility of cohort-based testing promptly after initiating quarantine within a housing tier. Cohort-based testing efforts identified new SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections that may have been missed by symptom screening alone.

BACKGROUND: Most patients including health care workers (HCWs) survived the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, knowledge about the sequelae of COVID-19 after discharge remains limited., METHODS: A prospectively observational 3-month follow-up study evaluated symptoms, dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG and IgM, lung function, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of survivors of COVID-19 after discharge at Wuhan Union Hospital, China., RESULTS: Seventy-six survivors (55 females) with a mean age of 41.3 +/- 13.8 years were enrolled, and 65 (86%) were HCWs. A total of 69 (91%) patients had returned to their original work at 3-months after discharge. Most of the survivors had symptoms including fever, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness on exertion and palpitations in the three months after discharge. The serum troponin-I levels during the acute illness showed high correlation with the symptom of fatigue after hospital discharge (r = 0.782; P = 0.008) and lymphopenia was correlated with the symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations on exertion of patients after hospital discharge (r = -.285, P = 0.027; r = -.363, P = 0.004, respectively). The mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity and diffusion capacity were all normal (> 80% predicted) and lung HRCTs returned to normal in most of the patients (82%), however, 42% of survivors had mild pulmonary function abnormalities at 3-months after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 IgG turned negative in 11% (6 of 57 patients), 8% (4 of 52 patients) and 13% (7 of 55 patients), and SARS-CoV-2 IgM turned negative in 72% (41 of 57 patients), 85% (44 of 52 patients) and 87% (48 of 55 patients) at 1-month, 2-months and 3-months after discharge, respectively., CONCLUSION: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 caused some mild impairments of survivors within the first three months of their discharge and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was limited, which indicates the necessity of long-term follow-up of survivors of COVID-19.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and virus-laden aerosol size distributions in outdoor air in north and south of Italy. The COVID-19 disease spread at different rates in the different countries and in different regions of the same country, as happened in Italy. Transmission by contact or at close range due to large respiratory droplets is widely accepted, however, the role of airborne transmission due to small respiratory droplets emitted by infected individuals (also asymptomatic) is controversial. It was suggested that outdoor airborne transmission could play a role in determining the differences observed in the spread rate. Concentrations of virus-laden aerosol are still poorly known and contrasting results are reported, especially for outdoor environments. Here we investigated outdoor concentrations and size distributions of virus-laden aerosol simultaneously collected during the pandemic, in May 2020, in northern (Veneto) and southern (Apulia) regions of Italy. The two regions exhibited significantly different prevalence of COVID-19. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (RNA) was determined, using both real time RT-PCR and ddPCR, in air samples collected using PM10 samplers and cascade impactors able to separate 12 size ranges from nanoparticles (diameter D < 0.056 microm) up to coarse particles (D > 18 microm). Air samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at both sites, viral particles concentrations were <0.8 copies m-3 in PM10 and <0.4 copies m-3 in each size range investigated. Outdoor air in residential and urban areas was generally not infectious and safe for the public in both northern and southern Italy, with the possible exclusion of very crowded sites. Therefore, it is likely that outdoor airborne transmission does not explain the difference in the spread of COVID-19 observed in the two Italian regions. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread globally since December 2019 from Wuhan, China. Headache has been observed as one of the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify studies published between December 2019 and March 2020. Adult (>=18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020182529). Results: We identified 2,055 studies, of which 86 studies (n = 14,275, 49.4% female) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients was 10.1% [95% CI: 8.76-11.49]. There was no significant difference of headache prevalence in severe or critical vs. non-severe (RR: 1.05, p = 0.78), survived (recovered or discharged) vs. non-survived (RR: 1.36, p = 0.23), and ICU vs. non-ICU (RR: 1.06, p = 0.87) COVID-19 patients. We detected 64.0, 34.9, and 1.1% of the included studies as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively.

COVID-19, that emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Italy has become one of the largest epicentres outside Asia, accounting now for at least 80,539 infections (cumulative incidence of 95.9/100,000) and 8,165 deaths (case fatality rate 10.1%). It has seriously affected people above the age of 60 years. The International Health Regulations (IHR) revised in 2005 bind governments to disclose vital information regarding the identification and detection of new disease outbreaks regardless of its causative agent. In contrast to the previous SARS epidemic, China timely informed the world about the onset of a new outbreak. It also soon disclosed the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite the fast recognition of the Chinese epidemic, the application of the 2005 IHR was not followed by an effective response in every country and most health authorities failed to rapidly perceive the threat posed by COVID-19. To further complicate matters, IHR implementation, which relies primarily on self-reporting data rather than on an external review mechanism, was limited in speed and further hindered by high costs. The response in Italy suffered from several limitations within the health system and services. The action against this threat must instead be quick, firm and at the highest trans-national level. The solution lies in further strengthening countries' preparedness through a clear political commitment, mobilization of proper resources and implementation of a strict surveillance and monitoring process.

The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research including several clinical trials, currently there are no completely safe or effective therapeutics to cure the disease. Here we report a strategy incorporating neutralizing antibodies conjugated on the surface of a photothermal nanoparticle to actively capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The photothermal nanoparticle is comprised of a semiconducting polymer core and a biocompatible polyethylene glycol surface decorated with neutralizing antibodies. Such nanoparticles displayed efficient capture of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, excellent photothermal effect, and complete inhibition of viral entry into ACE2-expressing host cells via simultaneous blocking and inactivating of the virus. This photothermal nanoparticle is a flexible platform that can be readily adapted to other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and extended to novel therapeutic proteins, thus providing a broad range of protection against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "CD147-spike protein is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells. In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein. Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection. Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification. Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment. Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice. Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient. Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab. Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis. Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of triage to identify COVID-19 among patients with cancer., METHODS: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, data were collected from patients who were treated or followed at the authors' institution in a prospective clinical trial. The primary endpoint was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-positive patients who were identified using a triage process through the aid of medical and patient questionnaires. Based on a diagnostic algorithm, patients with suspect symptoms underwent an infectious disease specialist's evaluation and a COVID-19 swab. Serologic tests were proposed for patients who had symptoms or altered laboratory tests that did not fall into the diagnostic algorithm but were suspicious for COVID-19., RESULTS: Overall, 562 patients were enrolled. Six patients (1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (67%) had the disease detected through telehealth triage, and 2 patients (33%) without suspect symptoms at triage had the disease detected later. Seventy-one patients (13%) had suspect symptoms and/or altered laboratory tests that were not included in the diagnostic algorithm and, of these, 47 patients (73%) underwent testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: 6 (13%) were positive for IgG (n = 5) or for both IgM and IgG (n = 1), and antibody tests were negative in the remaining 41 patients., CONCLUSIONS: The triage process had a positive effect on the detection of COVID-19 in patients with cancer.

{"text": "A COVID-19 Prophylaxis? Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of Ivermectin. As COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, incidence varies greatly among different countries. These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.

{"text": "The virology of SARS-CoV-2. The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has far reaching effects on society, the economy and medical treatment. It is all the more important to understand the characteristics of the virus and to utilize them diagnostically, therapeutically and epidemiologically. This article firstly elucidates the medical importance of coronaviruses in general. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and the possible influence on the disease susceptibility are explained. The gold standard for detection of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection is the direct detection of the pathogen with nucleic acid amplification techniques. At the onset of symptoms, a swab of the upper airway is especially suitable due to the high viral load. At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or a stool or anal swab. Antigen or antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies are of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated. In addition, the importance of these antibodies with respect to immunity against a second infection is uncertain. Thanks to modern techniques thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences are already available, which show a genomic variability. The D614G mutation in the S spikes seems to cause a higher infectiosity. Mutations can impair the diagnostics and treatment, which makes monitoring necessary.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Co-infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus enhances the severity of pneumonia in golden Syrian hamsters. BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of the interaction between the co-circulating pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and seasonal influenza viruses are unknown. METHOD(S): We established a golden Syrian hamster model co-infected by SARS-CoV-2 and mouse-adapted A(H1N1)pdm09 simultaneously or sequentially. The weight loss, clinical scores, histopathological changes, viral load and titer, and serum neutralizing antibody titre were compared with hamsters challenged by either virus. RESULT(S): Co-infected hamsters had more weight loss, more severe lung inflammatory damage and tissue cytokine/chemokine expression. Lung viral load, infectious virus titers and virus antigen expression suggested that hamsters were generally more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequential co-infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 exposure resulted in a lower lung SARS-CoV-2 titer and viral load than with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone, but a higher lung A(H1N1)pdm09 viral load. Co-infection also increased intestinal inflammation with more SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein expression in enterocytes. Simultaneous co-infection was associated with delay in resolution of lung damages, lower serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and longer SARS-CoV-2 shedding in oral swabs compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. CONCLUSION(S): Simultaneous or sequential co-infection by SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more severe disease than infection by either virus in hamsters. Prior A(H1N1)pdm09 infection lowered SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary viral loads but enhanced lung damage. Whole-population influenza vaccination for prevention of co-infection, and multiplex molecular diagnostics for both viruses to achieve early initiation of antiviral treatment for improvement of clinical outcome should be considered.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "An insight into the interaction between alpha-ketoamide- based inhibitor and coronavirus main protease: A detailed in silico study. The search for therapeutic drugs that can neutralize the effects of COVID-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the main focus of current research. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, alpha-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of alpha-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 SgammaH) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the alpha-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 SgammaH to His41 Ndelta forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the alpha-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the alpha-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal. We computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all stationary points including transition states via ONIOM and pure DFT method. Additionally, to characterize covalent, weak noncovalent interaction (NCI) and hydrogen-bonds, we applied NCI-reduced density gradient (NCI-RDG) methods along with Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms-in-Molecules (QTAIM) and natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis.

{"text": "More that ACE2? NRP1 may play a central role in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 and its association with enhanced survival. Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction; obstruction of the olfactory cleft; epithelial injury and infection of the sustentacular supporting cells, which are known to express ACE2, or injury to the olfactory bulb due to axonal transport through olfactory sensory neurones. The absence of ACE2 expression by olfactory sensory neurones has led to the neurotropic potential of COVID-19 to be discounted. While an accumulating body of evidence supports olfactory epithelial injury as an important mechanism, this does not account for all the features of olfactory dysfunction seen in COVID-19; for example the duration of loss in some patients, evidence of changes within the olfactory bulb on MRI imaging, identification of viral particles within the olfactory bulb in post-mortem specimens and the inverse association between severity of COVID-19 and the prevalence of olfactory loss. The recent identification of a second route of viral entry mediated by NRP1 addresses many of these inconsistencies. Expression by the olfactory sensory neurones and their progenitor cells may facilitate direct injury and axonal transport to the olfactory bulb as well as a mechanism for delayed or absent recovery. Expression by regulatory T cells may play a central role in the cytokine storm. Variability in expression by age, race or gender may explain differing morbidity of infection and inverse association between anosmia and severity; in the case of higher expression there may be a higher risk of olfactory function but greater activation of regulatory T cells that may suppress the cytokine storm.

INTRODUCTION: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces COVID-19 along with venous thromboembolic occurrences particularly in intensive care units. For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients., METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS., RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0-11)., DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.

{"text": "Prevention and treatment of COVID-19: Focus on interferons, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and vaccine. The ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has drawn the attention of researchers and clinicians from several disciplines and sectors who are trying to find durable solutions both at preventive and treatment levels. To date, there is no approved effective treatment or vaccine available to control the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The preliminary in vitro studies on viral infection models showed potential antiviral activities of type I and III interferons (IFNs), chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and azithromycin (AZM); however, the clinical studies on COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ and AZM led to controversies in different regions due to their adverse side effects, as well as their combined treatment could prolong the QT interval. Interestingly, the treatment with type I IFNs showed encouraging results. Moreover, the different preliminary reports of COVID-19 candidate vaccines showcase promising results by inducing the production of a high level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and specific T cell-mediated immune response in almost all participants. The present review aims to summarize and analyze the recent progress evidence concerning the use of IFNs, CQ/HCQ, and AZM for the treatment of COVID-19. The available data on immunization options to prevent the COVID-19 are also analyzed with the aim to present the promising options which could be investigated in future for sustainable control of the pandemic.

{"text": "Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: An ecological study. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions with COVID-19 mortality in Colombia., METHODS: We performed an ecological study using data at the municipality level. We used COVID-19 data obtained from government public reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. We defined PM2.5 long-term exposure as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fitted a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions., RESULTS: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR = 3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR = 1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality., CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality. The use of model-based estimations of long-term PM2.5 exposure includes an undetermined level of uncertainty in the results, and therefore they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence.

{"text": "Timing and outcomes of testicular torsion during the COVID-19 crisis. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 crisis, there has been widespread reporting that non-COVID-19-related medical care has been delayed, even for emergent conditions. Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion., RESULTS: Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 h [IQR 1.1 h-38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 h [IQR 1.6-16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 0.476). Time to presentation was >12 h in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 1.00). Median ischemic time during COVID-19 was 7.5 h (IQR 4.7 h-45.5 h) compared to 9.4 h (IQR 5.4 h-22.5 h) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.694). Incidence of orchiectomy in our center was 29% (5/17) during COVID-19 and 17% (13/77) during pre-COVID-19 period (p = 0.397). About half of patients were seen initially at outside facilities prior to arrival (47% [8/17] during COVID-19 vs. 49% [38/77] during pre-COVID-19 period, p = 1.00). The number of torsion case presentations per week to our facility increased from 0.7 cases/week in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.015); when comparing only the March 1 to May 31 calendar period, there were 0.6 cases/week during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p = 0.021)., CONCLUSION: Time to presentation, ischemic times, and orchiectomy rates for testicular torsion at our center were not significantly different during the COVID-19 period compared to the preceding 2 year period.

Background The susceptibility of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and the risks or benefits related to the use of biological therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Few data about prevalence, clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 among psoriatic patients were reported. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents during the first phase of the emergency (22 February to 22 April 2020) in Italy, and 2) to report the clinical outcomes of patients who have been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, aged >=18 years and undergoing treatment with biologic agents as of 22 February 2020, were eligible to be included in PSO-BIO-COVID study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients using any biologic for psoriasis treatment between 22 February and 22 April 2020 were registered. For all confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, data about concomitant disease, ongoing therapies, and comorbidities were also reported. Results A total of 12,807 psoriatic patients were included in the PSO-BIO-COVID study. In this cohort twenty-six patients (0.2%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eleven patients required hospitalization and two died. 125 of 12807 patients (1.0%) with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 under quarantine or active health surveillance, were reported. Conclusion The incidence of COVID-19 observed in our cohort of psoriatic patients (0.2%) is similar to that seen in the general population (0.31%) in Italy.

{"text": "Unusual gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19: two case reports. As of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, following an epidemic of a fast-spreading viral respiratory disease, later called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which then lead to the present pandemic the world has come to know. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. It has become evident that the ACE2 receptor plays a significant role as the entry site into human cells for the virus. This receptor is generally expressed in respiratory cells, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, corresponding with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Studies concluded that the origin of gastrointestinal symptoms could be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells through the ACE2 receptor. The findings of the present study support this theory, as both patients presented with symptoms regarding tissues with high ACE2 expression.

In the follow-up, the patient continued to have asthenia and muscle weakness despite steroid therapy. She is still in follow-up and will be further evaluated over time.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals following diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Further, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be two-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were on average fifteen times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target. Thus, dimeric IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: Childhood food insecurity endangers child development and health outcomes. Food insecurity will grow increasingly common in the economic wake of the coronavirus pandemic and prenatal care represents an early, clinical opportunity to identify families at risk. However, longitudinal relationships between clinically-identified prenatal food insecurity and prematurity, pediatric health care utilization, and postnatal social needs have not been described., METHODS: We examined longitudinal data from mother-child dyads who received prenatal and pediatric care and social needs screening at a large academically-affiliated safety net medical center between October 2018 and July 2019. Associations among household food insecurity and premature birth, pediatric inpatient and outpatient utilization, missed immunizations, and postnatal social needs were estimated using adjusted regression., RESULTS: Among the 268 mothers, those who experienced prenatal household food insecurity had 3 times higher odds of having a child born prematurely (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.9, p=0.05) and had children with higher inpatient hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6, p=0.04) and missed immunizations (IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.3, p=0.03) in the first 6 months of the child's life.

Mutational clusters were assessed by hierarchical clustering. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was used to select the best inhibitors of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-Pr) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the FDA-approved drugs and to evaluate the impact of mutations on binding affinity of these drugs. The impact of mutations on epitope recognition was predicted following Grifoni et al. (Cell Host Microbe 2020., 27: 671-80.)., RESULTS: Thirty-five key mutations were identified (prevalence: >=0.5%), residing in different viral proteins. Sixteen out of 35 formed tight clusters involving multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, highlighting intergenic co-evolution. Some clusters (including D614GSpike + P323LRdRp + R203KN + G204RN) occurred in all continents, while others showed a geographically restricted circulation (T1198KPL-Pr + P13LN + A97VRdRp in Asia, L84SORF-8 + S197LN in Europe, Y541CHel + H504CHel + L84SORF-8 in America and Oceania). SBVS identified 20 best RdRp inhibitors and 21 best 3CL-Pr inhibitors belonging to different drug classes. Notably, mutations in RdRp or 3CL-Pr modulate, positively or negatively, the binding affinity of these drugs. Among them, P323LRdRp (prevalence: 61.9%) reduced the binding affinity of specific compounds including remdesivir while it increased the binding affinity of the purine analogues penciclovir and tenofovir, suggesting potential hypersusceptibility. Finally, specific mutations (including Y541CHel + H504CHel) strongly hampered recognition of Class I/II epitopes, while D614GSpike profoundly altered the structural stability of a recently identified B cell epitope target of neutralizing antibodies (amino acids 592-620)., CONCLUSIONS: Key genetic elements reflect geographically dependent SARS-CoV-2 genetic adaptation, and may play a potential role in modulating drug susceptibility and hampering viral antigenicity. Thus, a close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 mutational patterns is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines worldwide. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The prevalence of probable clinically relevant anxiety was 61% and 45% at the first and second time points, and more than half of the participants in this anxiety group also reported mild to severe sleep disturbance. Moreover, 41% of the participants perceived themselves as not having enough COVID-19-related information and reported higher levels of COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance over time than those who perceived themselves as having enough of such information. Moderated mediation analysis identified two groups who were more vulnerable to both psychological problems: high blunters who sought COVID-19-related information online more frequently and high monitors who sought such information offline less frequently.

{"text": "Simple Questionnaires to Improve Pooling Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Laboratory Testing. Background: Liberal PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Combined multi-sample testing in pools instead of single tests might enhance laboratory capacity and reduce costs, especially in low- and middle-income countries., Objective: The purpose of our study was to assess the value of a simple questionnaire to guide and further improve pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing., Methods: Pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing were obtained from healthcare and police staff, hospital inpatients, and nursing home residents in the southwestern part of Germany. We designed a simple questionnaire, which included questions pertaining to a suggestive clinical symptomatology, recent travel history, and contact with confirmed cases to stratify an individual's pre-test probability of having contracted COVID-19. The questionnaire was adapted repeatedly in face of the unfolding pandemic in response to the evolving epidemiology and observed clinical symptomatology. Based on the response patterns, samples were either tested individually or in multi-sample pools. We compared the pool positivity rate and the number of total PCR tests required to obtain individual results between this questionnaire-based pooling strategy and randomly assembled pools., Findings: Between March 11 and July 5, 2020, we processed 25,978 samples using random pooling (n = 6,012; 23.1%) or questionnaire-based pooling (n = 19,966; 76.9%). The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.9% (n = 238). Pool positivity (14.6% vs. 1.2%) and individual SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (3.4% vs. 0.1%) were higher in the random pooling group than in the questionnaire group. The average number of PCR tests needed to obtain the individual result for one participant was 0.27 tests in the random pooling group, as compared to 0.09 in the questionnaire-based pooling group, leading to a laboratory capacity increase of 73% and 91%, respectively, as compared to single PCR testing., Conclusions: Strategies that combine pool testing with a questionnaire-based risk stratification can increase laboratory testing capacities for COVID-19 and might be important tools, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Recent pandemic of corona virus disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in humans is the third outbreak by this family of viruses, which is reminiscent of the SARS-COV outbreak happened in the year 2003. General characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) especially in regards to the disease susceptibility amongst males and females have been focused providing a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in males, females and children. A thorough literature search for articles in major databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar etc. has been carried out. COVID-19 has been known to have varied symptoms ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Ageing, genetics, comorbidities and many other associated factors may play a crucial role in predisposing an individual towards COVID-19 disease as there exists chronic inflammation, thrombosis and immune response impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 providing a therapeutic window. Current study emphasizes upon the role of gender in morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 with men higher at risk to COVID-19 than women in terms of mortality despite having the similar prevalence of the disease. The study has been well supported by the data available from the hot-spots affected states from Indian subcontinent. However, current evidence is not sufficient to conclude on the gender-bias susceptibility but certainly men have an edge over women in terms of susceptibility towards COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The gastrointestinal system may be affected by COVID-19 infection with an incidence variable from 3% up to 79%. Several works show that the pancreas, both in its exocrine and endocrine function, can be affected by this viral infection, although this organ has been poorly analyzed in this current epidemic context. This mini-review aims to provide a summary of available studies on exocrine pancreas involvement during COVID-19 infection. A search through MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted on the topic in hand. With regard to exocrine function, some studies highlight the presence of an associated hyperenzymemia (hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia), while others describe isolated and rare cases of acute pancreatitis. More attention should be paid to pancreatic impairment in subjects with COVID-19, as this may prove to be one of the elements aggravating its clinical course.

{"text": "From Influenza Virus to Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2)-The Contribution of Obesity. From the beginning of 2020, the governments and the health systems around the world are tackling infections and fatalities caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a \"cytokine storm\" and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals. We look at the many lessons learnt from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic and relate it to the very little but fast incoming information that is available from the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with overweight and obesity.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Bhattacharya, Ghayor, Perez Dominguez and Weber.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The discovery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and their agonists as primary components that link antiviral innate and adaptive immunity has motivated growing research on STING agonist-mediated immunotherapy and vaccine development. To overcome the delivery challenge in shuttling highly polar STING agonists, typically in the form of cyclic dinucleotides, to target cells and to STING proteins in cellular cytosol, numerous nanoformulation strategies have been implemented for effective STING activation. While many STING-activating nanoparticles are developed to enhance anticancer immunotherapy, their adoption as vaccine adjuvant has vastly propelled antiviral vaccination efforts against challenging public health threats, including HIV, influenza and coronaviruses.

The presentation of the disease is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to critical COVID-19.

In this paper, we hereby review the evidence pertaining to ACE2's relationship to common comorbidities, risk factors, and therapies associated with severe and critical COVID-19. We also highlight gaps of knowledge that require further investigation. The primary comorbidities of respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension had strong evidence.

{"text": "On the Challenges for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Based on a Review of Current Methodologies. Diagnosis of COVID-19 has been challenging owing to the need for mass testing and for combining distinct types of detection to cover the different stages of the infection. In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry. Of special relevance are the methodologies which can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices and the use of artificial intelligence that do not require products from a well-developed biotech industry.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Hypothesis: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a promising treatment option for COVID-19. No definitive treatment for COVID-19 exists although promising results have been reported with remdesivir and glucocorticoids. Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently poses a global public health threat. Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model predicts susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered /deaths) cases and has been widely used but its applicability is limited often to an early phase of epidemic in the case of a large collective population. Full numerical simulation of entire period from beginning till end-point would be helpful in understanding COVID-19 trends with in-patient and infectious at large separately and also in preparing beds and develop quarantine strategies., OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop an isolation considered epidemiological model to simulate a whole trend of the first epidemic in Tokyo and allow to count in-patient and those of infectious at large separately. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equation i.e. effective reproductive number and the final size equation., METHODS: Time-series SARS-COV-2 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo and antibody test conducted by Japan Government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on discrete delay differential equation (ATLM) was introduced. The model can predict trends of in-patient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, in-patient, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model., RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting the present ATLM gave 20% less infectious cases in field than that of standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that time lag T from infected till detected and isolated is 14 days. Based on this, adequate vaccine ratio to avoid outbreak was evaluated 57% of population. The date of release of a statement of emergency was 23rd May was assessed. Taking into consideration of infectious cases in field, 30th May should have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with shorter time lag of T=7 and larger transmission rate alpha=1.43alpha0 suggest that infectious at large should reduce to by half and in-patient be much the same of those of the 1st wave of SARS-COV-2 epidemic while public health intervention is applied to enhance social contact by 43% ., CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-COV-2 data for Tokyo.

BACKGROUND: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America since May 2020, reporting the highest number of cases and deaths in the region. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiencing a significant burden from COVID-19. Identifying and understanding the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with infection are of paramount importance to inform screening strategies and infection control practices in this scenario. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms., METHODS: Between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020 a cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary university hospital in Sao Paulo. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms was determined by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. Participants were asked to complete an electronic structured questionnaire including clinical and demographic data., RESULTS: Overall, 125 (42.37%) of 295 symptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Over the 10-week study period, positivity rates varied from 22.2% (95% CI 15.9-60.3%) in the second week to 55.9% (95% CI 43.2-68.6%) in the sixth week, reaching a plateau (38-46%) thereafter. Median (SD) age was 34.2 (9.9) years and 205 (69.5%) were female. We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the most commonly reported underlying medical condition among healthcare workers that tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable analysis, using logistic regression, anosmia (adjusted OR 4.4 95% CI 2.21-8.74) and ocular pain (adjusted OR 1.95 95% CI 1.14-3.33) were the only symptoms independently associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follow-up information on clinical outcomes showed that 9 (7.2%) HCWs were hospitalized (seven were male) and 2 (1.6%) died., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirmed the high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in the hardest hit city by the pandemic in Latin America. Anosmia and ocular pain were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: In March 2020, as community spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became increasingly prevalent, pregnant women appeared to be equally susceptible to developing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the disease course usually appears mild, severe and critical COVID-19 appears to lead to significant morbidity including ICU admission with prolonged hospital stay, intubation, mechanical ventilation and even death. Although there are recent reports regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, information regarding the severity of COVID-19 in pregnant versus non-pregnant women remains unknown., OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the outcomes of severe and critical COVID-19 infection in pregnant versus non-pregnant reproductive aged women., STUDY DESIGN: This is a multi-center retrospective case-control study of women with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19 in four academic medical centers in NYC and one in Philadelphia between March 12 and May 5, 2020. The cases consist of pregnant women admitted specifically for severe or critical COVID-19 and not for obstetric indication. The controls consist of reproductive aged, non-pregnant women admitted for severe or critical COVID-19. The primary outcome is a composite morbidity including: death, need for intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or need for high flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. Secondary outcomes include ICU admission, length of stay, need for discharge to long term acute care facility and discharge with home oxygen requirement., RESULTS: Thirty-eight pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed infection were admitted to five institutions specifically for COVID-19, 29 (76.3%) meeting criteria for severe disease and 9 (23.7%) meeting criteria for critical disease. The mean age and BMI were significantly higher in the non-pregnant control group. The non-pregnant cohort was also noted to have increased frequency of pre-existing medical comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Pregnant women were more likely to experience the primary outcome when compared to the non-pregnant control group (34.2% vs. 14.9%, p=0.03, adjusted OR 4.6 [95% CI 1.2-18.2]). Pregnant patients experienced higher rates of ICU admission (39.5% vs. 17.0%, p<0.01, adjusted OR 5.2 [95% CI 1.5-17.5]). Among pregnant women that underwent delivery, 72.7% occurred via cesarean delivery and mean gestational age at delivery was 33.8 +/-5.5 weeks in patients with severe disease and 35 +/-3.5 weeks in patients with critical COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with severe and/or critical COVID-19 are at increased risk for certain morbidities when compared to non-pregnant controls. Despite the higher comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension in the non-pregnant controls, the pregnant cases were at increased risk for composite morbidity, intubation, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. These findings suggest that pregnancy may be associated with a worse outcome in women with severe and critical COVID-19. Our study suggests that similar to other viral infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pregnant women may be at risk for greater morbidity and disease severity. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.

{"text": "Exploring the Mechanisms of Influence on COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors in China's Social Media Users. The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed a powerful threat to human life. The preventive behaviors of individuals (e.g., home quarantine, disinfection, and wearing masks) play a key role in preserving and controlling the disease. In this case, as a motivational psychological system oriented toward avoiding infection, the behavioral immune system (BIS) may be activated and link to preventive behaviors. This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgust-purity vice-protection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgust-cognitive processes-preventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels.

We aim to evaluate neurosurgical practice patterns as well as perioperative incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients and their outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective review of neurosurgical and neurointerventional cases at two tertiary centers during the first three months of the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic (March 8-June 8) as well as following three months (post-peak pandemic; June 9-September 9) was performed. Baseline characteristics, perioperative COVID-19 test results, modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients through bivariate and multivariate analysis., RESULTS: 652 neurosurgical and 217 neurointerventional cases were performed during post-peak pandemic period. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, functional/pain, cranioplasty, and cerebral angiogram cases were significantly increased in the post-pandemic period.

In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.

Background: Following the recent epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, a novel betacoronavirus was isolated from two patients in Iran on February 19, 2020. In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (n=127)., Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on all COVID-19-suspected cases, admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital (a designated hospital for COVID-19), Tehran, Iran, since February 19, 2020. All patients were tested for COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Data of confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes, were collected and compared between three groups of patients, requiring different types of admission (requiring ICU admission, admission to the general ward, and transfer to ICU)., Results: Of 412 suspected cases, with the mean age of 54.1 years (SD=13.4), 127 (31%) were positive for COVID-19. Following the patients' first visit to the clinic, 115 cases were admitted to the general ward, while ten patients required ICU admission. Due to clinical deterioration in the condition of 25 patients (out of 115 patients), ICU admission was essential. Based on the results, the baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Patients requiring ICU admission were more likely to have multiorgan involvement (liver involvement, P<0.001; renal involvement, P<0.001; and cardiac involvement, P=0.02), low O2 saturation (P<0.001), and lymphopenia (P=0.05). During hospital admission, 21 (16.5%) patients died, while the rest (83.5%) were discharged and followed-up until March 26, 2020. Also, the survival rate of patients, who received immunoglobulin, was higher than other patients (60.87% vs. 39.13%)., Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was considerable in our study. Based on the present results, this infection can cause multiorgan damage. Therefore, intensive monitoring of these patients needs to be considered.

{"text": "Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin treatment, QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are widely used in off-label treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, cardiac safety of these drugs is still controversial in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate association of HCQ or HCQ+AZM treatment regimens, corrected QT (QTc) interval and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in hospitalized patients., METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. All data were extracted from the electronic medical records. The initial and post-treatment mean QTc intervals were calculated and compared in patients with HCQ alone or HCQ+AZM therapy. Associated factors with QTc prolongation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia during treatment and in-hospital mortality due to ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated., RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age of 49.60+/-18 years, 54.4% men). HCQ+AZM combination therapy group (n=56) was more likely to have comorbidities. After 5-days treatment, 19 (18.8%) patients had QTc prolongation, and significant increase in the QTc interval was observed in both two groups (p<0.001). However, HCQ+AZM combination group had significantly higher DELTAQTc compared to HCQ group (22.5+/-18.4 vs. 7.5+/-15.3 ms, p<0.001). All of 101 patients completed the 5-days treatment without interruption. Also, no malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death secondary to ventricular arrhythmia occurred during the treatment in both groups., CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that although HCQ+AZM treatment was independently associated with QTc prolongation, none of patients experienced malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death during treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the exact implications of these drugs on arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "The Inflammasome in Times of COVID-19. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the genus Betacoronavirus and the Coronaviridiae family responsible for infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and more recently, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CoV infections present mainly as respiratory infections that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, CoVs, such as COVID-19, also present as a hyperactivation of the inflammatory response that results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and its downstream molecule IL-6. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in the activation of caspase-1 that leads to the activation of IL-1beta in a variety of diseases and infections such as CoV infection and in different tissues such as lungs, brain, intestines and kidneys, all of which have been shown to be affected in COVID-19 patients. Here we review the literature regarding the mechanism of inflammasome activation by CoV infection, the role of the inflammasome in ARDS, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) as well as the potential mechanism by which the inflammasome may contribute to the damaging effects of inflammation in the cardiac, renal, digestive, and nervous systems in COVID-19 patients.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 de Rivero Vaccari, Dietrich, Keane and de Rivero Vaccari.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused disruption in all aspects of daily life, including the management and treatment of rare inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). To perform a preliminary assessment of the incidence of COVID-19 in IMD patients and the impact of the coronavirus emergency on the rare metabolic community between March and April 2020, the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Diseases (MetabERN) has performed two surveys: one directed to patients' organizations (PO) and one directed to healthcare providers (HCPs). The COVID-19 incidence in the population of rare metabolic patients was lower than that of the general European population (72.9 x 100,000 vs. 117 x 100,000). However, patients experienced extensive disruption of care, with the majority of appointments and treatments cancelled, reduced, or postponed. Almost all HCPs (90%) were able to substitute face-to-face visits with telemedicine, about half of patients facing treatment changes switched from hospital to home therapy, and a quarter reported difficulties in getting their medicines. During the first weeks of emergency, when patients and families lacked relevant information, most HCPs contacted their patients to provide them with support and information. Since IMD patients require constant follow-up and treatment adjustments to control their disease and avoid degradation of their condition, the results of our surveys are relevant for national health systems in order to ensure appropriate care for IMD patients. They highlight strong links in an interconnected community of HCPs and PO, who are able to work quickly and effectively together to support and protect fragile persons during crisis. However, additional studies are needed to better appreciate the actual impact of COVID-19 on IMD patients' health and the mid- and long-term effects of the pandemic on their wellbeing.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: The COVID-19 Precision Recovery Program (PRP) is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) clinical program that was deployed by a New York health system to perform physiologic and symptomatic monitoring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from the PRP during the COVID-19 crisis in New York. Results: One hundred twelve patients were included; mean (standard deviation) age was 49 (17.6) years and 60.7% were female.

{"text": "Saliva: an important alternative for screening and monitoring of COVID-19 in children. The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide poses challenges to healthcare systems not only in effectively identifying individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, but also in isolating cases to minimise contagion in early diagnosing more severe cases that will need hospitalization. Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence. Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children. Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults. Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces. In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasaki's disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults.

{"text": "Zinc as nutritional intervention and prevention measure for COVID-19 disease. The present spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, provoking COVID-19 disease, progresses rapidly worldwide. In current absence of a curative treatment and an effective, safe vaccine, there is a pressing need to focus on identifying and correcting deficits in immune function in order to reduce risk of severe progress of the disease and to lower the number of infections and fatalities. This paper evaluates the most recent literature on zinc status related to antiviral immunity and its possible role in COVID-19. It is concluded that zinc is a critical factor for antiviral immunity. There is ample evidence suggesting that zinc depletion, also prevalent in high-income nations, compromises immune functions. Notably, major risk groups for COVID-19, the elderly, men more than women, obese individuals and patients with diabetes are all at risk of zinc deficiency. Moreover, various widely used antihypertensive drugs and statin therapy have been reported to negatively influence zinc status. As zinc depletion impairs antiviral immunity, it is hypothesised to increase susceptibility for COVID-19. Therefore, dietary preventive measures and prompt implementation of zinc supplementation for risk groups should be considered. Large-scale studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of micronutrients and antiviral immunity, in particular drug-micronutrient immunity interaction.

During the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) allergic patients need to continue their constant and proper treatment, including allergen-specific immunotherapy. These patients are expected to be at a higher risk for exacerbation of lung inflammation during viral infection. We investigated the putative interplay existing between allergen-specific immunotherapy and COVID-19 infection in a Hymenoptera venom-allergic population. We evaluated the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of 211 subjects referring to our center for the regular administration of venom immunotherapy (VIT). Our result showed that the median age of our cohort is similar to the one that in our region has been associated with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, increased hospitalization, and mortality rates. We reported only an isolated positivity of COVID-19 in the overall group; whereas none suffered from upper airway symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnoea, sore throat, anosmia, and/or ageusia). Even though the demographic characteristics pose a substantial risk for such a population, we suggest that a regular administration of VIT may help in the development of an immunological milieu able to down modulate the Th1/Th17 environment that has been linked to inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the incidence of COVID-19 infection in Hymenoptera venom allergic patients treated with VIT, suggesting indirectly that venom immune tolerance-inducing treatment may be capable of reducing the aberrant inflammatory response induced by the virus in this specific population.

BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are vulnerable to outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential for outbreak response, but is complicated by a high proportion of silent (non-symptomatic) infections and limited testing resources., METHODS: We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in a real LTCF setting. We simulated distribution of nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests using clinical and demographic indications and evaluated the efficacy and resource-efficiency of a range of surveillance strategies, including group testing (sample pooling) and testing cascades, which couple (i) testing for multiple indications (symptoms, admission) with (ii) random daily testing., RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing a silent SARS-CoV-2 infection into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (95% uncertainty interval 6-224) infections after 3 weeks of unmitigated transmission. Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by lags to symptom onset and silent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. Across scenarios, testing upon admission detected just 34-66% of patients infected upon LTCF entry, and also missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was more effective when targeting patients than staff, but was overall an inefficient use of limited resources. At high testing capacity (> 10 tests/100 beds/day), cascades were most effective, with a 19-36% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 26-46% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Conversely, at low capacity (< 2 tests/100 beds/day), group testing strategies detected outbreaks earliest. Pooling randomly selected patients in a daily group test was most likely to detect outbreaks prior to first symptom onset (16-27%), while pooling patients and staff expressing any COVID-like symptoms was the most efficient means to improve surveillance given resource limitations, compared to the reference requiring only 6-9 additional tests and 11-28 additional swabs to detect outbreaks 1-6 days earlier, prior to an additional 11-22 infections., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surveillance is challenged by delayed or absent clinical symptoms and imperfect diagnostic sensitivity of standard RT-PCR tests. In our analysis, group testing was the most effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for resource-limited LTCFs. Testing cascades were even more effective given ample testing resources. Increasing testing capacity and updating surveillance protocols accordingly could facilitate earlier detection of emerging outbreaks, informing a need for urgent intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to develop a severe disease. This study was designed to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients associated with the development of pneumonia and factors associated with disease progression., METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with etiologically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China from December 27, 2019 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed-up to March 16, 2020. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without were determined by the chi2 test or the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and independent group t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). The Cox proportional hazard model and Generalized Estimating Equations were applied to evaluate factors that predicted the progression of COVID-19., RESULTS: The mean incubation was 8.67 (95% confidence interval, 6.78-10.56) days. Mean duration from the first test severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive to conversion was 11.38 (9.86-12.90) days. Compared to pneumonia-free patients, pneumonia patients were 16.5 years older and had higher frequencies of having hypertension, fever, and cough and higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, interleukin-6, low count (< 190/microl) of CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thirteen patients deteriorated during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis indicated that older age and higher serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate at admission significantly predicted the progression of COVID-19. During hospitalization, circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower, whereas neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the circulating levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocyte count in pneumonia patients did not recover when discharged., CONCLUSIONS: Older age and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitionin, interleukin-6, and lactate might predict COVID-19 progression.

Background: Mauritius along with other 12 countries in the African Region was identified at the early start of the COVID-19 pandemic as being at high risk due to high volume of international travel, high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and co-morbidities, high population density and significant share of population over 60 years (16%). The objective of this study was to estimate the total discounted money value of human life losses (TDMVCL MAURITIUS ) associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius. Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) was used to estimate the TDMVCL MAURITIUS of the 10 human life losses linked with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. The HCA model was estimated with the national life expectancy of 75.51 years and a discount rate of 3%. A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming (a) 5 and 10% discount rates, and (b) the average world life expectancy of 73.2 years, and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The money value of human lives lost to COVID-19, at a discounted rate of 3%, had an estimated TDMVCL MAURITIUS of Int$ 3,120,689, and an average of Int$ 312,069 per human life lost. Approximately 74% of the TDMVCL MAURITIUS accrued to persons aged between 20 and 59 years. Reanalysis of the model with 5 and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 19.0 and 45.5%, respectively. Application of the average world life expectancy at 3% discount rate reduced TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 13%; and use of the world highest life expectancy at 3% discount rate increased TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 50%. Conclusions: The average discounted money value per human life loss associated with COVID-19 is 12-fold the per capita GDP for Mauritius. All measures implemented to prevent widespread community transmission of COVID-19 may have saved the country 837 human lives worth Int$258,080,991.

Methods: Data from a single center was analyzed retrospectively. Patients had received preliminary standard of intensive care (SIC) according to a local treatment algorithm, either alone or along with Octagam 5% at 30 g/day for 5 days. Both groups were compared regarding baseline characteristics, survival, and changes in inflammation markers. Imbalance in baseline APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity score matching. Otherwise, Kaplan-Meier and multiple logistic regression models were used. Results: Out of 93 patients, 51 had received Octagam and 42 had not. About 75% of patients were male and both groups had comparable body mass index and AB0 blood type distribution. Octagam-treated patients were younger (mean 65 +/- 15 versus 71 +/- 15 years, p = 0.066) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (APACHE II: 20.6 versus 22.4, p = 0.281; SOFA: 5.0 versus 7.0, p = 0.006). Overall survival was 61% in the SIC + Octagam and 38% in the SIC only group (odds ratio: 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.9-5.4, p = 0.091 after controlling for baseline imbalances). Octagam significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014) and significantly reduced plasma levels of C-reactive protein (median change from baseline -71.5 versus -0.3 mg/L, p = 0.049). Conclusion:  Clinically relevant benefits through adjunct Octagam treatment in COVID-19 need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. Background: Global vaccine development efforts have been accelerated in response to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US). Methods: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 90% against infection following 2 doses administered 28 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population. We specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario and calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.5, accounting for current COVID-19 interventions in the US. Results: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 1.6% (95% CI: 1.3% - 1.8%) from 7.1% (95% CI: 6.3% - 7.9%) across the same period without vaccination. The highest relative reduction (83-90%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 85.2% (95% CI: 82.3% - 87.6%), 85.3% (95% CI: 82.3% - 87.8%), and 87.8% (95% CI: 85.1% - 90.1%), respectively. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on reducing disease transmission and adverse clinical outcomes. However, with uptake of 40% or less in the population, vaccination is unlikely to completely eliminate the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Implications of covid-19 for the management of chronic non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa: Application of the chronic care model. About 41 million people die of chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCDs) each year, accounting for 71% of all global deaths. The high prevalence of CNCDs is particularly problematic for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) since CNCDs are already a major cause of mortality in the subregion. While the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is quite low, it is worth noting that people with underlying CNCDs constitute the majority of those who die from this virus. Underpinned by the chronic care model (CCM), we present a commentary on the implications of COVID-19 for the management of CNCDs in SSA. We realized that despite the World Health Organisation's guidelines for countries to maintain essential services while putting necessary measures in place to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19, myriad of health systems and community-level factors militate against effective management of the CNCDs in SSA. This results in disruptions in management of the conditions as well as possible long-term effects such as the deterioration of the health status of CNCD patients and even deaths. Without immediate interventions to salvage the status quo, SSA countries may not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 target of reducing by one-third, premature mortality from CNCDs by the year 2030. We recommend that financial constraints could be ameliorated through short- and long-term loan facilities from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to augment national efforts at strengthening health systems while combating COVID-19. We also recommend increased community engagement and public education by COVID-19 response teams to enhance community support for persons living with CNCDs and to reduce social stigmatization.Copyright \u00a9 Hubert Amu et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. However, the prevalence of retesting positive by RT-PCR for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated patient characteristics, remain unclear., Methods: We included 90 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated in the Nanjing Public Health Center from January 20, 2020 to February 16, 2020 in this retrospective study. All patients completed treatment for COVID-19 and were retested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 4-20 days after completion of therapy. The clinical characteristics between patients with who retested positive versus negative by RT-PCR were compared, and the factors predictive of positive retesting were analyzed. Positive retesting was modeled with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)., Results: The age range of the study population was 0.8-97 years, and all patients were cured or showed improvement. A total of 10 (11%) patients retested positive by RT-PCR 4-20 days after completion of therapy. As compared with patients who retested negative, those who retested positive had a lower percentage of pre-admission fever, a higher percentage of post-admission fever, a lower percentage of bilateral lung infection, higher white blood cell (WBC) count and creatine phosphokinase, and lower hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis of the above eight key variables showed that lower hs-CRP and higher WBC were independently associated with positive retesting by RT-PCR. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC were predictive of positive retesting, with an AUC of 0.859., Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 who retested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 had mild symptoms and better blood testing results. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC may predict positive retesting by RT-PCR; however, the sensitivity and specificity should be studied further. Copyright 2020 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

{"text": "COVID-19 challenges to dentistry in the new pandemic epicenter: Brazil. A nationwide survey of dentists was carried out in Brazil, a new pandemic epicenter, to analyze how dental care coverage has been affected in public versus private networks, changes in routine and burdens, and how local prevalence of COVID-19 affects dental professionals. Dentists were recruited via email and Instagram R. Responses to a pre-tested questionnaire were collected May 15-24, 2020. COVID-19 case/death counts in the state where respondents work was used to test associations between contextual status and decreases in weekly appointments, fear of contracting COVID-19 at work, and current work status (alpha = 0.05). Over 10 days, 3,122 responses were received (response rate ~2.1%) from all Brazilian states. Work status was affected for 94%, with less developed regions being more impacted. The pandemic impact on clinical routine was high/very high for 84%, leading to varied changes to clinic infrastructure, personal protective equipment use, and patient screening, as well as increased costs. COVID-19 patients had been seen by 5.3% of respondents; 90% reported fearing contracting COVID-19 at work. Multilevel models showed that greater case and death rates (counted as 1000 cases and 100 deaths per million inhabitants) in one's state increased the odds of being fearful of contracting the disease (18% and 25%). For each additional 1000 cases/100 deaths, the odds of currently not working or treating only emergencies increased by 36% and 58%. The reduction in patients seen weekly was significantly greater in public (38.7+/-18.6) than in private clinics (22.5+/-17.8). This study provides early evidence of three major impacts of the pandemic on dentistry: increasing inequalities due to coverage differences between public and private networks; the adoption of new clinical routines, which are associated with an economic burden for dentists; and associations of regional COVID-19 incidence/mortality with fear of contracting the disease at work.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. To date, there are limited studies that have investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among female population. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) and it's related factors among women in Guangzhou, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 30th March 2020 to 13th April 2020 using anonymous online questionnaire among 864 women at 6-12 weeks postpartum. The Chinese version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and a questionnaire regarding associated factors were administered to all participants. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors that were significantly associated with PPD., RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD among women at 6-12 weeks postpartum was 30.0%. A multivariate logistic regression model identified significant factors as: immigrant women, persistent fever, poor social support, concerns about contracting COVID-19 and certain precautionary measures., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need for policies and interventions to not only mitigate the psychological impacts but also target disadvantaged sub-groups of women following childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Immunity and coagulation and fibrinolytic processes may reduce the risk of severe illness in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. Background: There are specific physiological features regarding the immunity and coagulation among pregnant women, which may play important roles in the development of coronavirus disease 2019. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the key factors associated with the deterioration of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and the differentiating clinical characteristics of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 to interfere with the progression of coronavirus disease 2019. Study Design: A retrospective study of 539 Chinese Han adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was conducted, of which 36 cases were pregnant women. In addition, 36 pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019 were recruited as the control. The characteristics of severe and critical illnesses, which were differentiated from mild and moderate illnesses in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. In addition, major differences between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and age-matched nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, paired with pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019, were explored to identify specific physiological features of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. Result(s): For the total patient population, the lymphocyte, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts were significantly lower, and white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were higher in those with severe or critical illness than those with mild or moderate illness (P<.001). The plasma levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio were significantly increased in patients with critical illness compared with patients with mild, moderate, and severe illnesses (P<.001). The above immunologic coclusters achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.801 (95% confidence interval, 0.764-0.838), and its combined model with the coagulation and fibrinolysis indices (prothrombin time, D-dimer) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.815 (95% confidence interval, 0.779-0.851) using the random forest regression model to predict severe or critical illness. For pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, none had preexisting diseases. Compared with nonpregnant women with mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 displayed increased white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, along with decreased lymphocyte and interleukin-4 levels (P<.05). Although they presented similar changes of immunologic markers of lymphocyte; white blood cell count; neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts; and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio, compared with nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, none of the pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 deteriorated into severe or critical illness. There was no significant difference in white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, immunologic markers, or coagulation and fibrinolysis markers between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019. As for the discrepancy of pathophysiological features between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the immunologic markers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.977), and its combined model with coagulation and fibrinolysis indices achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.931 (95% confidence interval, 0.850-1.000). Conclusion(s): Immune dysregulation was identified as a crucial feature of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, which developed severe or critical illness, and pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 presented with similar immune responses but rarer incidences of severe or critical illness. Immune dysregulation is related to the risks of deterioration into severe or critical illness.

Background: Cross-sectional observational studies have reported obesity and cardiometabolic co-morbidities as important predictors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. The causal impact of these risk factors is unknown at present., Methods: We conducted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the observational associations between obesity traits (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC]), quantitative cardiometabolic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], serum glucose, serum glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides [TG]) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the UK Biobank cohort. One-sample MR was performed by using the genetic risk scores of obesity and cardiometabolic traits constructed from independent datasets and the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank. Two-sample MR was performed using the summary statistics from COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the risk conferred by different genetic quintiles of causative exposure traits., Results: The study comprised 1,211 European participants who were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 387,079 participants who were either untested or tested negative between 16 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. Observationally, higher BMI, WC, HbA1c and lower HDL-cholesterol were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. One-sample MR analyses found causal associations between higher genetically determined BMI and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.15, confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.26 and OR: 1.58, CI: 1.21-2.06, per 1 standard deviation increment in BMI and LDL cholesterol respectively). Two-sample MR produced concordant results. Cox models indicated that individuals in the higher genetic risk score quintiles of BMI and LDL were more predisposed to COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, CI: 1.03-1.49 and HR: 1.37, CI: 1.14-1.65, for the top vs the bottom quintile for BMI and LDL cholesterol, respectively)., Conclusion: We identified causal associations between BMI, LDL cholesterol and susceptibility to COVID-19. In particular, individuals in higher genetic risk categories were predisposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support the integration of BMI into the risk assessment of COVID-19 and allude to a potential role of lipid modification in the prevention and treatment.

{"text": "Sequential Data Assimilation of the Stochastic SEIR Epidemic Model for Regional COVID-19 Dynamics. Newly emerging pandemics like COVID-19 call for predictive models to implement precisely tuned responses to limit their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with relatively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: To summarize and evaluate current reports on community-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in young infants. Study design: We performed a systematic review to identify reports published from November 1, 2019, until June 15, 2020, on laboratory-confirmed community-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants younger than 3 months of age. We excluded studies reporting neonates with perinatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure and diagnosis before hospital discharge and hospital-onset disease, as well as clinically diagnosed cases without confirmation. Two independent reviewers performed study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Variables of interest included patient age, exposure to COVID-19, medical history, clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, laboratory findings, clinical course, and disposition. Result(s): In total, 38 publications met inclusion criteria, including 23 single case reports, 14 case series, and 1 cohort study, describing 63 infants younger than 3 months of age with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most cases were mild to moderate. Fever, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and neurologic findings were reported. Laboratory abnormalities included neutropenia, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers and aminotransferases. Fifty-eight (92%) infants were hospitalized, 13 (21%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 2 (3%) required mechanical ventilation. No death was reported. Conclusion(s): Among young infants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, most cases were mild to moderate and improved with supportive care.

{"text": "Comparison of Infection Risks and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 Lung Infection under Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System Blockade - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. AIM: ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Animal studies suggest that RAAS blockers might increase the expression of ACE2 and potentially increase the risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of ACE inhibitor (ACEi) treatment on the pneumonia incidence in non-COVID-19 patients (25 studies, 330,780 patients) was associated with a 26% reduction of pneumonia risk (OR: 0.74, p<0.001). Pneumonia related death cases in ACEi treated non-COVID-19 patients were reduced by 27% (OR: 0.73, p=0.004). However, ARB treatment (10 studies, 275,621 non-COVID-19 patients) did not alter pneumonia risk in patients. Pneumonia related death cases in ARBs treated non-COVID-19 patients was analysed only in one study and was significantly reduced (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.72). Results from 11 studies (8.4 million patients) showed that the risk of getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was reduced by 13% (OR: 0.87, p=0.014) in patients treated with ACEi, whereas analysis from 10 studies (8.4 million patients) treated with ARBs showed no effect (OR, 0.92, p=0.354). Results from 34 studies in 67,644 COVID-19 patients showed that RAAS blockade reduces all-cause mortality by 24% (OR=0.76, p=0.04). CONCLUSION(S): ACEi reduces the risk of getting infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Blocking the RAAS may decrease all cause mortality in COVID-19 patients. ACE inhibitors do reduce the risk of non-COVID pneumonia. All cause mortality due to non-COVID pneumonia is reduced by ACEi and potentially by ARBs.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widespread since late December 2019, with several symptoms related to the upper and lower respiratory system. However, its cardiac manifestations are less frequently studied. We aimed to analyze the available COVID-19 data on acute cardiac injury, using troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels., METHODS: We performed a systematic review on Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases until March 25, 2020. Relevant records reporting the incidence of acute cardiac injury as well as troponin and BNP levels were collected from published peer-reviewed articles with further analysis according to the clinical status of the patients (severe, non-severe, and death)., RESULTS: Eleven records of 1394 individuals were included. The mean age of patients with acute cardiac injury was 56.6 +/- 33.4 years (males: 54.3%). The incidence of acute cardiac injury was 15% (95% CI: 11, 20%). Further analysis revealed that dead or severe patients had significantly higher percentages of myocardial injury, compared to non-severe ones (peer-reviewed: 44%, 95% CI: 16, 74% vs. 24%, 95% CI: 15, 34% vs. 5%, 95% CI: 1, 12%, respectively). Mean total troponin was 10.23 pg/mL (95% CI: 5.98, 14.47), while 13% (95% CI: 8%, 18%) of patients had elevated levels. Mean BNP was 216.74 pg/mL (95% CI: 3.27, 430.20)., CONCLUSION: Acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is more frequent than what was expected at the beginning of the outbreak. Meanwhile, further studies are needed to investigate the utility of cardiac biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for long-term cardiac complications of this infection.

The aim of this multicentre study is to gain a greater understanding of the impact lockdown has had on the rates, mechanisms and types of injuries together with their management across a regional trauma service., Methods: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019., Results: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019. The number of patients with fragility fractures requiring admission remained constant (32 patients in 2019 vs 31 patients during lockdown; p > 0.05).

BACKGROUND: The viral load and tissue distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain important questions. The current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)., METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Most patients (91%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with a 30-day mortality of 30%. None of the patients received antiviral treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100% of the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77%. Blood samples were positive in 26% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p = 0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day survival or disease severity.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular mortality and catherization activity during the lockdown in central Germany: an observational study. AIMS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital admissions for cardiac care have declined. However, effects on mortality are unclear. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period in central Germany on overall and cardiovascular deaths. Simultaneously we looked at catheterization activities in the same region., METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 22 of 24 public health-authorities in central Germany were aggregated during the pandemic related lockdown period and compared to the same time period in 2019. Information on the total number of deaths and causes of death, including cardiovascular mortality, were collected. Additionally, we compared rates of hospitalization (n = 5178) for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 26 hospitals in this area. Data on 5,984 deaths occurring between March 23, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated. In comparison to the reference non-pandemic period in 2019 (deaths: n = 5832), there was a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality of 2.6% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.06; p = 0.16]. Cardiovascular and cardiac mortality increased significantly by 7.6% (IRR 1.08, 95%-CI 1.01-1.14; p = 0.02) and by 11.8% (IRR 1.12, 95%-CI 1.05-1.19; p < 0.001), respectively. During the same period, our data revealed a drop in cardiac catherization procedures., CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19-related lockdown a significant increase in cardiovascular mortality was observed in central Germany, whereas catherization activities were reduced. The mechanisms underlying both of these observations should be investigated further in order to better understand the effects of a pandemic-related lockdown and social-distancing restrictions on cardiovascular care and mortality.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: Measures to control the on-going Covid-19 pandemic such as quarantine and social distancing, together with information overload about the sporadic spread of the disease have negatively impacted many individuals' mental and psychosocial health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of self-reported mental health parameters and the coping mechanisms of employees and students in a Saudi State University., Methods: An online survey in both Arabic and English was launched targeting students, staff and faculty of King Saud University from May 11 to June 6, 2020, the peak of Saudi Arabia's nationwide lockdown. A total of 1542 respondents (726 males and 816 females) aged 20-65 years old participated., Results: Majority of the respondents claimed to have suffered from anxiety (58.1%), depression (50.2%) and insomnia (32.2%) during the lockdown. On average, 65.3% respondents agreed that family bond strengthened during lockdown. Those in the highest quartile of family bonding score (Q4) were 41% [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.59 (0.39-0.87), p<0.001] and 59% [OR 0.41 (CI 0.27-0.64), p<0.001] were less likely to be anxious and depressed, respectively, even after adjusting for covariates.

Humoral immune responses are typically characterized by primary IgM antibody responses followed by secondary antibody responses associated with immune memory and comprised of of IgG, IgA and IgE. Here we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in the serum, saliva and broncho-alveolar fluid of 159 patients with COVID-19. Early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were dominated by IgA antibodies. Peripheral expansion of IgA plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. The virus-specific antibody responses included IgG, IgM and IgA, but IgA contributed to virus neutralization to a greater extent compared with IgG. Specific IgA serum concentrations decreased notably one month after the onset of symptoms, but neutralizing IgA remained detectable in saliva for a longer time (days 49 to 73 post symptoms). These results represent a critical observation given the emerging information as to the types of antibodies associated with optimal protection against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider targeting a potent but potentially short-lived IgA response.

{"text": "Coronavirus: COVID-19 transmission in pacific small island developing states. Background: Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have health care systems with a limited capacity to deal with pandemics, making them especially vulnerable to the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper examines the introduction, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19 into Pacific SIDS. Method(s): Calculate the rate of transmission (the average number of new cases per day between the first recorded case and the most recent day) and connectivity (daily direct flights to the leading airport in each selected island group) using flight history and COVID-19 transmission data. Result(s): Correlational analyses show that connectivity is positively related with (a) first-case dates and (b) spread rate in Pacific SIDS. Conclusion(s): Connectivity plays a central role in the spread of COVID-19 in Pacific SIDS. The continued entry of people was a significant factor for spread within countries. Efforts to prevent transmission by closing borders reduced transmission but also created significant economic hardship because many Pacific SIDS rely heavily on tourism and international exchange. The findings highlight the importance of exploring the possibility that the COVID-19 spread rate may be higher than official figures indicate, and present pathways to mitigate socio-economic impacts. The practical implications of the findings reveal the vulnerability of Pacific SIDS to pandemics and the key role of connectivity in the spread of COVID-19 in the Pacific region.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) seem to be at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 infection and associated complications due to their immunocompromised state, the older age and comorbidities. The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted. The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Repositivity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in discharged COVID-19 patients was reported recently. However, the characteristics of repositive results are still not well understood, leading to a lack of effective monitoring strategies., METHODS: In the present study, a total of 59 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and the characteristics of the repositive samples were analyzed., RESULTS: The repositive rate in this cohort was 15.79%. The N gene was the main target gene that was positive in the repositive results as well as in the last positive results of all patients. The median duration from diagnosis to the last positive test was 20 days (IQR, 16-31 days), and the longest duration was 40 days. Repositivity was only observed in IgM single- or both IgM- and IgG-positive patients, instead of IgG single-positive patients., CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant proportion of repositives in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and increasing the required number of negatives for consecutive nucleic acid tests may reduce the incidence of repositives. The recommended monitoring strategy for repositivity is monitoring the N gene in IgM-positive patients. This can ensure high sensitivity while reducing the time and cost of nucleic acid detection.

BACKGROUND: Early detection, isolation and management of COVID-19 are crucial to contain the current pandemic. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020.

{"text": "Transmission of SARS-COV-2 Infections in Households - Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020. Improved understanding of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), within households could aid control measures. However, few studies have systematically characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. households (1). Previously reported transmission rates vary widely, and data on transmission rates from children are limited. To assess household transmission, a case-ascertained study was conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, and Marshfield, Wisconsin, commencing in April 2020. In this study, index patients were defined as the first household members with COVID-19-compatible symptoms who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, and who lived with at least one other household member. After enrollment, index patients and household members were trained remotely by study staff members to complete symptom diaries and obtain self-collected specimens, nasal swabs only or nasal swabs and saliva samples, daily for 14 days. For this analysis, specimens from the first 7 days were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using CDC RT-PCR protocols.  A total of 191 enrolled household contacts of 101 index patients reported having no symptoms on the day of the associated index patient's illness onset, and among these 191 contacts, 102 had SARS-CoV-2 detected in either nasal or saliva specimens during follow-up, for a secondary infection rate of 53% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-60%). Among fourteen households in which the index patient was aged <18 years, the secondary infection rate from index patients aged <12 years was 53% (95% CI = 31%-74%) and from index patients aged 12-17 years was 38% (95% CI = 23%-56%). Approximately 75% of secondary infections were identified within 5 days of the index patient's illness onset, and substantial transmission occurred whether the index patient was an adult or a child. Because household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common and can occur rapidly after the index patient's illness onset, persons should self-isolate immediately at the onset of COVID-like symptoms, at the time of testing as a result of a high risk exposure, or at the time of a positive test result, whichever comes first. Concurrent to isolation, all members of the household should wear a mask when in shared spaces in the household..", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Winter is coming: A southern hemisphere perspective of the environmental drivers of sars-cov-2 and the potential seasonality of covid-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in humans were first reported in December 2019, the boreal winter. The resulting COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO in March 2020. By July 2020, COVID-19 was present in 213 countries and territories, with over 12 million confirmed cases and over half a million attributed deaths. Knowledge of other viral respiratory diseases suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could be modulated by seasonally varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Many studies on the environmental sensitivity of COVID-19 are appearing online, and some have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Initially, these studies raised the hypothesis that climatic conditions would subdue the viral transmission rate in places entering the boreal summer, and that southern hemisphere countries would experience enhanced disease spread. For the latter, the COVID-19 peak would coincide with the peak of the influenza season, increasing misdiagnosis and placing an additional burden on health systems. In this review, we assess the evidence that environmental drivers are a significant factor in the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, globally and regionally. We critically assessed 42 peer-reviewed and 80 preprint publications that met qualifying criteria. Since the disease has been prevalent for only half a year in the northern, and one-quarter of a year in the southern hemisphere, datasets capturing a full seasonal cycle in one locality are not yet available. Analyses based on space-for-time substitutions, i.e., using data from climatically distinct locations as a surrogate for seasonal progression, have been inconclusive. The reported studies present a strong northern bias. Socio-economic conditions peculiar to the 'Global South' have been omitted as confounding variables, thereby weakening evidence of environmental signals. We explore why research to date has failed to show convincing evidence for environmental modulation of COVID-19, and discuss directions for future research. We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests a weak modulation effect, currently overwhelmed by the scale and rate of the spread of COVID-19. Seasonally modulated transmission, if it exists, will be more evident in 2021 and subsequent years.Copyright \u00a9 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Epigenetic Regulator miRNA Pattern Differences Among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 World-Wide Isolates Delineated the Mystery Behind the Epic Pathogenicity and Distinct Clinical Characteristics of Pandemic COVID-19. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is still elusive, and there is a need to address its deadly nature and to design effective therapeutics. Here, we present a study that elucidates the interplay between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses' and host's miRNAs, an epigenetic regulator, as a mode of pathogenesis; and we explored how the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections differ in terms of their miRNA-mediated interactions with the host and the implications this has in terms of disease complexity. We have utilized computational approaches to predict potential host and viral miRNAs and their possible roles in different important functional pathways. We have identified several putative host antiviral miRNAs that can target the SARS viruses and also predicted SARS viruses-encoded miRNAs targeting host genes. In silico predicted targets were also integrated with SARS-infected human cell microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data. A comparison between the host miRNA binding profiles on 67 different SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 24 different countries with respective country's normalized death count surprisingly uncovered some miRNA clusters, which are associated with increased death rates. We have found that induced cellular miRNAs can be both a boon and a bane to the host immunity, as they have possible roles in neutralizing the viral threat; conversely, they can also function as proviral factors. On the other hand, from over representation analysis, our study revealed that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral miRNAs could target broad immune-signaling pathways; only some of the SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are found to uniquely target some immune-signaling pathways, such as autophagy, IFN-I signaling, etc., which might suggest their immune-escape mechanisms for prolonged latency inside some hosts without any symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate several important cellular pathways that might lead to the increased anomalies in patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, breathing complications, etc. This might suggest that miRNAs can be a key epigenetic modulator behind the overcomplications amongst the COVID-19 patients. Our results support that miRNAs of host and SARS-CoV-2 can indeed play a role in the pathogenesis which can be further concluded with more experiments. These results will also be useful in designing RNA therapeutics to alleviate the complications from COVID-19.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Khan, Sany, Islam and Islam.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Study volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by means of quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay of nares swab specimens obtained between the time of arrival and the second day of supervised quarantine and on days 7 and 14. Recruits who did not volunteer for the study underwent qPCR testing only on day 14, at the end of the quarantine period. We performed phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes obtained from infected study volunteers to identify clusters and to assess the epidemiologic features of infections., RESULTS: A total of 1848 recruits volunteered to participate in the study; within 2 days after arrival on campus, 16 (0.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 15 of whom were asymptomatic. An additional 35 participants (1.9%) tested positive on day 7 or on day 14. Five of the 51 participants (9.8%) who tested positive at any time had symptoms in the week before a positive qPCR test. Of the recruits who declined to participate in the study, 26 (1.7%) of the 1554 recruits with available qPCR results tested positive on day 14. No SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through clinical qPCR testing performed as a result of daily symptom monitoring. Analysis of 36 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from 32 participants revealed six transmission clusters among 18 participants. Epidemiologic analysis supported multiple local transmission events, including transmission between roommates and among recruits within the same platoon., CONCLUSIONS: Among Marine Corps recruits, approximately 2% who had previously had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of supervised quarantine, and less than 2% of recruits with unknown previous status, tested positive by day 14. Most recruits who tested positive were asymptomatic, and no infections were detected through daily symptom monitoring. Transmission clusters occurred within platoons.

The 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic with a worldwide death toll of over 416,000 as of June 10, 2020. Although the first documented cases in Wuhan, China were patients with severe respiratory symptoms including cough, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, the disease process can also be asymptomatic. In this case report, an asymptomatic 63-year-old male with Lynch syndrome undergoing a routine staging fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography was found to have typical radiologic features of COVID-19 with marked pulmonary FDG uptake and was subsequently diagnosed via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Many studies have described the appearance of COVID-19 on chest radiography and CT with the most common imaging features being bilateral, peripheral, and basilar predominant ground glass opacities and consolidation. Although these findings are typically nonspecific for an atypical lung infection, early recognition of COVID-19 in the setting of a global pandemic (even in the asymptomatic patient) is critical in order to limit the spread of disease.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Psychological health among healthcare workers (HCWs) has become a major concern since the COVID-19 outbreak. HCWs perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, in relation to depression were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceived high risk of contracting COVID-19 (close contact with cases, inadequate provision of personal protective equipment, insufficient infection control training, and presence of symptoms) would be significant predictors of depression. Our cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively. The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks. HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression. Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Lam, Arora, Grey, Suen, Huang, Li and Lam.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Prolonged QTc interval and life-threatening arrhythmias (LTA) are potential drug induced complications previously reported with antimalarial, antivirals and antibiotics., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate prevalence and predictors of QTc interval prolongation and incidence of LTA during hospitalization for COVID-19 among patients with normal admission QTc., METHODS: 110 consecutive patients were enrolled in a multicenter international registry. 12-lead ECG was performed at admission, after 7 and 14 days; QTc values were analyzed., RESULTS: Fifteen (14%) patients developed a prolonged-QTc (pQT) after 7 days (mean QTc increase 66+/-20msec, +16%, p<0.001); these patients were older, had higher basal heart rates, higher rates of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, lower platelet count. QTc increase was inversely proportional to baseline QTc levels and leukocyte count and directly to basal heart rates(p<0.01). At multivariate stepwise analysis including age, male gender, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, basal QTc values, basal heart rate and dual antiviral therapy, age(OR 1.06, 95% C.I. 1.00-1.13, p<0.05), basal heart rate(OR 1.07, 95% C.I. 1.02-1.13, p<0.01) and dual antiviral therapy(OR 12.46, 95% C.I. 2.09-74.20, p<0.1) were independent predictors of QT-prolongation. Incidence of LTA during hospitalization was 3.6%. One patient experienced cardiac arrest and three non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. LTAs were recorded after a median of 9 days from hospitalization and were associated with 50% of mortality rate., CONCLUSIONS: After 7 days of hospitalization, 14% of patients with Covid-19 developed pQTc; age, basal heart rate and dual antiviral therapy were found as independent predictor of pQTc.

BACKGROUND: The factors predicting the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from mild to moderate to critical are unclear. We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for disease progression in Japanese COVID-19 patients., METHOD: Seventy-four patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were hospitalized in our hospital between February 20, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We excluded asymptomatic, non-Japanese, and pediatric patients. We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and identified risk factors by univariate regression., RESULTS: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1% male). The median time from symptom onset to admission was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2%), two (3.5%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (COV: 309 U/l), a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980/mul), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression. However, in the Cox proportional hazards analysis, lymphocytopenia at admission was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: We identified three candidate risk factors for progression to critical COVID-19 in adult Japanese patients: statin use, elevated LDH level, and decreased eGFR.

After the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the disease quickly become a pandemic that has seriously affected the economic and health systems in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Although most patients have mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic, there are patients who can develop serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or venous thromboembolism requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Hence, it is important to identify patients with a higher risk of complications in a timely manner. Thus, the objective of this paper is to review the hematological laboratory parameters that consistently are altered in COVID-19 and to identify their relationship with the severity of the disease. According to 11 selected reports, the frequency of patients aged > 65 years is higher among subjects severely affected or deceased; likewise, males predominantly suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or obesity. Retrospective studies have identified alterations in various hematological and inflammatory parameters as part of the host's response to infection and a secondary increased risk of different thrombotic events. Among these altered parameters, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 have been tested as prognostic biomarkers due to their close relationship with the severity of the disease. Actually, they can reliably indicate the use of antithrombotic therapy at prophylactic or therapeutic doses (mainly D-dimer), as has already been established in those patients who, after an individualized assessment, appear to be at high risk for thrombotic events.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has led to a global pandemic in which case fatality rate (CFR) has varied from country to country. This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion:  Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

COVID-19 is a viral pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus. The mechanisms of innate immunity, considered as the first line of antiviral defense, is essential towards viruses. A significant role in host defense of the lung, nasal and oral cavities is played by Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) HE4 has been demonstrated to be serum inflammatory biomarker and to show a role in natural immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract with both antimicrobial/antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Several biomarkers like IL-6, presepsin (PSP), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, D-Dimer have showed a good function as predictor factors for the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients (mild, severe and critical). The aim of this study was to correlate the blood levels of CRP, IL-6, PSP, PCT, D-Dimer with He4, to identify the predictive values of these biomarkers for the evolution of the disease and to evaluate the possible role of HE4 in the defense mechanisms of innate immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of Policlinico-University of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6 +/- 12.4 and 28 women age 65.7 +/- 15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4 +/- 7.7 and 6 women age 74.8 +/- 6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (r = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (r = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (r = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (r = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (r = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Mysterious Virus: A Review on Behavior and Treatment Approaches of the Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. At the end of the year 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was spreading in Wuhan, China, and the outbreak process has a high speed. It was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Coronaviruses are enveloped and single-stranded RNA that have several families including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The pathogenesis mechanism and disease outcomes of SARS and MERS are now clear to some extent, but little information is available for 2019-nCoV. This newly identified corona virus infection represents flu-like symptoms, but usually the first symptoms are fever and dry cough. There has been no specific treatment against 2019-nCoV up to now, and physicians only apply supportive therapy.

{"text": "HIGH INCIDENCE OF SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2. SESSION TITLE: Disorders of the Pleura Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Spontaneous pneumothorax is a relatively common complication in critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Limited data exists regarding pneumothorax in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. This study depicts cases of spontaneous pneumothorax in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients and explores the potential underlying mechanisms. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 patients with severe ARDS admitted to a tertiary care center between March 9, 2020 to April 5, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction. Only patients on mechanical ventilation were analyzed. RESULT(S): A total of 22 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on mechanical ventilation were identified and analyzed. Out of these, 7 patients developed a spontaneous pneumothorax. The patients were predominantly male (86%) with an age range between 67 and 82 years old. Cough (100%) and shortness of breath (71%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not present in any of the patients. Pneumothoraxes were diagnosed 6 to 33 days after hospital admission. All 7 patients had subclavian central lines that were placed by 4 different providers with more than 15 years of critical care experience. All 7 patients had right sided pneumothoraxes of varying sizes but only 42% had right-sided lines. Remarkably, the mean peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) for these patients was 25 cm H2O and the mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 11 cm H2O. Prone positioning was utilized in 57% of patients and 42% of patients received convalescent plasma. The mortality rate was 71% and the 2 patients who survived were discharged to long term acute care hospitals. CONCLUSION(S): Traditionally, ventilator associated pneumothorax is associated with a Ppeak greater than 40 cm H2O, which contrasts with the mean Ppeak of 25 cm H2O observed in this study. While iatrogenic pneumothoraces are common following subclavian central line placement, the majority of the pneumothoraces in this study occurred on the opposite side of the procedure. ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to have a completely different pathophysiology than that of traditional ARDS, which is typically managed with low PEEP and Ppeak. Utilizing the ARDSnet protocol in patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 may be deleterious. Further investigation is needed to evaluate this hypothesis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be distinct from ARDS caused by other disease processes and may have a different risk of pneumothorax development. As elderly, critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with ARDS have been found to have increased risk of death, identifying modifiable risks associated with the development of a spontaneous pneumothorax could help mitigate morbidity and mortality in this population.

Subsequently, an official name was given as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) study group. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the Coronavirus disease-2019 as COVID-19. The epidemics of COVID-2019 have been recorded over 113 countries/territories/areas apart from China and filched more than 4,292 humans, affecting severely around 1,18,326 cases in a short span. The status of COVID-2019 emergency revised by the WHO within 42 days from Public Health International Emergency (January 30, 2020) to a pandemic (March 11, 2020). Nonetheless, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the current epidemic is on the rise (between 2-4%), relatively is lower than the previous SARS-CoV (2002/2003) and MERS-CoV (2012) outbreaks. Even though investigations are on its way, the researchers across the globe have assumptions of animal-origin of current SARS-CoV-2. A recent case report provides evidence of mild COVID-2019 infection in a pet dog that acquired COVID-2019 infection from his owner in Hong Kong. The news on travellers associated spread across the globe have also put many countries on alert with the cancellation of tourist visa to all affected countries and postponement of events where international visits were required. A few diagnostic approaches, including quantitative and differential real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, have been recommended for the screening of the individuals at risk.

Testing efforts for SARS-CoV-2 have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS were compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordance for saliva and NPS was 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS was 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva detected 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. In symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA: 82.4% vs 85.3%). The overall PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva detecting 4 cases less than NPS. However, saliva performance in symptomatic adults was identical to NPS (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate alternative sample choice to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults., Summary: Saliva is an acceptable alternative specimen compared to nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

{"text": "Challenges for a Cancer Center in the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Epidemic. INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is sweeping through China, posing the greatest ever threat to its public health and economy. As a tertiary cancer center in Southwest China, we formulated and implemented an anti-infection protocol to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 in our department. METHOD(S): The anti-infection protocol divided patients into 3 categories, namely outpatients, inpatients, and patients receiving radiation therapy at our cancer center, and each category had a distinct anti-infection protocol to minimize the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 transmission. In each category, the patients were classified into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. Each risk group was managed differently. A survey of patient volume changes prior to and during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak was performed. RESULT(S): We carried out the anti-infection protocol at our cancer center during the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. We found that the total volume of both outpatient visits and inpatient treatment declined significantly depending on the conditions of each group. Radiation therapy and palliative service had the lowest and highest volume reductions at 58.3% and 100%, respectively. The decline in outpatient volumes was higher than the decline in inpatient treatment services (78.8% vs 71.8%). There was no Coronavirus disease 2019 cross-infection at our center, or Coronavirus disease 2019-related injury or death. The anti-infection protocol measures continue to be taken at the hospital even today but they have been modified depending on the prevalent local conditions. CONCLUSION(S): Challenges from the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic remain in our community. The anti-infection protocol implemented at our cancer center has been effective in preventing cross-infection. Whether our anti-infection protocol experience can be applied to curb the spread of the infection in other parts of the world remains to be tested.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Mait cells in covid-19: Heroes, villains, or both?. Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) are unconventional, innate-like T lymphocytes with remarkable effector and immunoregulatory functions. They are abundant in the human peripheral blood and also enriched in mucosal layers and in the lungs, SARS-CoV-2's main ports of entry. Once activated, MAIT cells produce inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic effector molecules quickly and copiously. MAIT cells are best known for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, they are also activated during viral infections, typically in a cytokine-dependent manner, which may promote antiviral immunity. On the other hand, it is plausible to assume active roles for MAIT cells in infec-tion-provoked cytokine storms and tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, mild, severe, or even fatal, depending on sex, age, the presence of preexisting morbidities, and the individual's immunological competence, or lack thereof, among other factors. Based on the available literature, I propose that MAIT cells regulate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and constitute attractive targets in the prevention or clinical management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and some of its complications. Unlike mainstream T cells, MAIT cells are restricted by a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule called MHC-related protein 1 (MR1).

Background and aims: COVID-19 is likely to affect the lives of individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity and glycemic control in such individuals is not known. We studied the physical activity and glycemic control during lockdown in comparison to pre-lockdown parameters in individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes. Method(s): This prospective, observational study includes 2240 people with T2DM regularly attending diabetes clinic prior to lockdown. Glycemic record, HbA1c, and physical activity assessed with Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) as metabolic equivalents (MetS min/week) were obtained during lockdown (minimum duration of 3 months). Result(s): A total of 422 out of 750 participants (nest) responded. The median (IQR) for age was 58 (52 to 64) years, duration of diabetes 11 (6 to 16) years, prevalent foot complications in 59.7%, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 21.3% of participants. There was a decrease in HbA1c from 7.8% (6.9 to 9.4) prior lockdown to 7.4% (6.6 to8.7) during lockdown [DELTAHbA1c - 0.41 +/- 0.27% (p = 0.005)] and postprandial blood glucose 200.0 mg/dl (152.0 to 252.0) to 158.0 (140.0 to 200.0) mg/dl (p < 0.001). The physical activity increased during lockdown from a GPAQ score 140 (0.0 to 1260) MetS to 840 (0.0 to 1680) MetS (p = 0.014). The improvement of glycemic control was observed in either gender and independent of the presence of foot complications or increase in physical activity.

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pneumonia disease with a severe outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which is caused by coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) with severe acute respiratory syndrome. There have been tremendous advances in in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial diagnostic of COVID-19 is based on the test of Sputum, Blood and SWAB of throat and nose. The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours but shortened to minimum of 45 hr. Another method of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min and has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA). A range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulin produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection i.e, immunoglobulin (IgM) and immunoglobulin (IgG). In this review, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss various diagnostic method of COVID-19, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for eradiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright \u00a9 Journal of Global Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia, now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in Wuhan, China. To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. Research Question: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Study Design and Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. Result(s): Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0degreeC) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days).

BACKGROUND COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Analysis of false negative results in throat swab nucleic acid test of severe acute resporatory syndrome coronavirus 2. Objective To investigate the false negative rate of throat swab nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to analyze the causes, so as to provide references for the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on the throat swab nucleic acid test results of 1 452 COVID-19 patients admitted to Guanggu Branch of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital of Hubei Province from Feb. 19 to Mar. 20, 2020. The negative results before positive results at discharge were judged as false negative results, and the false negative rate was calculated. The discharged patients were followed up to screen for the patients who were positive for nucleic acid test again, and the relationship between the times of consecutive negative nucleic acid tests before discharge and the positive again results was analyzed. Results Among the 1 452 COVID-19 patients, 592 (40.77%) were males and 860 (59.23%) were females. A total of 212 cases (14.60%) had false negative results. Twenty-eight cases (1.93%) were discovered nucleic acid positive again after discharge. Among the 918 patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for two consecutive times, 24 (2.61%) were positive again, which was significantly higher than that of the patients whose nucleic acid tests were negative for three consecutive times (0.75%, 4/534; chi2=6.21, P=0.012 7). Conclusion The throat swab nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 has a certain proportion of false negative results, which is one of the reasons for COVID-19 patients are found nucleic acid positive again after discharge. Multiple and continuous tests by different testers are recommended before discharge, and negative nucleic acid test for three or more consecutive times can reduce the incidence of nucleic acid positive results again after discharge.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Second Military Medical University Press.

Many research teams all over the world focus their research on the SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes the so-called COVID-19 disease. Most of the studies identify the main protease or 3C-like protease (Mpro/3CLpro) as a valid target for large-spectrum inhibitors. Also, the interaction of the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the viral surface glycoprotein (S) is studied in depth. Structural studies tried to identify the residues responsible for enhancement/weaken virus-ACE2 interactions or the cross-reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies. Although the understanding of the immune system and the hyper-inflammatory process in COVID-19 are crucial for managing the immediate and the long-term consequences of the disease, not many X-ray/NMR/cryo-EM crystals are available. In addition to 3CLpro, the crystal structures of other nonstructural proteins offer valuable information for elucidating some aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 is currently mainly focused on three directions-finding Mpro/3CLpro inhibitors, the virus-host cell invasion, and the virus-neutralizing antibody interaction.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Type I IFN-dependent antibody response at the basis of sex dimorphism in the outcome of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, induces severe pneumonia mainly in elderly males. Epidemiological data clearly indicate sex-based differences in disease outcomes, with men accounting for about 70 % of deaths, despite similar susceptibility to infection. It is well known that females are endowed with higher capacity to produce antibodies, which correlates with viral clearance and disease resolution in the context of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many X-linked immune genes escape X inactivation showing biallelic expression in female immune cells, particularly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). PDCs are more active in females and endowed with high capability to induce IFN-alpha-mediated B cell activation and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells throughout epigenetic mechanisms linked to trained immunity. Thus, we hypothesize that following SARS-CoV-2 infection, epigenetic modifications of X-linked genes involved in pDC-mediated type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling occurs more effectively in females, for inducing neutralizing antibody response as an immune correlate driving sex-biased disease outcome.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was proposed to be associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study aimed to explore the kinetics of IL-6 levels, validate this association in COVID-19 patients, and report preliminary data on the efficacy of IL-6 receptor blockade., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institutional study of 901 consecutive confirmed cases. Serum IL-6 concentrations were tested on admission and/or during hospital stay. Tocilizumab was given to 16 patients with elevated IL-6 concentration., RESULTS: 366 patients were defined as common cases, 411 patients as severe, and 124 patients as critical according to the Chinese guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The median concentration of IL-6 was < 1.5 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-2.15), 1.85 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-5.21), and 21.55 pg/ml (IQR 6.47-94.66) for the common, severe, and critical groups respectively (P < 0.001). The follow-up kinetics revealed serum IL-6 remained high in critical patients even when cured. An IL-6 concentration higher than 37.65 pg/ml was predictive of in-hospital death (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.95-0.99], P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 95.7%. In the 16 patients who received tocilizumab, IL-6 concentrations were significantly increased after administration, and survival outcome was not significantly different from that of propensity-score matched counterparts (n = 53, P = 0.12)., CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 should be included in diagnostic work-up to stratify disease severity, but the benefit of tocilizumab needs further confirmation.

Introduction: No data are provided about the effect of triple combination therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPN/RTN), hydroxychloroquine (HQ) and azithromycin (AZT) on corrected QT (QTc) interval and arrhythmic risk, in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to describe the incidence of extreme QTc interval prolongation among COVID-19 patients on this experimental treatment and to identify the clinical features associated with extreme QTc prolongation., Materials and Methods: Data of 87 COVID-19 patients, treated with triple combination including LPN/RTN, HQ and AZT, were analyzed. QT interval was obtained by the tangent method and corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula. Extreme QTc interval prolongation was considered an absolute QTc interval >= 500 ms or an increase in QTc intervals of 60 ms or greater (DELTAQTc >= 60 ms) compared with baseline., Results: Hypertension (66.7%) and diabetes (25.3%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities. Twenty patients (23%) showed extreme QTc interval prolongation; no clinical, electrocardiographic or pharmacological characteristics have been associated to extreme QTc prolongation, except the history of ischemic stroke (P= 0,007). One torsade de pointes (TdP) in patient with QTc extreme prolongation (QTc: 560 ms) after 5 days of therapy was recorded., Conclusions: We observed a high incidence of extreme QTc interval prolongation among COVID-19 patients on triple combination therapy. Since the incidence of malignant arrhythmias seems to be not negligible, a careful electrocardiographic monitoring would be advisable.

{"text": "IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REACTIONS AFTER PEANUT INGESTION: A DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGE. Introduction: Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a distinct entity from IgE-mediated food allergy. We present a case in which a patient has a history consistent with both diagnoses to a single food allergen. Case Description: An exclusively breast-fed 5-month-old female initially presented with repetitive emesis 2 hours after consumption of egg, which was accompanied by a delayed rash. Given overlap of symptoms, testing was performed as a diagnostic aid for distinguishing between FPIES and IgE mediated food allergy. Egg white IgE was 0.43 ku/L, and peanut IgE was 0.26 ku/L with completely negative components. After counseling and shared decision making, the caregiver was motivated to introduce small amounts of peanut at home during COVID as a preventative intervention for the development of IgE mediated allergy. After peanut ingestion, the infant first had delayed emesis. At a later date, the caregiver gave a reduced dose of peanut and the patient had an immediate reaction of hives and facial edema requiring epinephrine. Discussion(s): FPIES and IgE-mediated allergy can be differentiated by history with attention to timing and accompanying symptoms. It is known that patients with FPIES can develop IgE antibodies to trigger foods (atypical FPIES), signifying a likelihood of a more protracted FPIES course and transition to acute reactions. In our patient however, peanut ingestion resulted in distinct episodes with both FPIES and IgE-mediated symptoms, perhaps signifying a further need for understanding of the relationship between the two disorders.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Deploying machine and deep learning models for efficient data-augmented detection of COVID-19 infections. This generation faces existential threats because of the global assault of the novel Corona virus 2019 (i.e., COVID-19). With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on \"flattening the curve\". While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

{"text": "TELEMEDICINE AND AT-HOME IVF KIT: NOVEL APPLICATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to fertility has been difficult due to fear of contracting the virus. Many patients, especially those with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), strongly desire to pursue their fertility treatments that include oocyte and/or embryo freezing for fertility preservation because it is a time-sensitive matter fearing the loss of all their ovarian reserve. Given this challenging situation and in order to minimize the repeated office visits for monitoring during an IVF cycle, we aimed to test the efficacy of a new modality for IVF treatment using telemedicine and a patented kit called At-HOME IVF kit. Design(s): Large fertility clinic with university affiliation. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study assessed the outcome of using telemedicine with At-HOME IVF kit in patients who have DOR (n=22) based on previous history of poor ovarian response, previously documented low serum anti-Mullerian hormone (<1 ng/mL), elevated day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone (>10 mIU/mL), or low antral follicle count (<8). Patients desired either embryo (n=17) or oocyte (n=5) freezing. Telemedicine was used for consultation in order to reduce the total waiting time for seeking fertility treatment and to minimize office visits. The kit was mailed to the patient's home, contained no injectable medications and contained all the necessary medications needed for ovarian stimulation, ovulation suppression, and oocyte maturation trigger. The oral pills were clomid 100 mg taken from cycle day 3 until cycle day 11 and letrozole 5 mg taken from cycle day 3 until cycle day 7, the vaginal pill was the GnRH antagonist (Elagolix) 50 mg taken on cycle days 9 and 11, and nasal spray (lupron 30 IU) taken on cycle days 12 and 13. Oocyte retrieval was then performed on cycle day 14. Each patient took the medications included in the kit without office visits for monitoring and presented only on the day of the oocyte retrieval. The main outcome included the number of oocytes and embryos (cleavage-stage or blastocyst-stage) cryopreserved. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, embryo transfer was not currently recommended or performed. Data are presented as mean +/- sem. Result(s): The mean age of the participants was 39.9 +/- 0.9 years. Upon presentation on the day of oocyte retrieval, blood hormonal testing and transvaginal ultrasound showed that none of the patients had ovulated and that all patients had appropriate ovarian stimulation response with the number of mature follicles (>18mm) up to 8 (3.3 +/- 0.4). All patients underwent oocyte retrieval with 21 out of 22 patients having up to 8 mature oocytes collected (2.4 +/- 0.4). Ten out of 17 patients who underwent IVF had up to 4 embryos cryopreserved at either the cleavage-stage or blastocyst stage. Conclusion(s): During the global health emergency and current/future pandemics due to a highly transmissible infectious organism, oocyte and embryo cryopreservation can be performed without frequent monitoring and without the injectable medications using At-HOME IVF kit. This will allow patients with DOR the possibility of proceeding with fertility treatments with minimum exposure to office visits.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus \"severe acute respiratory syndrome 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered as the cause of a pneumonia-like illness and subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 spread and is now a global pandemic. With few exceptions, countries in the Northern hemisphere have higher mortality rates from COVID-19. This may be due to an increased prevalence of older people in Northern Europe at higher risk of having cardio-pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities as well as hypovitaminosis D. With increasing age, immunosenescence and \"inflammaging\" lead to impaired and maladaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections, contributing to the enhanced prevalence of severe COVID-19 in older patients. The association of ageing with increased Vitamin D deficiency which is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and disease and worse prognosis in COVID-19 infection, is discussed. Considerable experimental evidence demonstrates the immuno-modulatory properties of Vitamin D, in particular, its role in regulating and suppressing the inflammatory cytokine response to viral respiratory infections links the importance of Vitamin D sufficiency as a potential protective factor in COVID-19. There is an urgent need for prospective randomised studies to examine whether hypovitaminosis D correlates with severity of COVID-19 disease and the actual benefit of repletion. Moreover, given what has been described as a \"pandemic of Vitamin D deficiency\", especially in Europe, and in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion, the authors support the call for public health doctors and physicians, with support from Governments, to prioritise and strengthen recommendations on Vitamin D intake and supplementation.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The incidence of nosocomial candidemia was 8.9% (n=8). Case-control matching identified 24 patients with similar disease severity at the time of ICU admission. Median time to first isolation of yeast was 26 days. Candidemia patients reported longer median ICU stay than controls. (40 vs. 10 days, p=0.004). In hospital death rates were comparable in both groups (38% vs. 54%, p=0.548). Prolonged mechanical ventilation support was associated with the development of nosocomial candidemia.

{"text": "Comparative Survival Analysis of Immunomodulatory Therapy for COVID-19 'Cytokine Storm'. BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is a marker of COVID-19 illness severity and increased mortality. Immunomodulatory treatments have been repurposed to improve mortality outcomes. RESEARCH QUESTION: To identify if immunomodulatory therapies improve survival in patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 were included. Cytokine storm was defined by inflammatory markers: ferritin >700ng/mL, C-reactive protein >30mg/dL or lactate dehydrogenase >300U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups-no immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either corticosteroids, anti-interleukin 6 antibody (tocilizumab) or anti-interleukin-1 therapy (anakinra) alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. RESULT(S): 5,776 patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (44-59%), diabetes (32-46%) and cardiovascular disease (5-14%). Patients most frequently met criteria with high lactate dehydrogenase (76.2%) alone or in combination, followed by ferritin (63.2%) and C-reactive protein (8.4%). More than 80% of patients had an elevated D-dimer. Patients treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab combination had lower mortality compared to standard of care (Hazard Ratio (HR):0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35-0.55; p<0.0001) and when compared to corticosteroids alone (HR:0.66, 95%CI: 0.53-0.83; p-value=0.004), or in combination with anakinra (HR:0.64, 95%CI:0.50-0.81; p-value=0.003) . Corticosteroids when administered alone (HR:0.66, 95%CI:0.57-0.76; p<0.0001) or in combination with tocilizumab (HR:0.43, 95%CI:0.35-0.55; p<0.0001) or anakinra (HR:0.68, 95%CI:0.57-0.81; p<0.0001) improved hospital survival compared to standard of care. INTERPRETATION: The combination of corticosteroids with tocilizumab had superior survival outcome when compared to standard of care and corticosteroids alone or in combination with anakinra. Furthermore, corticosteroid use either alone or in combination with tocilizumab or anakinra was associated with reduced hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm compared to standard of care.Copyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on cancer immunotherapy in Italy: A survey of young oncologists. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed the health systems worldwide. Data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients (CPs) undergoing or candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are lacking. We depicted the practice and adaptations in the management of patients with solid tumors eligible or receiving ICIs during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a special focus on Campania region. Methods This survey (25 questions), promoted by the young section of SCITO (Societa Campana di ImmunoTerapia Oncologica) Group, was circulated among Italian young oncologists practicing in regions variously affected by the pandemic: high (group 1), medium (group 2) and low (group 3) prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. For Campania region, the physician responders were split into those working in cancer centers (CC), university hospitals (UH) and general hospitals (GH). Percentages of agreement, among High (H) versus Medium (M) and versus Low (L) group for Italy and among CC, UH and GH for Campania region, were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and chi 2 test for trends relative to the questions with 3 or more options. Results This is the first Italian study to investigate the COVID-19 impact on cancer immunotherapy, unique in its type and very clear in the results. The COVID-19 pandemic seemed not to affect the standard practice in the prescription and delivery of ICIs in Italy. Telemedicine was widely used. There was high consensus to interrupt immunotherapy in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and to adopt ICIs with longer schedule interval. The majority of the responders tended not to delay the start of ICIs; there were no changes in supportive treatments, but some of the physicians opted for delaying surgeries (if part of patients' planned treatment approach). The results from responders in Campania did not differ significantly from the national ones. Conclusion Our study highlights the efforts of Italian oncologists to maintain high standards of care for CPs treated with ICIs, regardless the regional prevalence of COVID-19, suggesting the adoption of similar solutions. Research on patients treated with ICIs and experiencing COVID-19 will clarify the safety profile to continue the treatments, thus informing on the most appropriate clinical conducts.

{"text": "Guillain-Barre syndrome after COVID-19 in Japan. We report the first case of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Japan. A 54-year-old woman developed neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested for various antiganglioside antibodies, that had not been investigated in previous cases. The patient was diagnosed with GBS based on neurological and electrophysiological findings; no antiganglioside antibodies were detected. In previous reports, most patients with SARS-CoV-2-infection-related GBS had lower limb predominant symptoms, and antiganglioside antibody tests were negative. Our findings support the notion that non-immune abnormalities such as hyperinflammation following cytokine storms and microvascular disorders due to vascular endothelial damage may lead to neurological symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

{"text": "Results from the IRoc-GN international registry of patients with COVID-19 and glomerular disease suggest close monitoring. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on individuals with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, who are often undergoing immunosuppressive treatments, are unknown. Therefore, we created the International Registry of COVID infection in glomerulonephritis (IRoc-GN), and identified 40 patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 followed in centers in North America and Europe. Detailed information on glomerulonephritis diagnosis, kidney parameters, and baseline immunosuppression prior to infection were recorded, as well as clinical presentation, laboratory values, treatment, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19. This cohort was compared to 80 COVID-positive control cases from the general population without glomerulonephritis matched for the time of infection. The majority (70%) of the patients with glomerulonephritis and all the controls were hospitalized. Patients with glomerulonephritis had significantly higher mortality (15% vs. 5%, respectively) and acute kidney injury (39% vs. 14%) than controls, while the need for kidney replacement therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. Receiving immunosuppression or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors at presentation did not increase the risk of death or acute kidney injury in the glomerulonephritis cohort. In the cohort with glomerulonephritis, lower serum albumin at presentation and shorter duration of glomerular disease were associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and need for kidney replacement therapy. No differences in outcomes occurred between patients with primary glomerulonephritis versus glomerulonephritis associated with a systemic autoimmune disease (lupus or vasculitis). Thus, due to the higher mortality and risk of acute kidney injury than in the general population without glomerulonephritis, patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 should be carefully monitored, especially when they present with low serum albumin levels.

{"text": "The Gendered Poverty Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Colombia. Everyone, across borders, race and gender, is affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic-but not equally. In this paper, we examine a burgeoning new literature discussing the employment effects of COVID-19. We explore the extent to which COVID-19 will exacerbate gendered employment disparities, income generation gaps, and, ultimately, poverty gaps, using a simple microsimulation methodology. We test our approach in Colombia, which has implemented an unparalleled number of mitigation measures and has reopened its economy earlier than regional neighbors. We find that COVID-19 increases the poverty headcount to a daunting degree (between 3.0 and 9.1 pp increases). Mitigation measures vary considerably in their individual impact (up to 0.9 pp poverty reduction). A fiscally neutral Universal Basic Income program would cause larger poverty reductions. Importantly, both men and women report similar poverty impacts from the pandemic and mitigation policies, reflecting the magnitude of the downturn, the design of interventions and our own poverty measure.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may associate with clinical manifestations, ranging from alterations in smell and taste to severe respiratory distress requiring intensive care, that might associate with weight loss and malnutrition. We aimed to assess the incidence of unintentional weight loss and malnutrition in COVID-19 survivors., METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort study, we enrolled all adult (age >=18 years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had been discharged home from either a medical ward or the Emergency Department of San Raffaele University Hospital, and were re-evaluated after remission at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-Up Clinic of the same Institution from April 7, 2020, to May 11, 2020. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters upon admission were prospectively collected. At follow-up, anthropometrics, the mini nutritional assessment screening and a visual analogue scale for appetite were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included in the analysis (33% females, median age 59.0 [49.5-67.9] years, 70% overweight/obese upon initial assessment, 73% hospitalised). Sixty-one patients (29% of the total, and 31% of hospitalised patients vs. 21% of patients managed at home, p = 0.14) had lost >5% of initial body weight (median weight loss 6.5 [5.0-9.0] kg, or 8.1 [6.1-10.9]%). Patients who lost weight had greater systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein 62.9 [29.0-129.5] vs.48.7 [16.1-96.3] mg/dL; p = 0.02), impaired renal function (23.7% vs. 8.7% of patients; p = 0.003) and longer disease duration (32 [27-41] vs. 24 [21-30] days; p = 0.047) as compared with those who did not lose weight. At multivariate logistic regression analysis, only disease duration independently predicted weight loss (OR 1.05 [1.01-1.10] p = 0.022)., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 might negatively impact body weight and nutritional status. In COVID-19 patients, nutritional evaluation, counselling and treatment should be implemented at initial assessment, throughout the course of disease, and after clinical remission.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the Truvian Easy Check coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) IgM/IgG anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody test.Serologic assays have become increasingly available for surveillance through the Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization in the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. However, widespread application of serologic assays has been curbed by reports of faulty or inaccurate tests. Therefore, rapid COVID-19 antibody tests need to be thoroughly validated prior to their implementation., METHODS: The Easy Check device was analytically evaluated and its performance was compared with the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay. The test was further characterized for cross-reactivity using sera obtained from patients infected by other viruses. Clinical performance was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed samples and a 2015 prepandemic reference sample set., RESULTS: The Easy Check device showed excellent analytical performance and compares well with the Roche Elecsys antibody assay, with an overall concordance of 98.6%. Clinical performance showed a sensitivity of 96.6%, a specificity of 98.2%, and an overall accuracy of 98.1%., CONCLUSIONS: The Easy Check device is a simple, reliable, and rapid test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, and its performance compares favorably against the automated Roche Elecsys antibody assay.

{"text": "Deletion in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in some of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome. The envelope glycoprotein (E) is the smallest structural component of SARS-CoVs; plays an essential role in the viral replication starting from envelope formation to assembly. The in silico analysis of 2086 whole genome sequences from India performed in this study provides the first observation on the extensive deletion of amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in 34 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These amino acid deletions map to the homopentameric interface and PDZ binding motif (PBM) present in the C-terminal region of E protein as well as immediately after the reverse primer binding region as per Charite protocol in 26 of these genomes, hence, their detection through RT-qPCR may not be hampered and therefore E gene-based RT-qPCR would still detect these isolates. Eight genomes from the State of Odisha had deletion even in the primer binding site. It is possible that the deletions in the C-terminal region of E protein of these genomes are a result of adapting to a newer geographical area and host. The information on the clinical status was available only for 9 out of 34 cases and these were asymptomatic. However, further studies are indispensable to understand the functional consequences of amino acid deletion in the C terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein in the viral pathogenesis and host adaptation.

{"text": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Asthma. BACKGROUND: An association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of certain chronic conditions has been suggested. However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the disease burden in patients with asthma has been less evident., OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of COVID-19 in patients with asthma., METHODS: Using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager R clinical platform, we analysed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020., RESULTS: Out of 71 182 patients with asthma, 1006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 versus 42 years), predominantly female (66% versus 59%), smoked more frequently, and had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity. Allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less common in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (p<.001). Higher prevalence of these comorbidities was also observed in patients with COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalisation due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalised patients (48.3% versus 61.5%; OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). Although patients treated with biologics (n=865; 1.21%) showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ENT level, COVID-19-related hospitalisations in these patients were relatively low (0.23%)., CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors.

{"text": "COVID-19 FEARS MAY BE WORSE THAN THE VIRUS: A CASE OF CARDIOGENIC SHOCK SECONDARY TO POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION VENTRICULAR SEPTUM RUPTURE. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is an uncommon but fatal mechanical complication of Myocardial infarction (MI). The event occurs 2-8 days after infarction and often precipitates cardiogenic shock. The incidence of Postinfarct VSR had declined over the years due to early reperfusion capabilities but is a surgical emergency even if the patients are hemodynamically stable. CASE PRESENTATION: An 87 years old Caucasian woman with a known history of hypertension and arthritis presented to the emergency department with non-exertional epigastric, non-radiating sharp chest pain for the past several days. The patient states that her chest pain was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerine. The patient stated that she was scared to come to the ED, as she doesn't want to catch COVID-19 from the hospital. The patient denied any shortness of breath or palpitation. Physical Examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission were noted for WBC - 15.19 cells/mcL, D-Dimer 3.08 mg/L, and Troponin 3.66 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml in 2nd recheck. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with T wave inversion in the lateral leads (Figure 1). The patient was initiated on a heparin drip according to ACS protocol and titrated with aPTT results. A loading dose of aspirin was received with atorvastatin 40mg and metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID. Cardiology was consulted, and subsequently, cardiac catheterization showed significant stenosis of LAD s/p placement of Drug-eluting stent (Figure 2). She was given DAPTs (Aspirin 81mg + Clopidogrel 75mg daily) post-PCI. Echocardiogram showed a reduced ejection fraction (EF) 35-40% with wall motion abnormality on LAD territory. Few hours post-cardiac catheterization, the patient acutely decompensated and became less responsive. Her lab data were showing acutely worsening of leukocytosis 23.48 cells/mcL, Na 147 mmol/L, Creatinine 2.40 mg/dl, and troponin 96.1ng/ml. EKG found out new ST-T waves abnormality in the anteroseptal and lateral leads. Stat Echocardiogram showed a new membranous ventricular septal defect (Figure 3). The patient developed a cardiogenic shock, requiring three vasopressors (Epinephrine, dobutamine, and vasopressin) but continued to deteriorate and triggered code blue. The family was notified for the goal of care and switched for palliative care before the patient passes away. DISCUSSION: Risk factors for higher mortality from acute VSD are female sex, advanced age, arterial hypertension, anterior wall AMI, absence of previous AMI, and late arrival at the hospital. Surgical repair for VSR should be carried out on an emergency basis, even if the patient is hemodynamically stable. CONCLUSION(S): VSR is a surgical emergency but patients who develop VSR with multiorgan failure may not be a candidate for surgery and should consider palliative care.

{"text": "Trauma center activity and surge response during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic - The Philadelphia story. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed all facets of healthcare delivery. Trauma centers serve as regional resource sites for high-acuity patients; so careful planning is required to maintain access to trauma care during an infectious pandemic. Guidance from the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) provides a general framework for the pandemic response, but these precepts must be contextualized to local and regional factors. The Level I trauma centers in Philadelphia collaborated to implement this guidance and to share insights throughout the early phase of the pandemic. For this report, we examined the volume, acuity, and mechanisms of presenting trauma patients and the number and acuity of COVID-19 admissions during the pandemic. We also assessed the geospatial relationship between firearm incidents and COVID-19 case density. Finally, we collated the collaborative measures taken to maintain trauma access and team safety and evaluated the effect of these measures. Over the first 6 weeks of the pandemic, trauma contacts totaled 1,058 patients across all centers representing a 20% decrease compared with the same time last year. However, the number of penetrating trauma cases increased with a significant correlation between shooting locations and high-density COVID areas. During this time, Philadelphia trauma centers admitted a total of 1,413 confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 23% required mechanical ventilation. Divert status was activated for only 1.6% of available hours, and five of six centers remained open to all trauma transfers over the entire study period. Thus, through deliberate efforts to adapt ACS-COT guidelines and share lessons learned, the Level I trauma centers in Philadelphia maintained trauma access while simultaneously responding to the high-acuity infectious pandemic. This approach can be employed by other metropolitan areas and trauma systems to assure readiness during a prolonged crisis with large volumes of high-acuity trauma and nontrauma patients.Copyright \u00a9 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

{"text": "Probing gold nanoparticles for the desensitization to beta-lactoglobulin from binding mechanism, structure and IgE binding changes. Because of the adsorption of proteins, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) create potential biological risks in biomedicine, leading to the formation of the protein corona. This adsorption is mainly due to the formation of gold-sulfur (AuS) covalent bonds between the AuNPs and the -SH groups, causing bioactivity denaturation and biological problems; however, it could also lead to some biological benefits. We explored AuNPs as a potential material for desensitization to allergens, such as beta-lactoglobulin (betaLG). To address the desensitization of AuNPs, we investigated the binding mechanism and the specific relationship of the time evolution of AuS bond, secondary structure, and allergy changes. The formation of AuS bond takes approximately 9 h, consistent with the complete changes time in secondary structure and immunoglobulin E (IgE) combining capacity of the betaLG, decreasing allergic reactions.

SESSION TITLE: Pulmonary Vascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and high mortality, however, 70-81% of all cases are classified as non-severe. COVID-19 disease is being increasingly recognized as a prothrombotic state with a high incidence of coagulopathy. Up to 30% of intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 develop a venous thromboembolism (VTE). Limited studies of non-ICU and non-mechanically ventilated patients have suggested a 5 to 10% risk of VTE. However, these studies have been limited in scope and may not be generalizable to patients seen in the United States. The goal of this study is to further characterize non-critically ill COVID-19 patients at our institution who develop VTEs. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the electronic medical record. It examined all adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab who were not mechanically ventilated during hospitalization and who were discharged alive from three hospitals comprising an integrated health system in Bronx, NY between March 11, 2020 and May 2, 2020. Patients were eligible for study inclusion if an upper or lower extremity duplex or Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging with contrast to rule out PE was performed during admission or within 14 days of discharge. Summary statistics were used to characterize patients with and without VTE based on imaging findings. Unpaired two-tailed t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test or test of proportion were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 2671 adult inpatients with COVID-19 who were not mechanically ventilated and survived to discharge, 313 (11.7%) completed CT or duplex imaging to identify VTE, and 72 patients (72/2671, 2.7%) were found to have a confirmed VTE. Out of the 72 VTE identified, 31 were located in peripheral veins, 38 were in pulmonary veins, and 3 were in both peripheral and pulmonary veins. Compared to patients without VTE on imaging, patients with VTE were of similar age (60.3 vs 61.5 years, p=0.55) and body mass index (30.8 vs 30.2, p=0.56). Patients who developed a VTE had a longer length of stay (10 vs 8 days, p=0.02) and a more elevated admission white blood cell count (10.3 vs 8.4 k/uL, p=0.002), d-dimer (4.37 vs 1.67 ug/mL, p<0.001) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (474 vs 373 mg/dL, p=0.005). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19 who survive to discharge may be prone to developing VTE, though their baseline risk factors for COVID-19 related disease were the same as those without a VTE in our cohort. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Laboratory findings at the time of admission may help identify those patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of being diagnosed with VTE.

{"text": "A RECOVERED CASE OF COVID-19 MYOCARDITIS TREATED WITH IV IMMUNOGLOBULIN. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Cardiovascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of myocarditis in COVID-19 remains unknown as diagnosing myocarditis can be challenging. As per an estimate, up to 7% of death in Covid-19 might be related to myocarditis (1). CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes presented with cough and worsening dyspnea for 8 days. In ER, he was hypoxic (SpO2 75% on room air) requiring intubation for respiratory failure. Chest Xray showed bilateral diffuse opacities (Fig 1). SARS-Cov2 Rt-PCR was positive. Labs were significant for leukocytosis, elevated troponin, inflammatory markers, and abnormal liver, renal function tests (Tab 1). EKG (Fig 2) showed age indeterminate inferior infarct versus left anterior fascicular block. In the ICU, the patient was in shock with multi-organ failure requiring 4 vasoactive drugs. 2D ECHO showed EF <30% along with akinesis of the mid to apical myocardial segments (Fig 3). The shock was believed to be cardiogenic and distributive (PaSat 95%). Vancomycin and Cefepime were administered. He received Immunoglobulins (IVIG) for suspicion for viral myocarditis and pulse dose steroids for the cytokine storm. Renal replacement therapy was initiated for acute kidney injury and N acetylcysteine for acute liver injury. The patient had uncontrolled hyperglycemia requiring insulin drip. After 3 days of intensive therapy, the vasoactive agents were weaned off as the patient showed significant clinical improvement. The cultures showed no growth. EKG (Fig 4) showed nonspecific T wave changes however, myocardial infarction findings were no longer present. A repeat 2D ECHO on day 10 showed normalization of ventricular function. Despite antibiotics, he continued to be febrile with persistent leukocytosis. On day 13, Voriconazole was started for aspergillus fumigatus in respiratory culture and elevated fungitell level. By day 20, he was successfully liberated off the ventilator with minimal oxygen supplementation. He was discharged to acute rehabilitation on day 46 with outpatient hemodialysis. DISCUSSION: The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response (2). The hypothesis behind the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is that it may replace antibodies, augment viral clearance, and enhance clearance of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to myocyte destruction. IVIG therapy has been linked with the superior recovery of left ventricular function and lower mortality in patients with acute myocarditis (3). However, the use of Immunoglobulins in myocarditis remains controversial. CONCLUSION(S): In our case, early aggressive treatment of suspected myocarditis with IVIG therapy likely contributed to our patient's rapid recovery. A large randomized controlled trial is required to determine the efficacy of immunoglobulins in Covid-19 related myocarditis. Reference #1: Driggin E, Madhavan MV, Bikdeli B, et al.

The clinical significance of high crossing threshold (Ct) detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR is inadequately defined. In the course of universal admission screening with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay at our institution, we observed that 3.9 % (44/1123) of SARS-CoV-2 positive results were negative for the envelope (E) gene target but positive for the nucleocapsid (N2) target. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate during the three-month study period was 15.4 % (1123/7285), spanning April-June 2020. The majority of patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were asymptomatic, with 29.5 % of patients symptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of presentation. Asymptomatic patients with E-negative, N2-positive results were significantly younger than symptomatic patients with the same results (average 37.6 vs. 58.4, p = 0.003). Similar proportions of prior SARS-CoV-2 positivity were noted among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (38.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.82). Among the 16 asymptomatic patients with radiographic imaging performed, four (25 %) had chest radiographic findings concerning for viral pneumonia. Interestingly, we observed an E-negative, N2-positive result in one patient with a previous SARS-CoV-2 by the Xpert Xpress that occurred 71 days prior. Critically, E-negative, N2-positive results were observed in 8 symptomatic patients with a new diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, though concerns remain about extended SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in some patients, the ability of clinical laboratories to detect patients with high Ct values (including E-negative, N2-positive results) is vital for retaining maximal sensitivity for diagnostic purposes. Our data show that a finding of E-positive, N2-negative SARS-CoV-2 should not be used to rule out the presence of subclinical infection. Copyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "Clinical performances of three fully automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays targeting the nucleocapsid or spike proteins. INTRODUCTION: This study assesses the clinical performances of three anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays, namely EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (IgG) ELISA, Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (total antibodies) assay, and LIAISON anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1 and S2 (IgG) assay., METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven COVID-19 samples from 96 RT-PCR confirmed patients were used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 141) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis., RESULTS: None of these tests demonstrated a sufficiently high clinical sensitivity to diagnose acute infection. Fourteen days since symptom onset, we did not reveal any significant difference between the three techniques in terms of sensitivities. However, the Elecsys performed better in terms of specificity., CONCLUSION: All three anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays had equivalent sensitivities 14 days from symptom onset to diagnose past-COVID-19 infection. We also confirmed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 determination before day 14 is of less clinical interest. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

There are further symptomatic hints that the ABO blood group system contributes to these correlations. Remarkably, the susceptibility to both the viral disease and iron dyshomeostasis can be traced back to the same gene loci of the ABO blood group system.

A microtiter complement fixation (CF) test to detect transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) viral antigen was developed, using TGE hyperimmune pig serum as an antibody source. Sera from TGE convalescent pigs did not fix complement by this test. Maximal virus and soluble antigen (SA) titers were obtained 36 to 48 hr after inoculation of swine testes cells. Cell associated virus and SA titers were higher than those in the culture fluid, which had to be concentrated 20x before use as antigen in agar immunodiffusion tests (ID).

The practicability of a prototype capillary whole-blood IgG-IgM COVID-19 self-test (Exacto COVID-19 self-test, Biosynex Swiss SA, Freiburg, Switzerland) as a serological screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection adapted to the general public was evaluated in a cross-sectional, general adult population study performed between April and May 2020 in Strasbourg, France, consisting of face-to-face, paper-based, semi-structured, and self-administrated questionnaires. Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6-100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5-23.6) asked for verbal help. The percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.5-99.4). However, misinterpretation occurred in only 2.3% of positive and 1.2% of invalid test results. Finally, all (100%) participants found that performing the COVID-19 self-test was easy; and 98.8% found the interpretation of the self-test results easy. Taken together, these pilot observations demonstrated for the first-time, high practicability and satisfaction of COVID-19 self-testing for serological IgG and IgM immune status, indicating its potential for use by the general public to complete the arsenal of available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in the urgent context of the COVID-19 epidemic.Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Tonen-Wolyec et al.

{"text": "The assessment of transmission efficiency and latent infection period in asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies have focused on the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our follow-up study was performed on 147 asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province. Of these, 50.0% were male, 50.3% were older than 40 years, 43.8% were farmers, and 68.7% were from the north of Anhui Province. 16 of the 147 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms in the following 14 days of isolated observation, and were subsequently diagnosed as confirmed cases. The possible latent infection period was found to range from 1-5 days before onset, with a median time of 2 days. The second attack rate for the 16 confirmed cases who had transferred from being asymptomatic carriers was 9.7% (23/236 close contacts), while for the 131 asymptomatic carriers the rate was 2.6% (24/914 close contacts), showing a significant difference in second attack rate between the two groups (p<0.001). Our study indicated that COVID-19 cases are contagious during the incubation period, and that close contact screening should be extended to include the incubation period.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) has created an urgent need to identify child abuse and neglect (CAN) and efficiently allocate resources to improve the coordination of responses during a public health crisis. Objective(s): To provide unique insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of CAN in relation to COVID-19 outcomes and identify areas where CAN has increased or decreased during the pandemic. Participant(s): Children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Setting(s): CAN incidents in the city of Los Angeles. Method(s): Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the implementation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored. Result(s): There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has created a worldwide pandemic. Many patients with this infection have an asymptomatic or mild illness, but a small percentage of patients require hospitalization and intensive care. Patients with respiratory tract involvement have a spec-trum of presentations that range from scattered ground-glass infiltrates to diffuse infiltrates with consolidation. Patients with the latter radiographic presentation have severe hypoxemia and usually require mechanical ventilation. In addition, some patients develop multiorgan fail-ure, deep venous thrombi with pulmonary emboli, and cytokine storm syndrome. The respiratory management of these patients should focus on using low tidal volume ventilation with low intrathoracic pressures. Some patients have significant recruitable lung and may benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and/or prone positioning. There is no well-established anti-viral treatment for this infection; the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma and remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, randomized trials have demonstrated that dexamethasone improves outcomes in patients on mechanical ventilators or on oxygen. There are ongoing trials of other drugs which have the potential to moderate the acute inflammatory state seen in some of these patients. These patients often need prolonged high-level intensive care.

Social distancing and the testing have been the principal measures that have shown to be effective for the reduction of critical cases. Although the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is the RT-PCR, rapid serological tests could also be used for prevalence studies, and for epidemiological monitoring. In order to characterize the humoral immune response, we analyzed eight immuno-chromatographic test and one ELISA test, as a verification or secondary validation analysis used positive and negative control serum samples. Sera from negative and positive individuals [asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals, outpatient or inpatientor (intensive care unit)] were analyzed, and the following results were found: of all these rapid tests, only 4 exhibit clear banding patterns for IgG and two of these also showed results for IgM (only in a few symptomatic patients). Instead, with an ELISA test a preferential recognition was observed for symptomatic patients who were critically ill, whereas in asymptomatic individuals it did not show more than 25% of positivity.

{"text": "Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Antigens in Humans and Animals. To optimize the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we must first understand the antibody response to individual proteins on the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the antibody's cross reactivity to other coronaviruses. Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in naive individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on non-S1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies. We conclude that substantial variation in antibody generation against coronavirus proteins will influence interpretations of serologic data in the clinical and veterinary settings.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "PROTEINACEOUS COVID-19. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is characterized by the accumulation of amorphous lipoproteins in the distal air spaces which impairs gas exchange, causing hypoxia. Incidence is around 0.2 cases per million and it is more commonly seen in males (1). Herein, we describe a rare case of PAP in a middle-aged female who was subsequently affected with COVID-19 CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old Hispanic lady with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the outpatient clinic with worsening dyspnea on exertion for 7 months and chronic cough with whitish sputum production. She was a homemaker and had no family history of any lung disease. Physical examination showed that the patient was dyspneic. The lung examination was remarkable for inspiratory crackles in bilateral lung fields. Pulmonary function tests revealed reduced FVC: 1.79L (64% of predicted) and FEV1: 1.54L (68% of predicted) with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio of 82%. DLCO was 11.2 mL/min/mmHg (55%) suggestive of moderate restrictive disease and a moderate reduction in diffusion capacity. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial opacities, computed tomography (CT) thorax confirmed the same. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy biopsies were positive for periodic acid of Schiff (PAS) lipo-proteinaceous material. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies were positive. Rituximab was started and she underwent therapeutic whole lung lavage (WLL) which relieved her symptoms. Eight months later, she presented to the emergency department with similar complaints. Initially, it was thought to be PAP flare, but vitals were remarkable for tachycardia, a saturation of 72% on room air, and a fever of 101 F. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis, elevated d-dimer, and ferritin. The patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. CT pulmonary angiogram revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and COVID-19 was positive. She was on vasopressors and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, and tocilizumab. Later, she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: PAP can be complicated with infection with Nocardia species, Mycobacterium species, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, P. carinii, and viruses due to impaired macrophage function and impaired host defense which favors the growth of microorganisms. No case of COVID19 pneumonia has been reported in a patient with PAP to the best of our knowledge(2). CONCLUSION(S): The disease course of PAP varies, and the prognosis is unpredictable. WLL is the standard therapy and the 5-year survival of autoimmune PAP is 95% (3). Our patient was recently diagnosed with PAP. She had responded well to previous WLL and the prognosis was good until she was infected by COVID19, implying that it can have deleterious outcomes in PAP.

Our objective for the study was to report the prevalence of conduction anomalies in MIS-C and identify predictive factors for the conduction abnormalities., METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients <21 years of age presenting with MIS-C over a 1-month period. We collected clinical outcomes, laboratory findings, and diagnostic studies, including serial electrocardiograms, in all patients with MIS-C to identify those with first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) during the acute phase and assess for predictive factors., RESULTS: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Median age at admission was 9 years. Six of 32 patients (19%) were found to have first-degree AVB, with a median longest PR interval of 225 milliseconds (interquartile range 200-302), compared with 140 milliseconds (interquartile range 80-178) in patients without first-degree AVB. The onset of AVB occurred at a median of 8 days after the initial symptoms and returned to normal 3 days thereafter. No patients developed advanced AVB, although 1 patient developed a PR interval >300 milliseconds. Another patient developed new-onset right bundle branch block, which resolved during hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, and cardiac function were not associated with AVB development., CONCLUSIONS: In our population, there is a 19% prevalence of first-degree AVB in patients with MIS-C. All patients with a prolonged PR interval recovered without progression to high-degree AVB. Patients admitted with MIS-C require close electrocardiogram monitoring during the acute phase.

{"text": "Post-Extubation Stridor Complicating COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Case Series. Post-extubation stridor is a known complication of mechanical ventilation that affects a substantial number of all critical care patients and leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Common risk factors for the development of post-extubation stridor include female gender, older age, and prolonged length of mechanical ventilation. There may be an increased incidence of post-extubation stridor in patients who require mechanical ventilation to manage the respiratory complications of COVID-19. In this case series, we analyzed nine patients from across our institution who were intubated to manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 and subsequently developed post-extubation stridor. The patients were predominantly females with prolonged intubations and multiple days of prone ventilation. While the patients in this case series possessed some of the well-described risk factors for post-extubation stridor, there may be risk factors specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that make these patients more susceptible to the complication. The cuff leak test was performed on the majority of patients in the case series and did not successfully predict successful extubation in this population. Our analysis suggests that prophylactic corticosteroids given in the 24-48 hours prior to elective extubation in female COVID-19 patients who were intubated for more than six days with consecutive days of intermittent prone ventilation may be helpful in reducing the incidence of post-extubation stridor in this population. Overall, this case series elucidates the need for exceptionally close monitoring of COVID-19 patients upon extubation for the development of stridor.

The Chi-square was used to compare difference for worry and anxiety among categorical variables. The logistic regression was used to examine the associations between worry as well as anxiety and individual as well as environmental factors. In total, 1970 respondents were recruited and completed an online survey on worry regarding COVID-19, general anxiety during the pandemic, and individual and environmental factors. In total, 51.7% and 43.4% of respondents reported high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety, respectively. Exhibited worse self-rated mental health, lower self-confidence in COVID-19 management, and insufficient mental health resources were significantly associated with high levels of both worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety. Lower perceived confidence in COVID-19 management by the regional government was associated with a higher level of worry toward COVID-19. Lower perceived social support was associated with a higher level of general anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that high levels of worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were prevalent during the outbreak. This suggests health care providers need additional surveillance of worry and anxiety during the pandemic. Multiple individual and environmental factors related to worry toward COVID-19 and general anxiety were identified.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the outbreak of infectious diseases would result in mental health problems. Females are in greater risk for psychological problems than males. The present study investigated gender differences of depression and anxiety and explored associated factors during the COVID-19 epidemic among Chinese social media users., METHODS: We recruited 3088 participants through social media cross China. Participants completed sociodemographic and the COVID-19 epidemic related questions, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2), the Chinese version of the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. We applied Chi-square test and ANOVA for data description and linear regression analysis for exploring factors associated with depression and anxiety., RESULTS: Of 3063 participants eligible for analysis, the total prevalence of depression and anxiety was 14.14 and 13.25%. Females were experiencing more severe stress and anxiety symptoms, while males showed better resilience to stress. The severity of depression symptoms would decrease with the increase of age resilience, and it would increase if being unemployed, feeling less adapted, being more stressed. The severity of anxiety symptoms would decrease with higher education and better resilience, and it would increase if being female, spending over 60 min on COVID-19 related information, less adapted, and being more stressed., CONCLUSION: The findings show the increased prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese population during the COVID-19 epidemic, and females are experiencing more severe anxiety symptoms than males. As social media is the current main resource of information related to COVID-19, interventions should be implemented to help users to limit the time they spend on social media and to get key information related to the epidemic from authoritative and authentic resource to avoid infodemic and prevent mental health problems.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Rationale: Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. Objective(s): This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Method(s): Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Result(s): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized beta = -0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized beta = -0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized beta = -0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized beta = -0.256, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized beta = -0.268, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized beta = -0.236, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.126, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The uneven morphology and the trapped charges at the surface of the traditionally used supporting substrate-based 2D biosensors produces a scattering effect, which leads to a irregular signals from individually fabricated devices. Though suspended 2D channel material has the potential to overcome scattering effects from the substrates but achieving reliability and selectivity, have been limiting the using of this biosensor technology. Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies. For evaluating the electrical characteristics of suspended MoS2 FET, gating potential was applied through an electrolyte on the suspended MoS2 transistor. This helped in achieved a lower subthreshold swing 70 mV/dec and ON/OFF ratio 107. Later, pH detection was conducted at room temperature, which showed an impressive sensitivity of ~880 by changing 1 unit of pH.

Background: Currently, there is minimal data available highlighting the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This case report with a literature review emphasizes a unique presentation of COVID-19 that is highly important for health care providers to consider when treating their patients. Case report: A 65-year-old Caucasian male patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dyspnea on exertion after his wife's recent diagnosis of COVID-19. He additionally had experienced a couple of episodes of self-resolving diarrhea a few days before presentation. Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the laboratory workup identifying an elevated D-dimer, a computed tomography angiogram of the chest was obtained, which was significant for moderately large, bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus, and an associated small, left lower lobe, pulmonary infarct. Ultrasound of the lower extremity showed non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis at the distal left femoral vein to the left popliteal vein. The patient was additionally diagnosed with COVID-19 when the results of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test returned as positive. The patient was admitted to the COVID unit, and he was started on an intravenously administered, unfractionated heparin drip for management of his bilateral pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's clinical condition improved significantly with anticoagulation, and he was observed in the hospital for 3 days, after which he was discharged home on the enoxaparin bridge with warfarin. Post-discharge telephone calls at day 10 and week 4 revealed that the patient was appropriately responding to anticoagulation treatment and had no recurrence of his symptoms related to venous thromboembolism and COVID-19. Conclusion(s): As COVID-19 continues to lead to significant mortality, more data is emerging that is exposing its perplexing pathogenicity.

SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus is responsible for the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has relevant pathogenic implications for the cardiovascular system. Incidence and severity of COVID-19 are higher in the elderly population (65 years and older). This may be due to higher frequency of comorbidities, but increased frailty and immunosenescence linked with aging may also contribute. Moreover, in elderly individuals, SARS-CoV-2 may adopt different molecular strategies to strongly impact on cardiac aging that culminate in exacerbating a pro-inflammatory state (cytokine storm activation), which, in turn, may lead to pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, microangiopathy, diffuse thrombosis, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. All these events are particularly relevant in elderly patients, and deserve targeted cardiovascular treatments and specific management of repurposed drugs against COVID-19.

{"text": "Mini-Review on the Roles of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Selenium in the Immune System against COVID-19. Low levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections. Therefore, to maximize the nutritional defense against infections, a daily allowance of vitamins and trace elements for malnourished patients at risk of or diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be beneficial. Recent studies on COVID-19 patients have shown that vitamin D and selenium deficiencies are evident in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D improves the physical barrier against viruses and stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides. It may prevent cytokine storms by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. Selenium enhances the function of cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, selenium is important for maintaining T cell maturation and functions, as well as for T cell-dependent antibody production. Vitamin C is considered an antiviral agent as it increases immunity. Administration of vitamin C increased the survival rate of COVID-19 patients by attenuating excessive activation of the immune response. Vitamin C increases antiviral cytokines and free radical formation, decreasing viral yield. It also attenuates excessive inflammatory responses and hyperactivation of immune cells.

Corona virus is a spherical shaped and enveloped positive-sense single stranded RNA virus with a size of ~30 kilobase encoding various structural, non-structural proteins and accessory proteins. The entry of coronavirus into the host cells is mediated by spike proteins which efficiently allow SARS-CoV2 to replicate in host cell by evading immune surveillance like innate and adaptive immune responses in the host cells and ultimately leads to increased virulence and disease outcome. In the current review, we highlighted the molecular insights of SARS-CoV-2 and its infection mechanism in the host cell via host-viral protein interactions based on currently available data up to 16thMay 2020 and using various research literature databases.

The cardiovascular manifestations have become more prevalent but can potentially go unrecognized. We look to describe cardiac manifestations in three patients with COVID-19 using cardiac enzymes, electrocardiograms, and echocardiography., Case summaries: The first patient, a 67-year-old Caucasian female with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, presented with dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea 1 week after testing positive for COVID-19. Echocardiogram revealed large pericardial effusion with findings consistent with tamponade. A pericardial drain was placed, and fluid studies were consistent with viral pericarditis, treated with colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone. Follow-up echocardiograms showed apical hypokinesis, that later resolved, consistent with Takotsubo syndrome. The second patient, a 46-year-old African American male with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with fevers, cough, and dyspnoea due to COVID-19. Clinical course was complicated with pulseless electrical activity arrest; he was found to have D-dimer and troponin elevation, and inferior wall ST elevation on ECG concerning for STEMI due to microemboli. The patient succumbed to the illness. The third patient, a 76-year-old African American female with hypertension, presented with diarrhoea, fever, and myalgia, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Clinical course was complicated, with acute troponin elevation, decreased cardiac index, and severe hypokinesis of the basilar wall suggestive of reverse Takotsubo syndrome. The cardiac index improved after pronation and non-STEMI therapy; however, the patient expired due to worsening respiratory status., Discussion: These case reports demonstrate cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 that required monitoring and urgent intervention.

The infection is caused due to the contagious virus, which leads to a severe respiratory disease known as COVID-19. Patients who are suffering from conjunctivitis, fever, cough and shortness of breath and those who traveled from hots spot area of corona virus or their family members are suffering from corona virus come to an ophthalmologist could be the patient suffering from corona virus or may have an infection due to covid19. Conjunctivitis patients coming from regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19, come to an ophthalmologist could be suffered from corona virus. The corona virus genome is a single-stranded RNA that causes COVID-19. The corona virus is a contagious disease which spreads from person to person through their respiratory droplets of an infected person after their coughing and sneezing. A healthy person could be infected by corona virus if people touch an object or surface with virus present from an infected person, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. In some recent articles and reports, it is suggested that corona virus can cause conjunctivitis either as an early sign or during hospitalization during severe covid19. There are chances of spreading of corona virus to eyes through aerosols or due to hands to eye contact. Covid19 patients have single-stranded RNA virus throughout the body and also in the tears of eyes, but there is no evidence of corona virus cultured in the conjunctiva of eyes. Conjunctiva congestion and follicular conjunctivitis are found in patients having confirmed diagnosis of covid19.Copyright \u00a9 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences Production and Hosted by Pharmascope", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

It is considered to be a potential zoonotic disease and is asymptomatic or flu-like.SARS is a new clinical entity of the COVID-19 outbreak. The other symptoms are fever, sore throat, cold. They spread through droplets, saliva, or sneeze. They are also transmitted to the child by placental transmission. The airborne transmission is by aerosols where droplets are >5microm. They become bioaerosols and are found to travel more than 100 meters. In experimental work, it is found that the particles of COVID can be detected 3 hours after no clinical setting. The only way to stop the spread is appropriate preventive measures like PPE, respiratory etiquette, and social distancing. There are some recent advances in the field to stop the spread of COVID-19.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and potentially lethal pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No specific antiviral treatment is currently available. The purpose of this review is to highlight the main repurposed drug treatments with in-vitro or in-vivo efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent clinical trials suggested remdesivir, IFN-beta-1b and favipiravir have potential clinical and/or virological benefits on patients with COVID-19. Short course of stress dose of corticosteroids might be used as adjunctive treatment to patients who are late presenters with cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients with high neutralizing antibody might also be beneficial in the treatment of severe disease. SUMMARY: Early effective antiviral therapy in COVID-19 patients will suppress the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroid and convalescent plasma might further ameliorate the cytokine response.

{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 infection among children: Pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that may lead to respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Neonates and children are most vulnerable population to COVID-19 infection; however, the infection is usually milder and has a better prognosis in pediatric patients compared with adults. It remains unclear why pediatric population is less symptomatic than adults. Children frequently experience respiratory infections and their immune system is in developing stage. However, large proportion of the asymptomatic pediatric population may contribute to transmission. This review explores several aspects of COVID-19 infection such as its epidemiology, its molecular pathogenesis with respect to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and inflammatory mediators, intrauterine vertical transmission, imaging findings, and complications like cytokine release syndrome (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). We also looked at prognostic factors and treatment modalities like corticosteroids, RNA replicate inhibitors, protease inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that is, acalabrutinib and convalescent plasma therapy. Since there is no strong evidence for the intrauterine transmission, early isolation should be performed to protect a neonate from a COVID-19 infected mother.

The pandemic of COVID-19 presented an enormous challenge to the medical world in terms of diagnosis, treatment and health-care management as well as service organisation and provision. This novel virus and its spread affected every aspect of modern medical practice, ranging from investigating transmission of this new pathogen, antigen testing of symptomatic patients, imaging, assessing different treatment regimens and the production of a new vaccine. Imaging played a crucial role in the diagnosis of COVID-19-related lung disease, with plain radiography and CT being the main diagnostic modalities, with ultrasound a useful bedside imaging tool. The accurate and early diagnosis of the disease was not the only issue faced by Radiology Departments across the world; prevention of nosocomial infection, creating capacity with elective imaging suspension, management and protection of the workforce being few of the numerous challenges. The purpose of this manuscript is to present the steps that the Radiology Department of a large urban tertiary facility with a local vulnerable population, undertook to adapt the imaging service and structure, both initially escalating and then de-escalating a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Dendritic cells in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis: insights for a possible role in determining disease outcome. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This novel coronavirus emerged in China, quickly spreading to more than 200 countries worldwide. Although most patients are only mildly ill or even asymptomatic, some develop severe pneumonia and become critically ill. One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an unprecedented challenge to global public health. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in over 40 million cases and associated with 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Current management strategies for COVID-19 are largely supportive, and while there are more than 2000 interventional clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine (clinicaltrials.gov), results that can clarify benefits and risks of candidate therapies are only gradually becoming available. We herein describe recent advances in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets that are involved in viral entry into host cells, viral spread in the body, and the subsequent COVID-19 progression. We highlight two major lines of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment: 1) repurposing the existing drugs for use in COVID-19 patients, such as antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) and immunomodulators (e.g., dexamethasone) which were previously approved for other disease conditions, and 2) novel biological products that are designed to target specific molecules that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, such as REGN-COV2 (an antibody cocktail), as well as recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein to counteract SARS-CoV-2 binding to the transmembrane ACE2 receptor in target cells.

{"text": "The Psychosocial Implications on Cancer Patients: The Hidden Collateral of the War on Coronavirus Disease 2019. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has evolved into a pandemic of unheard proportions. Given the havoc wreaked by this pathogen worldwide, many countries have adopted an extreme, legally enforced method of social distancing, in the form of a lockdown. Unless appropriate preventive steps are taken, the cost of the pandemic and ensuing lockdown may prove to be irreparable. The evident implications of this lockdown, such as the escalating levels of unemployment, impending economic collapse, and severe food shortage faced by the sudden unemployed migrant labor population, have been widely reported. Cancer patients are a particularly vulnerable group even during nonpandemic times, often presenting late in the course of their disease, without the resources needed to avail recommended treatment. The prevalence of psychiatric complications and emotional distress is significantly higher than in the general population, and the trauma of both the pandemic and subsequent lockdown adds significantly to their mental trauma.

{"text": "The wide spectrum of Kawasaki-like disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Introduction: On June 2020, the first case of concurrent Covid-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) was published. After this first description, further works reported new cases of children affected by KD and KD-like syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical and biochemical features of these patients differed from the historical cohorts of KD, suggesting the possibility of a new multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome. Is still unclear if this new clinical entity, often referred as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), could be considered as part of the KD spectrum or is a new disease with different pathogenic mechanisms and uniquely linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors searched the available literature in MedLine (via Pubmed) with the terms (\"coronaviruses\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"Kawasaki disease\") for English studies without any temporal limit. Areas covered: This review aims to comprehensively describe multisystem inflammatory syndromes affecting children during Coronaviruses outbreak, and to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of human Coronaviridae in KD and KD-like syndromes. Expert opinion: An increased incidence of PIMS-TS, during the Covid-19 pandemic has been reported, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a severe hyper-inflammatory syndrome in childhood. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease are still unclear. Based on these findings, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered another trigger in the complex mosaic about the relationship among infectious agents and the occurrence of systemic hyper-inflammation related syndromes.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Cardiovascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The cardiac implications of Covid-19 are variable. Here we describe a gentleman with Covid-19 induced myocarditis with resultant atrial fibrillation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39 year-old male with no past medical history presented to the hospital with fevers and lower extremity swelling that started 7 days prior. In the ED an EKG revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR, while a TTE showed newly reduced EF of 10%. An infectious workup was conducted and positive for Covid-19. Inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP were found to be significantly elevated, along with mildly elevated troponin T which remained flat. Other etiologies of heart failure such as valvular disease, thyroid disorders, etc. were ruled out. Coronary angiography was deferred as suspicion for ACS remained low. It was noted that the patient's heart rate began to normalize as the fevers improved and the markers of inflammation decreased. Cardiac MRI was performed which revealed late gadolinium enhancement involving the subepicardium, consistent with myocardial injury and a diagnosis of myocarditis. Prior to discharge, the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm and repeat bedside echocardiogram suggested moderate improvement in ejection fraction. Patient was discharged medically stable with a repeat TTE scheduled to be performed in three months. DISCUSSION: The patient was suspected to have Covid-19 induced myocarditis leading to atrial fibrillation. Acute myocarditis is supported by new onset heart failure developing over the course of three months or less. It is further characterized by symptom onset following a GI or respiratory infection and/or dysrhythmias. This patient's cardiomyopathy occurred during the acute phase of a Covid-19 infection. Other typical etiologies of viral myocarditis such as coxsackie B were ruled out via negative respiratory viral panel and serologic titers. While there is limited knowledge on Covid-19 induced myocarditis, the presumed mechanism is thought to be secondary to direct viral damage and cytokine expression. Furthermore, these cytokines, including CRP and IL-6, produce oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that leads to cardiac remodeling precipitating atrial fibrillation. This patient's dysrhythmia was noted to improve as inflammatory markers improved. While myocarditis was considered to be the precipitant of this patient's cardiomyopathy-induced atrial fibrillation, the severely elevated inflammatory markers were presumed to play a secondary role. CONCLUSION(S): The importance of this case highlights the severe cardiac manifestations of the novel SARS-COV-2 virus. With continued research and awareness, it is reasonable for clinicians to include Covid-19 on the differential for viral myocarditis.

SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: There are no published studies concerning the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resident in high altitude. We aim to analyze the unique cohort and investigated the relationship among the patients resident in different altitude areas of Sichuan province, China. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical data including clinical features, imaging findings, laboratory characteristics and received treatment of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in Sichuan province from Jan 12th to March 12th, 2020. Outcomes were also compared between patients from high-altitude and non-high-altitude area. RESULT(S): 537 patients were included in this study, 78 were from high-altitude area and 459 from non-high-altitude area. The high-altitude area group was less likely had a clear travel history of Wuhan (9.0% vs. 64.3%, p<0.001) or contact with people from Wuhan (10.3% vs. 25.5%, p=0.003) within recent two weeks, but more likely contact with people infected of COVID-19 never been to Wuhan (60.3% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001) or of unknown origin (20.5% vs.7.0%, p<0.001). The high-altitude area group was more likely asymptomatic before admission (50.6% vs. 8.7%, p<0.001). Less patients with cough, sputum production and fever in the cohort comparing with those in non-high-altitude area. Lower body temperature, slower heart rate, and lower blood pressure relatively on admission were also found in high-altitude patients as well. The period from onset of illness to visit was 3 days (range, 1-7 days) and to diagnosis was 4 days (range,1-7 days), which were both significantly shorter in the group of high-altitude area. The patients from high-altitude had significantly higher lymphocyte count, lower platelet count and lower level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p all<0.05). Less patients with abnormally elevated C-reactive protein were also observed in high-altitude group (p<0.05). The most common patterns seen in these population on chest CT were bilateral distribution, ground-glass opacity, and consolidation and nodules. Multifocal distribution and consolidation were noted and showed significant in high-altitude patients. The proportion of patients with mild illness was significantly higher in the high-altitude area group (16[20.5%] vs. 33[7.2%], p<0.001). More likely to receiving antiviral and glucocorticoid therapies and less likely to receiving antibiotic drugs were shown in the patients in high-altitude area. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age, gender, diabetes and recent travel history of Wuhan were predictors of severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION(S): The disease severity of COVID-19 in Sichuan province was milder than Wuhan. More patients in high-altitude area were asymptomatic. It could owe to the active prevention, early detection and timely treatment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Active prevention, early detection and timely treatment is critical in COVID-19.

Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a major challenge all over the world, without acknowledged treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended to treat critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in a few reviews, but the clinical study evidence on its efficacy in COVID-19 patients was lacking., Methods: 325 patients with laboratory-confirmed critical COVID-19 were enrolled from 4 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centres in southern China from December 2019 to March 2020. The primary outcomes were 28- and 60-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing., Results: In the enrolled 325 patients, 174 cases used IVIG and 151 cases did not. The 28-day mortality was improved with IVIG after adjusting confounding in overall cohort (P = 0.0014), and the in-hospital and the total duration of disease were longer in the IVIG group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28-day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all P < 0.05); the application of IVIG in the early stage (admission <= 7 days) with a high dose (> 15 g per day) exhibited significant reduction in 60-day mortality in the critical-type patients., Conclusion: Early administration of IVIG with high dose improves the prognosis of critical-type patients with COVID-19. This study provides important information on clinical application of IVIG in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including patient selection and administration dosage and timing.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a striking 21st century pandemic. Communities across the globe have experienced significant infection rates and widespread psychosocial stress and trauma, leading to calls for increased allocation of resources for mental health screening and treatment. In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades. We discuss the current understanding of the possible neurotropism and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and relate this to the history of viral pandemics to better understand the relationship of viral infection, aberrant immune response and neurodevelopment, and the risk for schizophrenia disorder.

{"text": "Humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; implications in pathogenesis and protective immunity. The magnitude and the quality of humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with clinical outcome. Although the elicitation of humoral responses against different viral proteins is rapid and occurs in most infected individuals, its magnitude is highly variable among them and positively correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. This rapid response is characterized by the almost concomitant appearance of virus-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies that contain neutralizing antibodies directed against different epitopes of the Spike glycoprotein. Of particularly interest, the antibodies against domain of the Spike that interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD), are present in most infected individuals and are block viral entry and infectivity. Such neutralizing antibodies protect different animal species when administered before virus exposure; therefore, its elicitation is the main target of current vaccine approaches and their clinical use as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being explored. Yet, little information exists on the duration of humoral responses during natural infection. This is a key issue that will impact the management of the pandemic and determine the utility of seroconversion studies and the level of herd immunity. Certainly, several cases of reinfection have been reported, suggesting that immunity could be transient, as reported for other coronaviruses. In summary, although the kinetics of the generation of antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 and their protective activity have been clearly defined, their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the length of these responses are still open questions.

{"text": "Seasonal incidence of respiratory viral infections in Telangana, India: utility of a multiplex PCR assay to bridge the knowledge gap. Objective: The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. Method(s): A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. Result(s): Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. Conclusion(s): There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritised and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.Copyright \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Safety and Immunogenicity of Two RNA-Based Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States. METHOD(S): In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 mug, 20 mug, 30 mug, and 100 mug). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 mug of BNT162b1), participants received one dose. RESULT(S): A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples. CONCLUSION(S): The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2-3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

{"text": "Longitudinal Analysis of T and B Cell Receptor Repertoire Transcripts Reveal Dynamic Immune Response in COVID-19 Patients. Severe COVID-19 is associated with profound lymphopenia and an elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. We applied a novel dimer avoidance multiplexed polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing assay to analyze T (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires. Surprisingly, TCR repertoires were markedly diminished during the early onset of severe disease but recovered during the convalescent stage. Monitoring TCR repertoires could serve as an indicative biomarker to predict disease progression and recovery. Panoramic concurrent assessment of BCR repertoires demonstrated isotype switching and a transient but dramatic early IgA expansion. Dominant B cell clonal expansion with decreased diversity occurred following recovery from infection. Profound changes in T cell homeostasis raise critical questions about the early events in COVID-19 infection and demonstrate that immune repertoire analysis is a promising method for evaluating emergent host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, with great implications for assessing vaccination and other immunological therapies.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Niu, Li, Li, Pan, Wang, Feng, Mo, Yan, Ye, Luo, Qu, Weber, Byrne-Steele, Wang, Yu, Li, Myers, Lotze, Zhong, Han and Chen.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), often treated with immunosuppressive therapies, are still unknown., METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study among all French expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders. Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and June 30th , 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity score assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7 (death)., RESULTS: Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3] years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3%) were hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or azathioprine (3). They were younger (mean [SD] age: 37.0 [13.4] years), with a longer disease duration (mean [SD]: 8.3 [6.3] years) and had a lower EDSS score (median [range] EDSS: 2.5 [0-4]) relative to patients requiring hospitalization (mean [SD] age: 44.0 [16.4] years, mean [SD] disease duration: 5.8 [5.5] years, median [range] EDSS: 4 [0-6.5])., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcome was overall favorable in this cohort. Larger international studies are needed to identify risk factors of severe COVID-19, however we recommend personal protective measures to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this immunocompromised population.

Objectives: We assessed whether lockdown had a disproportionate impact on physical activity behavior in groups who were, or who perceived themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. Methods: Physical activity intensity (none, mild, moderate, or vigorous) before and during the UK COVID-19 lockdown was self-reported by 9,190 adults between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Physician-diagnosed health conditions and topic composition of open-ended text on participants' coping strategies were tested for associations with changes in physical activity. Results: Most (63.9%) participants maintained their normal physical activity intensity during lockdown, 25.0% changed toward less intensive activity and 11.1% were doing more. Doing less intensive physical activity was associated with obesity (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.42), hypertension (OR 1.25, 1.10-1.40), lung disease (OR 1.23, 1.08-1.38), depression (OR 2.05, 1.89-2.21), and disability (OR 2.13, 1.87-2.39). Being female (OR 1.25, 1.12-1.38), living alone (OR 1.20, 1.05-1.34), or without access to a garden (OR 1.74, 1.56-1.91) were also associated with doing less intensive physical activity, but being in the highest income group (OR 1.73, 1.37-2.09) or having school-age children (OR 1.29, 1.10-1.49) were associated with doing more. Younger adults were more likely to change their PA behavior compared to older adults. Structural topic modeling of narratives on coping strategies revealed associations between changes in physical activity and perceptions of personal or familial risks at work or at home. Conclusions: Policies on maintaining or improving physical activity intensity during lockdowns should consider (1) vulnerable groups of adults including those with chronic diseases or self-perceptions of being at risk and (2) the importance of access to green or open spaces in which to exercise.

{"text": "Complicating Infections Associated with Common Endemic Human Respiratory Coronaviruses. Coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are endemic human respiratory coronaviruses that typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory infections, similar to the common cold. They also may cause simple and complicated lower respiratory infections, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, gastroenteritis, and a few systemic complications. These viruses are usually seasonal (with winter dominance) and affect nearly all age groups. The seasonal and annual variation in virus prevalence has implications for understanding the concept of acquired immunity and its persistence or diminution. Coronaviruses generally have outbreak potential in susceptible populations of any age, particularly in patients with comorbidities, who tend to have increased clinical disease. These 4 coronaviruses are often found in the context of what appears to be coinfection with other pathogens, but especially other viruses. If coronaviruses are not specifically tested for, the sole detection of a viral copathogen would suggest the pathogen is the causative agent, when a coronavirus may be culpable, or both. The detection of these viruses in circumstances where respiratory viruses are generally sought in clinical samples is, therefore, justified. These pathogens can be chronically shed from the respiratory tract, which is more likely to occur among immunocompromised and complicated patients. These viruses share the potential for genetic drift. The genome is among the largest of RNA viruses, and the capability of these viruses to further change is likely underestimated. Given the potential disease among humans, it is justified to search for effective antiviral chemotherapy for these viruses and to consider uses in niche situations should effective therapy be defined. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 may follow the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV and extinguish slowly over time, there is yet concern that SARS-CoV-2 may establish itself as an endemic human respiratory coronavirus similar to OC43, 2299E, NL63, and HKU1. Until sufficient data are acquired to better understand the potential of SARS-CoV-2, continued work on antiviral therapy and vaccination is imperative.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

However, the impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here, we engineer the D614G mutation in the USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect. D614G enhances replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues through an improved infectivity of virions. Hamsters infected with the G614 variant produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, confirming clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. Sera from D614-infected hamsters exhibit modestly higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Another similarity amongst these infections is that bat is supposed to be primary reservoir for these viruses. 2019-nCoV was reported by WHO on 31 December 2020 which is spreading with alarming rate. WHO has considered this infection as pandemic which means that if the infection is misled then it will spread fear and will cause unnecessary suffering and death. The onset of infection shows general symptoms of flu which later on develops to pneumonia. The main challenge of the infection is that a defined vaccine or medicine is still under trial. Treatment is done on the basis of symptoms and recovery is dependent on the immune response of the patients.

{"text": "Effects of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on protein structures and intraviral protein-protein interactions. Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all >=1% as of September 1st, 2020, then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD >=5.0 A), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-S and Orf3a-Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations could change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby might have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between overweight and severity, drug response, and clinical outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed medical records of 240 COVID-19 patients admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between December 24, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Physical, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome data were abstracted. Patients who were obese [body mass index (BMI) >=28 kg/m], underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m), under 18 years old, pregnant, or still in hospital were excluded. Disease severity was classified as moderate or severe pneumonia based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. Overweight was defined as BMI >=24 kg/m and <28 kg/m. Patients were followed for discharge or death through April 10, 2020. We used logistic regression models to identify risk factors for severe disease, Cox proportional hazard models to explore associations between medications and patient outcomes (discharge or in-hospital death), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital death.One-half of patients (120, 50.0%) had severe pneumonia, while nearly one-half (114, 47.5%) were overweight. Among patients over 45 years old, overweight patients had significantly lower rates of fatigue, higher rates of headache, and higher median C-reactive protein levels. Patients under 45 years old had higher rates of cough and myalgia and higher proportions of increased alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase, as well as more pulmonary lobes involved in the pneumonia revealed by chest computed tomography scans. Overweight patients were at higher risk of developing severe pneumonia. Although weight was not a risk factor for in-hospital death, overweight patients showed different responses to medications compared with normal weight patients. Intravenous interferon-alpha, intravenous glucocorticoids, and antifungal drugs were associated with reduced mortality in overweight patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin, oseltamivir, and ribavirin were associated with reduced mortality in normal weight patients.Overweight is a worldwide health problem.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most hectic pandemic of the era, is increasing exponentially and taking thousands of lives worldwide. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity., Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found., Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69)., Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.

Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ+AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ+AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR=1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR=0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR=2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ+AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500ms (OR=1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.52-1.63), and mortality (OR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.43).

In this review, we aim to summarize available literature on the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in neonates and mothers and suggest a practical approach towards management of clinical scenarios. This review explores the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates born to mothers who were detected with the virus during the pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database of Systematic Review between November 2019 and June 2020 and screened articles related to perinatal COVID-19. This review included 786 mothers, among which 64% (504) were delivered by caesarian section. There were 3 still births and 107 (14%) were delivered preterm. Out of 793 neonates born, 629 neonates (79%) were tested after birth. The commonest symptom in neonates was respiratory distress. Respiratory support was needed in 60 neonates (7.6%), with 14 babies needing mechanical ventilation (1.8%), 25 needing non-invasive ventilation and 21 needing nasal oxygen. Only 35 of the 629 tested neonates (5.5%) were positive for COVID-19. Of the 35 positive neonates, 14 (40%) were symptomatic. The COVID-19 seems to have favourable neonatal outcomes. Majority of neonates are asymptomatic. Respiratory distress is the most common manifestation. What is known: *COVID-19 affects all ages. *Neonatal disease is usually mild. What is new: *Vertical transmission is a possible route of infection in neonates. *Breast milk and skin-to-skin contact are safe in COVID-19-infected mothers if performed with appropriate use of precautions such as hand and breast hygiene and masking.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

One report of SARS-CoV-2-associated familial GBS was found which affected a father and daughter of a family. Albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid was found in 80.8% of patients. The majority of patients (75.5%) had a demyelinating subtype of GBS. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis were given to 92.7% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. Around two-thirds (65.3%) of patients had a good outcome (GBS-disability score <= 2) on discharge from hospital. Two patients died in hospital., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS mostly resembles the classical presentations of GBS that respond to standard treatments. Extensive surveillance is required in low- and lower-middle-income countries to identify and report similar cases/series. Further large-scale case-control studies are warranted to strengthen the current evidence. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

{"text": "The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tuberculosis epidemic a modelling analysis. Background: Routine services for tuberculosis (TB) are being disrupted by stringent lockdowns against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. We sought to estimate the potential long-term epidemiological impact of such disruptions on TB burden in high-burden countries, and how this negative impact could be mitigated. Method(s): We adapted mathematical models of TB transmission in three high-burden countries (India, Kenya and Ukraine) to incorporate lockdown-associated disruptions in the TB care cascade. The anticipated level of disruption reflected consensus from a rapid expert consultation. We modelled the impact of these disruptions on TB incidence and mortality over the next five years, and also considered potential interventions to curtail this impact. Finding(s): Even temporary disruptions can cause long-term increases in TB incidence and mortality. If lockdown-related disruptions cause a temporary 50% reduction in TB transmission, we estimated that a 3-month suspension of TB services, followed by 10 months to restore to normal, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 119 million TB cases (Crl 106-133) and 361,000 TB deaths (CrI 333-394 thousand) in India, 24,700 (16,100-44,700) TB cases and 12,500 deaths (8.8-17.8 thousand) in Kenya, and 4,350 (826-6,540) cases and 1,340 deaths (815-1,980) in Ukraine. The principal driver of these adverse impacts is the accumulation of undetected TB during a lockdown. We demonstrate how long term increases in TB burden could be averted in the short term through supplementary \"catch-up\" TB case detection and treatment, once restrictions are eased. Interpretation(s): Lockdown-related disruptions can cause long-lasting increases in TB burden, but these negative effects can be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services, and targeted interventions that are implemented as soon as restrictions are lifted.

{"text": "Markov state modeling reveals alternative unbinding pathways for peptide-MHC complexes. Peptide binding to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) is a central component of the immune system, and understanding the mechanism behind stable peptide-MHC binding will aid the development of immunotherapies. While MHC binding is mostly influenced by the identity of the so-called anchor positions of the peptide, secondary interactions from nonanchor positions are known to play a role in complex stability. However, current MHC-binding prediction methods lack an analysis of the major conformational states and might underestimate the impact of secondary interactions. In this work, we present an atomically detailed analysis of peptide-MHC binding that can reveal the contributions of any interaction toward stability. We propose a simulation framework that uses both umbrella sampling and adaptive sampling to generate a Markov state model (MSM) for a coronavirus-derived peptide (QFKDNVILL), bound to one of the most prevalent MHC receptors in humans (HLA-A24:02). While our model reaffirms the importance of the anchor positions of the peptide in establishing stable interactions, our model also reveals the underestimated importance of position 4 (p4), a nonanchor position. We confirmed our results by simulating the impact of specific peptide mutations and validated these predictions through competitive binding assays. By comparing the MSM of the wild-type system with those of the D4A and D4P mutations, our modeling reveals stark differences in unbinding pathways. The analysis presented here can be applied to any peptide-MHC complex of interest with a structural model as input, representing an important step toward comprehensive modeling of the MHC class I pathway.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The world at large has been confronted with several disease outbreak which has posed and still posing a serious menace to public health globally. Recently, COVID-19 a new kind of coronavirus emerge from Wuhan city in China and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. There has been a reported case of about 8622985 with global death of 457,355 as of 15.05 GMT, June 19, 2020. South-Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Ghana are the most affected African countries with this outbreak. Thus, there is a need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence in this region for effective control and management. Different statistical tools and time series model such as the linear regression model and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been applied for disease prevalence/incidence prediction in different diseases outbreak. However, in this study, we adopted the ARIMA model to forecast the trend of COVID-19 prevalence in the aforementioned African countries. The datasets examined in this analysis spanned from February 21, 2020, to June 16, 2020, and was extracted from the World Health Organization website. ARIMA models with minimum Akaike information criterion correction (AICc) and statistically significant parameters were selected as the best models. Accordingly, the ARIMA (0,2,3), ARIMA (0,1,1), ARIMA (3,1,0) and ARIMA (0,1,2) models were chosen as the best models for SA, Nigeria, and Ghana and Egypt, respectively. Forecasting was made based on the best models. It is noteworthy to claim that the ARIMA models are appropriate for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19. We noticed a form of exponential growth in the trend of this virus in Africa in the days to come. Thus, the government and health authorities should pay attention to the pattern of COVID-19 in Africa. Necessary plans and precautions should be put in place to curb this pandemic in Africa.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) on March 02, 2020, Saudi Arabia has not reported quite a rapid COVD-19 spread as seen in America and many European countries. Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, a susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model was formulated, and a basic analysis of the model is presented including model positivity, boundedness, and stability around the disease-free equilibrium. It is found that the model is locally and globally stable around the disease-free equilibrium when R0 < 1. The model parameterized from COVID-19 confirmed cases reported by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia (MOH) from March 02 till April 14, while some parameters are estimated from the literature. The numerical simulation showed that the model predicted infected curve is in good agreement with the real data of COVID-19-infected cases.

{"text": "Decoding Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection and Transmission. One of the major challenges in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is its asymptomatic transmission. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. On the basis of the genotyping of 75775 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation (i.e., L37F at nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6)). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Artificial intelligence, sequence alignment, and network analysis are applied to show that NSP6 mutation L37F may have compromised the virus's ability to undermine the innate cellular defense against viral infection via autophagy regulation. This assessment is in good agreement with our genotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The World Health Organization declared that the total number of confirmed cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, affecting 210 countries, exceeded 3 million on 29 April 2020, with more than 207,973 deaths. In order to end the global COVID-19 pandemic, public authorities have put in place multiple strategies like testing, contact tracing, and social distancing. Predictive mathematical models for epidemics are fundamental to understand the development of the epidemic and to plan effective control strategies. Some hosts may carry SARS-CoV-2 and transmit it to others, yet display no symptoms themselves. We propose applying a model (SELIAHRD) taking in consideration the number of asymptomatic infected people. The SELIAHRD model consists of eight stages: Susceptible, Exposed, Latent, Symptomatic Infected, Asymptomatic Infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, and Dead. The asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of disease, but go largely undetected and can therefore undermine efforts to control transmission. The simulation of possible scenarios of the implementation of social distancing shows that if we rigorously follow the social distancing rule then the healthcare system will not be overloaded.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which is most frequently mild yet can be severe and life-threatening. Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization., METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here., RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was -3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was -0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.98 to -0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group., CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of three doses of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11.

We aimed to conduct a multidimensional analysis of risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes., METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 1443 patients with COVID-19, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 with and without diabetes. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. The 84-day survival duration for critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who had different levels of leukocytes and neutrophils, or treated with immunoglobulin or not, was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves., RESULTS: Of the 1443 patients with COVID-19, 256 (17.7%) had diabetes, had a median age of 66.0 [IQR 58.0-73.8] years, and were more likely to develop severe (41.8% vs. 35.6%) and critical disease (34.0% vs. 14.9%), followed by higher mortality (21.1% vs. 7.0%), than those without diabetes. Higher levels of leukocytes (> 5.37 x 109/L), older age, and comorbid cerebrovascular disease and chronic renal disease independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. Leukocytes > 5.37 x 109/L and the application of immunoglobulin were associated with shorter survival duration and lower mortality, respectively, in critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes., CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19 and diabetes, especially when they have high leukocyte counts (> 5.37 x 109/L).

{"text": "The estimated impact of decreased childhood vaccination due to COVID-19 using a dynamic transmission model of mumps in Japan. The exact impact of the decline in childhood vaccination coverage during COVID-19 outbreak has not been estimated for any vaccine-preventable diseases. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased mumps vaccination due to COVID-19 on the disease burden of mumps in Japan. Using a previously validated dynamic transmission model of mumps infection in Japan, the incidence rate of mumps over the next 30 y since July 2020 was estimated. The estimated average incidences were 269.1, 302.0, and 455.4/100,000 person-years in rapid recovery, slow recovery, and permanent decline scenarios. Compared with the rapid recovery scenario, the incremental number of mumps cases, total costs, and QALYs loss over the next 30 y were 6.53 million cases, 2.63 billion USD, and 49,246 for the permanent decline scenario, respectively. In conclusion, the persistent decline of mumps vaccination rate as an impact of COVID-19 causes a significant incremental disease burden of mumps, which is consistent irrespective of the possible decline of transmission rate of mumps infection, unless the rapid recovery of coverage rate is achieved. The immediate measures to advocate the vaccination program is essential to mitigate the incremental disease burden in the COVID-19 period.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Maintaining safe elective surgical activity during the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging and it is not clear how COVID-19 may impact peri-operative morbidity and mortality in this population. Therefore, adaptations to normal care pathways are required. Here, we establish if implementation of a bespoke peri-operative care bundle for urgent elective surgery during a pandemic surge period can deliver a low COVID-19-associated complication profile. We present a single-centre retrospective cohort study from a tertiary care hospital of patients planned for urgent elective surgery during the initial COVID-19 surge in the UK between 29 March and 12 June 2020. Patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 were screened by oronasal swab and chest imaging (chest X-ray or computed tomography if aged >= 18 years), proceeding to surgery if negative. COVID-19 positive patients at screening were delayed. Postoperatively, patients transitioning to COVID-19 positive status by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing were identified by an in-house tracking system and monitored for complications and death within 30 days of surgery. Out of 557 patients referred for surgery (230 (41.3%) women; median (IQR [range]) age 61 (48-72 [1-89])), 535 patients (96%) had COVID-19 screening, of which 13 were positive (2.4%, 95%CI 1.4-4.1%). Out of 512 patients subsequently undergoing surgery, 7 (1.4%) developed COVID-19 positive status (1.4%, 95%CI 0.7-2.8%) with one COVID-19-related death (0.2%, 95%CI 0.0-1.1%) within 30 days. Out of these seven patients, four developed pneumonia, of which two required invasive ventilation including one patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Low rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality in the elective surgical population can be achieved within a targeted care bundle.

The aim of this study was finding the appropriate conditions for the expression of reluctant proteins that is the human neutral amino acid transporters ASCT2 and B0AT1, that have great relevance to human health in cancer therapy and in COVID-19 research, respectively. The cDNAs coding for the proteins of interest were cloned in the pCOLD I vector and different E. coli strains (BL21 codon plus RIL, and RosettaGami2) were cultured in absence or in presence of glucose (0.5-1%), at low temperature (15 degreeC), and low inducer concentrations (10-100 microM). Cell growth and protein production were monitored by optical density measurements and western blotting assay, respectively. Even though in different conditions, the expression of both amino acid transporters was obtained.Reducing the growth rate of specific E. coli strains by lowering the temperature and the IPTG concentration, together with the addition of glucose, two reluctant human neutral amino acid transporters have been expressed in E. coli.

We evaluated incidence and clinical features of GBS in a cohort of patients from two regions of northern Italy with the highest number of patients with COVID-19., METHODS: GBS cases diagnosed in 12 referral hospitals from Lombardy and Veneto in March and April 2020 were retrospectively collected. As a control population, GBS diagnosed in March and April 2019 in the same hospitals were considered., RESULTS: Incidence of GBS in March and April 2020 was 0.202/100 000/month (estimated rate 2.43/100 000/year) vs 0.077/100 000/month (estimated rate 0.93/100 000/year) in the same months of 2019 with a 2.6-fold increase. Estimated incidence of GBS in COVID-19-positive patients was 47.9/100 000 and in the COVID-19-positive hospitalised patients was 236/100 000. COVID-19-positive patients with GBS, when compared with COVID-19-negative subjects, showed lower MRC sum score (26.3+/-18.3 vs 41.4+/-14.8, p=0.006), higher frequency of demyelinating subtype (76.6% vs 35.3%, p=0.011), more frequent low blood pressure (50% vs 11.8%, p=0.017) and higher rate of admission to intensive care unit (66.6% vs 17.6%, p=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an increased incidence of GBS during the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy, supporting a pathogenic link.

Compared to individuals who experienced a stroke without the infection, patients with COVID-19 and stroke were younger (pooled median difference=-6.0 years; 95%CI:-12.3 to -1.4), had higher NIHSS (pooled median difference=5; 95%CI:3-9), higher frequency of large vessel occlusion (OR=2.73; 95%CI:1.63-4.57), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR=5.21; 95% CI:3.43-7.90)., CONCLUSIONS: Acute CVD is not uncommon in COVID-19, especially in those whom are severely infected and have pre-existing vascular risk factors. The pattern of large vessel occlusion and multi-territory infarcts suggest that cerebral thrombosis and/or thromboembolism could be possible causative pathways for the disease.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A retrospective observational study was performed, with data collected from the Portuguese's National Registry of Cardiac Arrests (OHCA records) between the 1st of March and the 31st of May of 2020 compared with the homologous period of 2019. During the referred period were registered in 2020 a total of 4673 cases of OHCA, 11% more than in 2019 during the same period (n = 4201). No gender or age differences were found between the two samples. OHCA happened more frequently at home (77.30% vs. 73.96%), with a decrease in public places (6.24% vs. 4.60%). No difference was found between nursery homes (13.28% vs. 13.08%) or other undefined places (6.52% vs. 5.03%). The cause of OHCA showed no major differences concerning cardiac (48.92% vs. 49.41%), respiratory (4.78% vs. 4.39%) and other undefined causes (42.23% vs. 43.55%), nevertheless there was a reduction in traumatic OHCA (4.07% vs. 2.67%). Life support manoeuvres were performed in 74.93% of the OCHA cases in 2020, 6.17% less than in 2019 (68.76%). From these, ROSC (Return Of Spontaneous Circulation) was obtained in fewer cases in 2020 than in 2019 (8.45% vs. 4.17%).

{"text": "COVID-19 Vaccines on Clinical Trials and their Mode of Action for Immunity against the Virus. For nearly two decades, coronaviruses have caused many health and economic problems, while no effective commercial vaccine has yet been developed. It is worth mentioning that despite some mutations and recombination in SARS-CoV-2, its genotype is very close to the original strain from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be promising. It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement is may threaten vaccinated people's lives and long-term side effect must be considered. To this end, targeting of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) in spike and not whole spike, glycolization of FC receptors, PD-1 blockers, CPPs, etc. are promising. Therefore, the subunit vaccines or RNA vaccines that encode the RBP segment of the spike are of interest. To enhance the vaccine efficacy, its co-delivery with an adjuvant has been recommended. Nanoparticles modulate immune response with higher efficiency than the soluble form of antigens and can be functionalized with the positively charged moieties and ligands of targeted cells, such as dendritic cells, to increase cellular uptake of the antigens and their presentation on the surface of immune cells. This research aimed to discuss the COVID-19 vaccines entering the clinical trial and their mode of action effective immunity against the virus and discusses their advantages compared to each other.

{"text": "A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence. Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will likely require the rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals on an ongoing basis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, since sample dilution increases the likelihood of false negatives for individuals with low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Likewise, minimising the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimising the time testing takes to reduce the spread of infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests and rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (cf. 30-fold to 48-fold dilution in Refs. 9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor which, furthermore, increases as the prevalence falls. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to closely and continually monitor infection in a population, along with rapid and effective isolation of infected people, provides a promising pathway to the longterm control of COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Diabetes has been found to increase severity and mortality under the current pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Up to date, the clinical characteristics of diabetes patients with COVID-19 and the risk factors for poor clinical outcomes are not clearly understood. Methods: The study was retrospectively carried out on enrolled diabetes patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection from a designated medical center for COVID-19 from January 25th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The medical record was collected and reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with the severe events which were defined as a composite endpoint of admission to intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: A total of 52 diabetes patients with COVID-19 were finally included in the study. 21 (40.4%) patients had developed severe events in 27.50 (IQR 12.25-35.75) days follow-up, 15 (28.8%) patients experienced life-threatening complications and 8 patients died with a recorded mortality rate of 15.4%. Only 13 patients (41.9%) were in optimal glycemic control with HbA1c value of <7.0%. In addition to general clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the severe events diabetes patients showed higher counts of white blood cells and neutrophil, lower lymphocytes (40, 76.9%), high levels of hs-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (PCT) as compared to the non-severe diabetes patients. Mild higher level of cardiac troponin I (cTNI) (32.0 pg/ml; IQR 16.80-55.00) and D-dimer (1.70 mug/L, IQR 0.70-2.40) were found in diabetes patients with severe events as compared to the non-severe patients (cTNI:20.00 pg/ml, IQR5.38-30.00, p = 0.019; D-dimer: 0.70 mug/L, IQR 0.30-2.40, p = 0.037). After adjusting age and sex, increased level of cTNI was found to significantly associate with the incidence of severe events (HR: 1.007; 95% CI: 1.000-1.013; p = 0.048), Furthermore, using of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors was found to be the potential protectant for severe events (HR: 0.227; 95% CI: 0.057-0.904; p = 0.035). Conclusion:  Diabetes patients with COVID-19 showed poor clinical outcomes. Vigorous monitoring of cTNI should be recommended for the diabetes patients with COVID-19.

{"text": "Small molecule therapeutics for COVID-19: Repurposing of inhaled furosemide. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health concern. The morbidity and mortality of the potentially lethal infection caused by this virus arise from the initial viral infection and the subsequent host inflammatory response. The latter may lead to excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as TNF-a ultimately culminating in hypercytokinemia (\"cytokine storm\"). To address this immuno-inflammatory pathogenesis, multiple clinical trials have been proposed to evaluate anti-inflammatory biologic therapies targeting specific cytokines. However, despite the obvious clinical utility of such biologics, their specific applicability to COVID-19 has multiple drawbacks, including they target only one of the multiple cytokines involved in COVID-19's immunopathy. Therefore, we set out to identify a small molecule with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory mechanism of action targeting multiple cytokines of innate immunity. In this study, a library of small molecules endogenous to the human body was assembled, subjected to in silico molecular docking simulations and a focused in vitro screen to identify anti-pro-inflammatory activity via interleukin inhibition. This has enabled us to identify the loop diuretic furosemide as a candidate molecule. To pre-clinically evaluate furosemide as a putative COVID-19 therapeutic, we studied its anti-inflammatory activity on RAW264.7, THP-1 and SIM-A9 cell lines stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon treatment with furosemide, LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was reduced, indicating that furosemide suppresses the M1 polarization, including IL-6 and TNF-a release. In addition, we found that furosemide promotes the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine products (IL-1RA, arginase), indicating M2 polarization. Accordingly, we conclude that furosemide is a reasonably potent inhibitor of IL-6 and TNF-a that is also safe, inexpensive and well-studied. Our pre-clinical data suggest that it may be a candidate for repurposing as an inhaled therapy against COVID-19.Copyright 2020 Wang et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We characterized geographic and temporal variations in AKI rates and estimated variance explained by key variables utilizing Poisson regressions., RESULTS: In total, 1655 (32%) participants had AKI; 961 (58%), 223 (13%), and 270 (16%) met Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions of stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI, respectively, and 201 (12%) received KRT. Eight percent of participants had AKI within 1 day of hospitalization, and 47% did not recover to baseline serum creatinine by discharge. Older age, Black race, male gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lower eGFR were significant predictors of AKI during hospitalization with COVID-19. AKI was associated with higher mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 6.46; 95% confidence interval, 5.52 to 7.57) and longer hospital stay (5.56 additional days; 95% confidence interval, 4.78 to 6.34).

The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes.

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is sweeping the world and posing serious health problems. Rapid and accurate detection along with timely isolation is the key to control the epidemic. Nucleic acid test and antibody-detection have been applied in the diagnosis of COVID-19, while both have their limitations. Comparatively, direct detection of viral antigens in clinical specimens is highly valuable for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the predominantly expressed proteins with high immunogenicity during the early stages of infection. Here, we applied multiple bioinformatics servers to forecast the potential immunodominant regions derived from the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since the high homology of N protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we attempted to leverage existing SARS-CoV immunological studies to develop SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic antibodies. Finally, N229-269, N349-399, and N405-419 were predicted to be the potential immunodominant regions, which contain both predicted linear B-cell epitopes and murine MHC class II binding epitopes.

Results The proportion of normal chest CT in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were 35.4% (17/48) and 3.3%(2/61), respectively (P 0.001). In 17 asymptomatic patients, their images of chest CT maintained normal during the whole course of diseases, while the normal images of chest CT in 2 pre-symptomatic patients progressed to abnormal later (P 0.001). All the six asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection maintained unilateral lesion, while the proportion was 29.4%(5/17) in pre-symptomatic patients(P= 0.003). Compared with asymptomatic patients, pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had worse levels of Lymphocyte count (P= 0.001), Albumin (P= 0.045), Aspartate aminotransferase (P= 0.044), gamma-glutamyl transpeptadase (P= 0.016), Globulin (P= 0.036), Creatinine (P= 0.021), Lactate dehydrogenase (P= 0.008), C-reactive protein (P 0.001), Serum amyloid A (P 0.001), and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P 0.001). Except for above indicators, Alkaline phosphatase (P= 0.009), Procalcitonin (P= 0.010), and D-dimer(P 0.001) increased further during periods of symptoms compared with those levels in pre-symptomatic period. Conclusion In early stage after SARS-CoV-2 infection, images of chest CT and blood tests of asymptomatic patients were different from pre-symptomatic patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "De novo design of potent and resilient hACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We developed a de novo protein design strategy to swiftly engineer decoys for neutralizing pathogens that exploit extracellular host proteins to infect the cell. Our pipeline allowed the design, validation, and optimization of de novo hACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The best decoy, CTC-445.2, binds with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity to the RBD of the spike protein. Cryo-EM shows that the design is accurate and can simultaneously bind to all three RBDs of a single spike protein. Because the decoy replicates the spike protein target interface in hACE2, it is intrinsically resilient to viral mutational escape. A bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, shows ~10-fold improvement in binding. CTC-445.2d potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells in vitro and a single intranasal prophylactic dose of decoy protected Syrian hamsters from a subsequent lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

{"text": "Enhanced Binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to Receptor by Distal Polybasic Cleavage Sites. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a crucial role in binding the human cell receptor ACE2 that is required for viral entry. Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild-type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "A Comprehensive Review on Sarilumab in COVID-19. Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread all around the world. Despite the emergency of COVID-19 worldwide, remdesivir is the only treatment that has been recently approved to treat the diseases, and other effective therapies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. Based on available data, there is an association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and severe COVID-19. Sarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody binding to both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors with high affinity and has been considered for off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19. Areas covered: The present article reviews recently published literature focusing on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, the potential therapeutic role, and important clinical issues of sarilumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: The off-label treatment administration is unavoidable in the critical situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further efforts should be directed to determine mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced immune dysregulation as well as indications of sarilumab in the patients with COVID-19 to minimize concerns regarding its off-label administration.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data on the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms in patients with cancer are limited. We sought to characterize the GI manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in oncology patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 9 Massachusetts medical centers and identified those with an active malignancy. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer., RESULTS: Of 395 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (9%) had an active malignancy. Of the 36 cancer patients, 23 (63%) reported >=1 new GI symptom. The most prevalent symptoms were anorexia (12, 52%), diarrhea (9, 39%), and vomiting (8, 35%). GI symptoms were the initial symptom in 4/36 (11%) patients, were the predominant symptom in 5/36 (14%) patients, and were severe in 4/23 (17%) patients. Four of 5 patients with GI symptoms at presentation reported concurrent fever; notably 1 patient had no fever or respiratory symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients had elevations in liver transaminases at presentation; patients with elevated transaminases were more likely to have associated GI symptoms (83% vs. 54%, P=0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Acute GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 are highly prevalent in hospitalized cancer patients and can occur as a presenting symptom without respiratory symptoms.

{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases: At the crossroads of thromboinflammation and autoimmunity. Inflammation and coagulation are key basic mechanism of protection against all potentially pathogenic mechanical and biological factors targeting human organism from inner and outer environment. On the other hand, uncontrolled inflammation results in hypercoagulation, inhibition of anticoagulation and alteration of mechanisms responsible for resolution of inflammation, while production of \"procoagulant\" mediators (thrombin, tissue factor and others), activation of platelets and of vascular endothelial cells maintains inflammation. All factors taken together serve as the basis for a pathological process called thromboinflammation or immunothrombosis. Currently thromboinflammation is considered in the broad sense as a universal pathogenetic mechanism of numerous widespread acute and chronic conditions, including immune-mediated (autoimmune) inflammatory rheumatic diseases, oftentimes complicated by severe irreversible damage to vital organs. Thromboinflammation gained specific attention during COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, caused by SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2). COVID-19 is considered currently as systemic thromboinflammation syndrome, manifesting via generalized thrombosis of arterial and venous macro- and microvasculature, termed as COVID-19-coagulopathy. The paper discusses common pathogenetic coagulopathy mechanisms in COVID-19 and immune-mediated (autoimmune) inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMRDs), associated with overproduction of antiphospholipid antibodies, activation of the complement system, and dis-regulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, etc. Delineating the autoimmune subtype of thromboinflammation, identification of genetic (i.e., genes encoding the complement system and others) and molecular-biologic biomarkers associated with higher occurrence of COVID-19-coagulopathy are the most relevant undertakings for the current practice. Gaining insights into mechanisms of thromboinflammation and converting them into potential pharmacotherapies of IMDs would facilitate and accelerate the drafting of effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Ima-Press Publishing House.

{"text": "Investigation of CD26, a potential SARS2-CoV-2 receptor, as a biomarker of age and pathology. OBJECTIVE: In some individuals, corona virus SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a variety of serious inflammatory symptoms, including blood clotting and acute respiratory distress. Death due to COVID-19 shows a steep rise in relation to age. Comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease also increase susceptibility. It has been reported that T-cell regulatory dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; CD26) binds to the external spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as a receptor, for the viral entry into the host cell. CD26 is expressed on many cells, including T and NK cells of the immune system, as a membrane-anchored form. A soluble form (sCD26) is also found in the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Approach and results: To investigate a possible relationship between soluble CD26 levels, age and pathology, serum samples were collected from control, T2DM and age-related dementia (ARD) subjects. A significant reduction of serum sCD26 levels was seen in relation to age. ARD and T2DM were also associated with lower levels of sCD26. The analysis of blood smears revealed different cellular morphologies: excessive sCD26 was found around the mononucleated cells. ARD subjects had abnormal fragmented platelets and haemolysis and low levels of sCD26., CONCLUSIONS: These findings may explain the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, high serum sCD26 levels may protect from viral infection by competively inhibiting the virus binding to cellular CD26, whereas low sCD26 levels could increase the risk of infection. Measuring serum sCD26 level may help to identify individuals at high risk for the COVID-19 infection. Copyright 2020 The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Many COVID-19 patients develop a hyperinflammatory response which activates blood coagulation and may contribute to the occurrence of thromboembolic complications. Blockade of interleukin-6, a key cytokine in COVID-19 pathogenesis, may improve the hypercoagulable state induced by inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor on coagulation parameters., METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed moderate to critical COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation, who received a single 324 mg subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab on top of standard of care were enrolled in this analysis. Coagulation parameters were measured before tocilizumab and at day 1, 3, and 7 after treatment. All patients were followed-up for 35 days after admission or until death., RESULTS: 70 patients (mean age 60 years, interquartile range 52-75) were included. Treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels (-56%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -68% to -44%), fibrinogen (-48%; 95%CI, -60% to -35%), C-reactive protein (-93%; 95%CI, -99% to -87%), prothrombin time (-4%; 95%CI,-9% to 0.8%), and activated thromboplastin time (-4%; 95%CI,-8.7% to 0.8%), and an increase in platelet count (34%; 95%CI, 23% to 45%). These changes occurred already one day after treatment with sustained reductions throughout day 7. The improvement in coagulation was consistently observed in patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose anticoagulants, and was paralleled by a rapid improvement in respiratory function., CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous tocilizumab was associated with significant improvement of blood coagulation parameters independently of thromboprophylaxis dose.

The characterization of cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental to understand COVID-19 progression and the development of immunological memory to the virus. In this study, we detected T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins M, S and N, as well as serum virus-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, in nearly all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but not in healthy donors. Virus-reactive T cells exhibited signs of in vivo activation, as suggested by the surface expression of immune-checkpoint molecules PD1 and TIGIT. Of note, we detected antigen-specific adaptive immune response both in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. More importantly, symptomatic patients displayed a significantly higher magnitude of both cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune response to the virus, as compared to asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that an uncontrolled adaptive immune response contribute to the development of the life threatening inflammatory phase of the disease.

Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis.

In March 2020, a multidisciplinary task force (so-called Basque Modelling Task Force, BMTF) was created to assist the Basque health managers and Government during the COVID-19 responses. BMTF is a modelling team, working on different approaches, including stochastic processes, statistical methods and artificial intelligence. Here we describe the efforts and challenges to develop a flexible modeling framework able to describe the dynamics observed for the tested positive cases, including the modelling development steps. The results obtained by a new stochastic SHARUCD model framework are presented. Our models differentiate mild and asymptomatic from severe infections prone to be hospitalized and were able to predict the course of the epidemic, providing important projections on the national health system's necessities during the increased population demand on hospital admissions. Short and longer-term predictions were tested with good results adjusted to the available epidemiological data. We have shown that the partial lockdown measures were effective and enough to slow down disease transmission in the Basque Country. The growth rate [Formula: see text] was calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. The analysis of the growth rates from the data led to improved model versions describing after the exponential phase also the new information obtained during the phase of response to the control measures.

BACK GROUND: Since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic many available drugs have been tried for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 with limited success or failure. The household direct contacts of the COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 in the view of its in-vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is still inconclusive and evolving., METHOD: In this open label control clinical trial asymptomatic individual who had direct contact with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in last 2 weeks were given the option for taking HCQ prophylaxis and assigned into PEP (N=132) and control groups (N=185). The PEP group received tablet HCQ 800 mg on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both the groups received standard care of therapy in the form of home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene and followed up for 4 weeks for new onset COVID-19., RESULTS: Total 50 out of 317 participants (15.8%) had new onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.033) lower in PEP group [N=14 out of 132, (10.6%)] as compared to the control group [N=36 out of 185, (19.4%)]. Total absolute risk reduction for the incidence of COVID-19 was -8.8% points. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent occurrence of one case of COVID-19 was 12. The overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 1.05). The compliance was good and most common ADR was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation, reported by 3 participants and no serious ADR was noted., CONCLUSION: PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Till definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals for the prevention of COVID-19, as endorsed by many national/international health authorities.

There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 >=28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only., CONCLUSIONS: Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown in England. IPD/COVID-19 confections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age distribution and serotype distribution of IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections does not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.

{"text": "Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and has caused traumatic experience for nurses worldwide. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses, and how psychosocial factors influence nurses in this public crisis are unknown., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020., METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively., RESULTS: The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that COVID-19-related stress, relationship quality with family, and demographic characteristics were associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived health status. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was similar between nurses working in low-risk COVID-19 wards was as high as working in high-risk COVID-19 wards (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 0.784-1.481)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 factors and psychosocial factors were associated with mental health of nurses. The results suggest that hospitals should implement effective mental health promotion programs focused on occupational safety and family support to improve the well-being of nurses.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to evaluate the impact of a stay-at-home order on stroke metrics during the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic., METHODS: Data on baseline characteristics, stroke subtype, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, the time between last known well (LKW) to emergency department (ED) arrival, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration, the involvement of large vessel occlusion (LVO), and whether mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was pursued in patients with acute stroke were extracted from 24 March to 23 April 2020 (the time period of a stay-at-home order was placed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the study group) at a tertiary care hospital in West Michigan, USA, compared with data from 24 March to 23 April 2019 (control group)., RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a reduction in cases of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although this did not reach statistical significance. However, there was an increase in hemorrhagic stroke (7.5% controls vs. 19.2% study group). The age of stroke patients was significantly younger during the period of the stay-at-home order compared to the control group. We identified a significant overall delay of ED arrivals from LKW in the study group. Additionally, an increased number of AIS patients with LVO in the study group (34.8%) was found compared to the control group (17.5%). A significantly increased number of patients received MT in the study group. Additionally, 11 patients were COVID-19 PCR-positive in the study group, 10 with AIS and only 1 with hemorrhagic stroke. Patients with COVID-19 had a high incidence of atrial fibrillation and hyperlipidemia. One AIS patient with COVID-19 rapidly developed cytotoxic edema with corresponding elevated inflammatory biomarkers. No statistical significance was noted when stroke subtype, LVO, and MT groups were compared., CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of decreasing AIS admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a significantly increased number of AIS patients with LVO who received MT, especially those with COVID-19. We conclude that cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in AIS patients with COVID-19. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

Assessing the effects of early non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 spread is crucial for understanding and planning future control measures to combat the pandemic. We use observations of reported infections and deaths, human mobility data, and a metapopulation transmission model to quantify changes in disease transmission rates in US counties from March 15 to May 3, 2020. We find that marked, asynchronous reductions of the basic reproductive number occurred throughout the US in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same measures been implemented 1-2 weeks earlier, substantial cases and deaths could have been averted, and that delayed responses to future increased incidence will facilitate a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive control in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the Spanish flu, now the world is in the grip of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First detected in 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite the initial evidence indicating a zoonotic origin, the contagion is now known to primarily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The precautionary measures recommended by the scientific community to halt the fast transmission of the disease failed to prevent this contagious disease from becoming a pandemic for a whole host of reasons. After an incubation period of about two days to two weeks, a spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in individuals afflicted by COVID-19: from an asymptomatic condition that can spread the virus in the environment, to a mild/moderate disease with cold/flu-like symptoms, to deteriorated conditions that need hospitalization and intensive care unit management, and then a fatal respiratory distress syndrome that becomes refractory to oxygenation. Several diagnostic modalities have been advocated and evaluated; however, in some cases, diagnosis is made on the clinical picture in order not to lose time. A consensus on what constitutes special treatment for COVID-19 has yet to emerge. Alongside conservative and supportive care, some potential drugs have been recommended and a considerable number of investigations are ongoing in this regard.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations: Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

{"text": "Of mice and men: The coronavirus mhv and mouse models as a translational approach to understand sars-cov-2. The fatal acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, infection and mortality rates have been rising steadily worldwide. The lack of a vaccine, as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies, emphasize the need to develop new strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis. Since mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 share a common genus, lessons learnt from MHV and SARS-CoV could offer mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we have focused on various aspects, including host species, organotropism, transmission, clinical disease, pathogenesis, control and therapy, MHV as a model for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as mouse models for infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans share various similarities, there are also differences that need to be addressed when studying murine models. Translational approaches, such as humanized mouse models are pivotal in studying the clinical course and pathology observed in COVID-19 patients. Lessons from prior murine studies on coronavirus, coupled with novel murine models could offer new promising avenues for treatment of COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

{"text": "Considerations for Pregnant Dental and Health Care Workers amid COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease that quickly reached pandemic levels. Over 5 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 330,000 deaths have been recorded worldwide. Transmission is primarily spread through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets, the mouth, and/or nose secretions. Health care professionals (HCPs), including dental HCPs, are recognized to be at considerably high risk for infection due to the close proximity to patients and aerosol-generating procedures. During pregnancy, HCPs may be at even higher risk since pregnancy substantially increases the susceptibility to infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE(S): Here, we present the posed risks and potential effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal health. Current prevention and management strategies for COVID-19 on pregnant dental and HCPs are also discussed. RESULT(S): Significant progress is being made in understanding the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of COVID-19. Pregnant women are affected more adversely with viral illnesses, although evidence of vertical transmission of COVID-19 is controversial. Based on the presence of atypical symptoms, the significant numbers of asymptomatic individuals who are COVID-19 positive, and the high susceptibility to viral diseases observed in pregnant women, recommendations have been put forth to limit the exposure of COVID-19-positive or even suspected cases to pregnant HCPs, and these are likely to evolve as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION(S): Pregnant HCPs require extra caution: not only are they considered a high-risk population, but their work at the frontline in a pandemic may expose them to additional risks. Complete awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on maternal and fetal/infant health, as well as prevention and management guidelines for pregnant HCPs, will allow for a safer work environment. Health care institutional policies aimed at protecting pregnant HCPs should consider avoiding their assignment as first responders, especially if equally trained staff are available. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Dental and health care professionals can use the information in this review to improve their awareness of COVID-19 risks, signs, and symptoms and the associated effects on the health of pregnant health care professionals and their unborn/newborn children.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease with a mortality of 9.56%. Although SARS is etiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and functional cell receptor has been identified, the pathogenesis of the virus infection is largely unclear. Method(s): The clinical specimens were processed and analyzed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in-house. Further investigations of target antigen included reviews of phage display technique, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, protein expression and purification, Western blotting validation, serological and immunohistochemical staining in postmortem tissue. Result(s): A type of medium or low titer anti-lung tissue antibodies were found in the sera of SARS patients at the early stage of the disease. Human long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) gene endonuclease (EN) domain protein was one of the target autoantigens and it was aberrantly expressed in the lung tissue of SARS patients. Anti-EN antibody was positive in the sera of 40.9% of SARS patients.

{"text": "Management of refractory skin lupus. Management of refractory skin lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus involves combinations of local measures and systemic agents requiring adjustment to activity and development of the disease. The treatment options are fairly similar for the different cutaneous manifestations; however, no drugs have been licensed specifically for the treatment of skin lesions in this disease. Therefore, the aim of the European guideline was to achieve a broad consensus on treatment strategies for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) by a European subcommittee, guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and supported by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV). Standard treatment of CLE includes preventive measures such as smoking cessation and photoprotection. Ultraviolet (UV) A and B light is one of the most important risk factors for CLE, clearly documented by photoprovocation studies in large patient cohorts. In the past years, several trials have been performed to investigate the preventive effect of sunscreens in patients with UV-induced CLE. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that the application of a broadspectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor prevents UVinduced skin lesions under standardised conditions. First-line treatment options in CLE include topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Currently available topical calcineurin inhibitors (0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, 1% pimecrolimus cream) have been licensed for the use in patients with atopic dermatitis. The major advantage of these agents is their better safety profile when compared to topical corticosteroids. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial showed significant improvement for oedema and erythema of CLE lesions using 0.1% tacrolimus ointment compared to the vehicle. In patients with disfiguring and widespread disease, systemic agents need to be applied. The first-line systemic treatment is antimalarials, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine or quinacrine, which are particularly recommended in patients with a high risk of scarring and/or the development of systemic disease. In addition, systemic corticosteroids are recommended as first-line treatment in highly active and/or severe CLE. Second- and third-line systemic treatments include methotrexate, retinoids, dapsone and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate acid, respectively. Thalidomide should only be used in selected therapy-refractory CLE patients, preferably in addition to antimalarials. Several new therapeutic options, such as B-cell- or interferon alpha-targeted agents, need to be further evaluated in clinical trials to assess their efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with CLE. In 2011, the monoclonal antibody belimumab, a B lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor, was introduced for SLE as an adjunct therapy for patients with autoantibody-positive disease who despite standard therapy show high disease activity, intolerance of other treatments, or an unacceptably high need for corticosteroids. Currently, a validated skin score is used to confirm the efficacy of belimumab on mucocutaneous manifestations. In summary, there is a high unmet need for new therapeutic strategies, such as B-cell- or interferon-targeted agents, focusing on cutaneous manifestations in lupus erythematosus. Therefore, innovative designs of randomised controlled trials are warranted to develop new therapeutic options for patients with refractory skin manifestations in this disease. Case 1: 40-year-old man with SLE and painful erythemato-violaceous lesions Marzia Caproni A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2013 based on photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, positive direct Coombs test, ANA, antidsDNA, Sm, Ro, La, RNP antibodies and low complement, followed by malar rash and discoid lesions on the ears. He started hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg/day, nicotinamide 500 mg/day, topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors with benefit, followed by reactivation of malar rash, worsening of immunological parameters, proteinuria and lupus nephritis two years later. Prednisone 25 mg/day and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 640 mg/day were added with good clinical and laboratory control. In March 2018 he was hospitalised because of suspected macrophage activation syndrome triggered by cytomegalovirus and MMF was withdrawn. As lupus reactivated, in May 2018 he restarted MMF 320 mg/day with prednisone 25 mg/day and HCQ 200 mg/ day. In August 2018, rituximab was administered because of the development of sensory neuropathy with no improvement, thus he underwent intravenous immune globulin treatment with control. In 2020, he developed painful erythemato-violaceous lesions associated with small bullae and ulcers on the distal phalanges of the fingers and toes and of the tip of the nose. Skin lesions were consistent with chilblain lupus. Topical corticosteroid was added. Systemic treatments were replaced by belimumab.

Comorbidities included Hashimoto's thyroiditis and fybromyalgia under L-tyroxine, baclofen and escitalopram treatment. She started HCQ 400 mg/day and prednisone 25 mg/day, tapering to 5 mg/day with initial control. After 2 years of treatment arthralgias worsened as well as skin lesions and laboratory findings. On examination, atrophic painful plaque of the scalp and erythemato-desquamative plaques on the face were revealed. Topical and IV corticosteroids were added without improvement. Patient also underwent methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, rituximab and azathioprine treatment without improvement. We introduced mepacrine 100 mg/day with skin lesion improvement. Due to the difficulty in finding the drug, the patient stopped the treatment with reactivation of the skin manifestations and systemic involvement. We started belimumab 660 mg IV with HCQ 400 mg/day, prednisone 5 mg/day, azathioprine 50 mg/day and duloxetine 60 mg/day with control.

{"text": "Covid-19 and SLE-what do we know today?. Six months following the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic in China, data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases are now available. However, the rapid spread of the pandemic has not allowed proper design of prospective studies, thus evidence came mostly from case series and observational studies. The early enthusiasm on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) antiviral properties should not suggest that patients who are longterm treated with antimalarials, such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, a French report on 17 HCQ-treated SLE patients dampened the enthusiasm.1 A recent report from Covid-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance has described 80 SLE patients with Covid-19, mostly females under 65 years of age, 64% of whom were already taking HCQ before the infection: the rate of hospitalisation and the need for intensive care did not differ between patients who were and those who were not taking HCQ.2 A study group from Northern Italy - the Italian epicentre of the pandemic - reported an incidence of 2.5% of Covid-19 (higher compared to the general population of the same region) in 165 patients with SLE.3 Patients with SLE are possibly at risk of developing symptomatic or severe Covid-19, not only because of their disease or treatment but as a consequence of associated comorbidities known to worsen the outcome of SARS-COv-2 infection. 4 5 What do we know so far? SLE patients should not withdraw their medication. Before drawing any other conclusion, large registry data are needed to clarify the incidence and the outcome of Covid-19 in patients with SLE.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Home Management of Children With COVID-19 in the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. In most children, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild or moderate disease. Moreover, in a relevant number of cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains totally asymptomatic. All these findings seem to suggest that otherwise healthy children with suspected COVID-19 might be managed in the community in most cases, thus avoiding hospital admission and closely related medical, social and economic problems, including overwhelming hospitals. Unfortunately, home management of children with suspected COVID-19 rarely occurs, and many children with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are frequently hospitalized irrespective of the severity of disease. To evaluate the role of community health houses (CHHs) in the management of children with COVID-19, 1,009 children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were studied in Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. Among them, 194 (19.2%) resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority (583, 58%) were tested at home by CHHs, while 426 (42%) were brought to the hospital for testing. The patients who were managed in the hospital had a significantly lower median age than those who were managed at home (2 vs. 12 years, p < 0.001). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases within the family was significantly more frequent among those who were managed at home (82 vs. 46%, p < 0.05). The clinical findings were similar between the children who were managed at home and those who were managed in the hospital. Only one of the children managed at home (0.7%) required hospitalization; in comparison, 26 (48%) of those whose swab samples were taken at the hospital were hospitalized. Our research shows for the first time the importance of CHHs in the management of COVID-19 in children; because of the high frequency of mild to moderate cases, management by CHHs can reduce the care load in hospitals, providing enormous advantages on the familial, medical, social, and economic levels. These findings could be useful for suggesting a territorial rather than hospital-based strategy in pediatrics in the case of a new wave of the epidemic.

Although the prevalence and fatality are negligible among children, a possible impact on their psychological and mental health cannot be disregarded. The unprecedented change in the way of living is bound to be having some psychological consequences on children and adolescents. The experiences gathered in childhood and adolescence are known to contribute to shaping the physical, emotional, and social well-being in adult life. Children are highly susceptible to environmental stressors. The present situation has the potential of adversely affecting the physical and mental well-being of children. To save the children from the long term consequences of this pandemic, a holistic approach integrating biological, psychological, social and spiritual methods of enhancing mental health have become essential.

{"text": "COVID-19 and BCG vaccine: Is there a link?. The spread of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) makes the search for new approaches to prevent the infection of great importance. As one of the relevant approaches, the vaccination of risk groups with BCG vaccine has recently been suggested. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) is a live vaccine for tuberculosis, which is used in many countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and helps preventing childhood tuberculosis, primarily, military disease and tuberculosis meningitis. Whether BCG may be used to increase the protection against COVID-19 is currently a question of debates. The review considers scientific background underlying possible impact of BCG in increased protection against COVID-19. BCG is able of inducing the heterologous and trained immunity, and its capacity to stimulate antiviral immune response has been demonstrated in experimental animals and humans. Our comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in countries with different BCG vaccination policies has demonstrated a milder course of COVID-19 (i.e., a slower increase in disease cases and mortality) in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory for all children. However, an association between BCG vaccination and a milder COVID-19 course is not obligatory direct. Other factors that may affect the association, such as the level of virus testing, the rigidity and the speed of quarantine implementation and others are discussed. An important argument against a role of BCG in the protection against COVID-19 is that BCG is given in childhood and may hardly induce long-lasting immunity. Because mandatory BCG vaccination is implemented in countries with high TB burden and because in these countries latent tuberculosis infection is widely spread, we suggest a hypothesis that latent tuberculosis infection may contribute to the maintenance of heterologous/trained antiviral immunity in countries with mandatory BCG vaccination. Four countries have recently initiated clinical trials to investigate whether BCG vaccination can increase the level of protection against COVID-19 in risk groups. The results of these studies, as well as COVID-19 epidemiological modeling will help understanding the impact of BCG in the level of the protection against COVID-19. Performing analogous clinical trials in Russia seems appropriate and scientifically sound.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

It mainly infects cells of the lower respiratory tract and has been linked to severe respiratory complications. Although multiple routes of transmission have been reported in the literature, there is no definitive evidence for transplacental transmission. We present a case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 likely due to transplacental transmission. 31-year-old Hispanic woman in the final week of pregnancy developed mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gestational diabetes. Two days later, she gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the first day after birth. She was delivered via elective cesarean section adhering to a strict infection control protocol. This report presents a case of a 31-year-old mother with mild symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and who gave birth to a baby girl who was also positive for SARS-CoV-2. This case supports the possibility of transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright \u00a9 Am J Case Rep,.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview. Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures.Copyright \u00a9 2020 S.

{"text": "The Pursuit of COVID-19 Biomarkers: Putting the Spotlight on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Regulatory Sequences. Diverse populations worldwide are differentially affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While socioeconomic background has been studied extensively, little is known about the genetic variation underlying this phenomenon. This study is aimed at examining the genetic basis behind the great discrepancies among diverse ethnic groups in terms of COVID-19 susceptibility for viral infection, disease prognosis, and mortality. To this end, in silico analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within regulatory sequences of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-the virus's gateway to host cells-and their plausible implications on expression levels was conducted. We provide indication that the variation in the human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 regulatory sequences is likely to be involved in and contribute to this phenomenon. SNPs that are abundant in the more susceptible populations introduce binding sites (BSs) for transcription factors or they may invalidate BSs for transcription repressor-both may enhance target gene (ACE2 or TMPRSS2) expression in the relevant target tissues. SNPs that are abundant in the more resistant populations may invalidate BSs for a transcriptional repressor or they may introduce BSs for a transcriptional repressor or initiator of mRNA degradation, which may reduce target gene expression levels. This aspect, when added to the socioeconomic factors, can be a cause for the divergent prevalence of the disease and the different mortality rates within diverse populations. This demonstration may call for a shift in the paradigm of searching for COVID-19 biomarkers, such that SNPs within regulatory sequences should be of high importance.

Design - Longitudinal study of 138 adults with asthma. Setting - Leicestershire Health Authority. Subjects - 48 men and 90 women 19-46 years of age with a mean duration of wheeze of 19.6 years. 75% received regular treatment with bronchodilators; 89% gave a history of eczema, hay fever, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, or allergies; 38% had been admitted to hospital with asthma. Main outcome measures - Symptomatic colds and asthma exacerbations; objective exacerbations of asthma with >=50 l/min reduction in mean peak expiratory flow rate when morning and night time readings on days 1-7 after onset of symptoms were compared with rates during an asymptomatic control period; laboratory confirmed respiratory tract infections. Results - Colds were reported in 80% (223/280) of episodes with symptoms of wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness, and 89% (223/250) of colds were associated with asthma symptoms. 24% of 115 laboratory confirmed non-bacterial infections were associated with reductions in mean peak expiratory flow rate >=50 l/min through days 1-7 and 48% had mean decreases >=25 l/min. 44% of episodes with mean decreases in flow rate >=50 l/min were associated with laboratory confirmed infections. Infections with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and chlamydia were all associated with objective evidence of an exacerbation of asthma.

{"text": "Changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a new form of beta-coronavirus that has been recently discovered and is responsible for COVID 19 pandemic. The earliest infection can be traced back to Wuhan, China. From there it has spread all over the world. Keeping in view the above perspective, an attempt is made in order to find out the epidemiological pattern of COVID 19 pandemic, if any, in different geo-climatological regions of the world in terms of case incidence and mortality. This study is also an endeavor to review and analyze the gradual changes of the genetic makeup of SARS-CoV from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. The raw data of COVID-19 cases and death incidences were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) website from the time period: 1st April to 6th April, 2020. The data that are utilized here for general and Case fatality rate (CFR) based analysis. Western pacific region, European region and Americas have the greatest number of infected cases (P < 0.001); whereas deaths have been found to be significantly higher in Europe (P < 0.001). Total number of confirmed cases and deaths in south-east Asia are comparatively lower (P < 0.001). Case fatality rate (CFR) has also found significant for European region. SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be a strain of SARS-CoV that has a high rate of pathogenicity and transmissibility. Result indicated that the European region has been affected mostly for both cases and death incidences. The novel mutations in SARS-CoV-2 possibly increase the virus infectivity. Genetic heterogeneity of this virus within the human population might originate as the representatives of naturally selected virus quasispecies. In this context, the presence of the asymptomatic individuals could be a significant concern for SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

{"text": "Transmission, start of symptom and morbidity among Danish COVID-19 patient s admitted to hospital. INTRODUCTION: We explored transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely ill patients and analysed the relationship between co-morbidity and mortality or the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care. METHOD(S): Clinical data, treatment and outcome were analysed in this retrospective study of 101 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a regional Danish hospital from 2 March 2020, based on data from electronic medical records. RESULT(S): The mean age was 71.8 years, 33% were never smokers and 82% had one or more predefined chronic diseases. In-hospital mortality was 30%, and 20% of the patients were offered ICU care. In ICU patients, we found a male preponderance (88% versus 44%, p = 0.006), but death (50% versus 25%, p = 0.053) and other pre-defined co-morbidities did not differ significantly from non-ICU patients. The source of infection was unknown in 74% of patients, related to endemic travel in 10%, hospital acquired in 6% and related to close acquaintances in 11%. COVID-19-related symptoms were initially observed from February 21 (week 8 and week 9) in the first three patients who had no known source of infection. We found that 7% of cases had an increased risk of in-hospital transmission, based on a 7-16 days delay in coronavirus testing. CONCLUSION(S): The frequency of co-morbidity in hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients and the correlation to death and ICU attendance were analysed. In all, 74% of the infection cases were of unknown source during the first weeks of the epidemic, which points to considerable community transmission and possibly pre-or asymptomatic transmission, also several weeks before 21 February 2020.

Hamman's syndrome is a spontaneous pneumomediastinum and is described as a rare complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). It typically follows a self-limiting course after successful treatment of the underlying DKA. We describe a case of a 28-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presenting with facial pain, vomiting and abdominal pain. She also complained of dyspnoea and chest pain. She was diagnosed and treated for DKA triggered by a dental abscess. Given the presentation during the coronavirus pandemic, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed in line with the diagnostic pathway for COVID-19, which incidentally showed a significant pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. The patient was initially investigated for oesophageal rupture secondary to vomiting (Boerhaave's syndrome), however, remained clinically stable throughout. Follow-up computed tomography showed near-complete resolution of pneumomediastinum with no intervention other than treatment of DKA. This therefore confirmed Hamman's syndrome. We propose that given the benign nature of the condition and the incidental finding in this report, as well as poor identification of mediastinal gas on chest X-ray, Hamman's syndrome is more common than reported.

Background and Objectives: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious pandemic disease worldwide. Identification of biomarkers to predict severity and prognosis is urgently needed for early medical intervention due to high mortality of critical cases with COVID-19. This retrospective study aimed to indicate the values of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Method(s): We included 46 death cases from intensive care unit and 68 discharged cases from ordinary units with confirmed COVID-19 of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital from January 1 to March 22, 2020. Laboratory and radiologic data were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up until April 10, 2020. Result(s): COVID-19 patients in the death group had significantly higher CEA levels (ng/ml) than discharged group (14.80 +/- 14.20 vs. 3.80 +/- 2.43, P < 0.001). The risk of COVID-19 death increased 1.317 times for each additional 1 ng/ml CEA level (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.099-1.579). The standardized and weighted receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis adjusted to age, sex, and ferritin levels suggested that the area under the curve (AUC) of the serum CEA levels was 0.808 in discrimination between death cases and discharged cases with COVID-19 (P < 0.001). We found mortality of COVID-19 is associated with elevated CEA levels increased (HR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.005-1.042), as well as age (HR = 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016-1.086) and ferritin levels (HR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001-1.002) by survival analysis of Cox regression model. Among discharged patients, CEA levels were significant lower in moderate cases compared to the severe and critical cases (P = 0.005; OR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.294-0.808) from binary logistic regression analysis. The AUC of CEA levels was 0.79 in distinguishing moderate cases from discharged COVID-19 patients by standardized and weighted ROC analysis (P < 0.001). A positive correlation between CEA levels and CT scores existed in discharged patients (Correlation Coefficient: 0.687; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Elevated CEA levels increased the risk of death from COVID-19 and CEA levels were related to CT scores of the discharged patients positively.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Chen, Kong, Qi, Ding, Ji, Wu, Huang, Wu, Huang, Xie, Liu and Tang.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat. Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics. To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol). In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV. As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality.

Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 and called for collaborative efforts from all countries to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19. In pandemic conditions like today, dentists can be the first people to contact with an infected person; these people can become carriers and infect others. COVID-19 transmission during dental treatment can occur through aerosol inhalation or direct contact with saliva, contaminated instruments and surface, especially for children patient in pediatric dentistry. Objective(s): To review the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric dentistry. Literature Review: In the dental environment associated with pediatric dental care, oral fluids from patients or contaminated dental instruments or environmental surfaces create a potential pathway to spread the virus. Dental care procedures which include the use of instruments such as high-speed turbine handpieces and scalers for oral hygiene are associated with the formation of aerosols and large droplets of saliva and blood from patients. Discussion(s): For children able to split, pre-procedural mouth rinse with 0.5%-1% hydrogen peroxide should be used, as it has non specific virucidal activity against corona viruses. Dentists should avoid or minimize operations that can produce droplets or aerosols. Conclusion(s): On the other hand, if faced with a dental emergency, immediate intervention is needed, adherence to the strict protection protocols of each individual involved and environmental disinfection is very important to minimize the risk of cross infection.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

OBJECTIVE: This research (EP-Covid19-Madrid) was inspired on the lack in the middle of March 2020 of data on COVID-19 produced from representative samples. Its goal was to evaluate the potential of interviewing such type of samples in order to assess the incidence and prevalence of epidemics as COVID-19., METHODS: The sample was of 211 households in the city of Madrid, with one informant for all household members (571). Households were selected through random generation of phone numbers, informants through sex and age quotes. A questionnaire was applied on April/3/20, with a list of symptoms and basic socio-demographic questions for the informant and a general question on COVID-19 for co-residents. Data was analyzed through cross-tabulations and logistic regression., RESULTS: Prevalence for individuals. On April/3/20, 10,9% of people 18 years and older living in Madrid reported symptoms compatible with COVID19 (SCC19). Occurrence of SCC19 was similar for both sexes, being respectively above and below the mean for the 40-49 (18,9%) and for the >69 (4%) age groups, showing no relation with household size, but being associated with economic activity (19% among working population) and, even more strongly, with the fact of living with symptomatic co-residents (52%). As for households, there was one member with SCC19 in 17% of households. In 8% of the households two or more members presented SSC19, in fact representing 42,9% of the people in these multiply affected households., CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of SSC19 was much higher than officially reported for COVID-19, although surprisingly low for people of >65. This prevalence associates with work and intra-home transmission. The inter and intra-home prevalence rates (17% and 42,9% respectively) might be useful to assess the proportion of asymptomatic carriers.

The purpose of the research was a detailed consideration of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and methods of diagnosing and treatment of coronavirus-induced coagulopathy (CIC). At the onset of COVID-19, hypercoagulability is detected, and consumption coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome are usually observed at later stages of the disease. In the pathogenesis of hypercoagulation in patients with COVID-19, pro-inflammatory cytokines, hyperfibrinogenemia, increased blood levels of von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, neutrophilic extracellular traps, platelet activation, production of antiphospholipid antibodies, microvesicles are of importance. Laboratory findings show increased plasma concentrations of D-dimer, fibrinogen, a longer prothrombin time and a decrease in the number of platelets. The cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications ranges from 21 to 31%. Thrombosis risk factors are intensive care unit stay, leukocytosis, and a high plasma D-dimer concentration. Differential diagnosing of CIC should be carried out with disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis-induced coagulopathy, antiphospholipid, hemophagocytic syndromes, thrombotic microangiopathy, and heparin-induced thromocytopenia.

In the next step, many experts believe that COVID-19 may become flu-like and coexist with humans. The fundamental solutions of COVID-19, in addition to our own immunity, are to rely on vaccination. The natural immunity of the people after infection has formed a protective wall that protects the naive individuals and prevents disease spreading among the population. This is called herd immunity. But the prerequisite is that there must be enough people with antibodies. Unfortunately, no country meets the requirements till now. In the long run, vaccines are the final solution for newly developed infectious diseases. Owing to time constraints, all countries have stepped up their efforts to invest in vaccine research and development in full swing. However, testing vaccines and medicines without taking the time to fully understand safety risks could bring unwarranted setbacks during the current pandemic, and into the future.

On admission, compared with non-severe patients, more severe patients had a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 3 (58.3% vs 33.8%, P=0.001), D-dimer > 1 mg/L (41.7% vs 13.6%, P<0.0001), higher level of CRP (39.1 mg/L, IQR18.1-75.9 vs 13.4 mg/L, IQR5.0-32.8, P<0.0001), and multiple pneumonia on CT (77.1% vs 18.2%, P<0.0001). All severe patients received oxygen support. 95.8% of them received antivirals, and the most frequent therapy was lopinavir and ritonavir plus human interferon-alpha2b. Moxifloxacin was used in 70.8% severe patients. The total dosage of methylprednisolone sodium succinate was 640 mg (IQR 360-960) in severe patients, and the duration of use was 8.5 days (IQR 6.8-11.3). The total dosage of immunoglobulin was 80 g (IQR, 60-140) in severe patients, and the duration was 8.0 days (IQR, 6.0-11.5). As of March 15, 2020, 95.8% of the severe patients had been discharged and only two deaths occurred., Conclusion: The rate of severe cases and mortality of COVID-19 in Hunan are lower than those in Wuhan. In addition to antivirals and oxygen support, timely interventions including corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, contribute to improving the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.

SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a previously unknown zoonotic coronavirus that spread worldwide causing a serious pandemic. While reliable nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays were rapidly available, only a limited number of validated serological assays were available in the early phase of the pandemic. Here, we evaluated a novel flow cytometric approach to assess spike-specific antibody responses.HEK 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in its natural confirmation on the surface were used to detect specific IgG and IgM antibody responses in patient sera by flow cytometry. A soluble angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE-2) variant was developed as external standard to quantify spike-specific antibody responses on different assay platforms. Analyses of 201 pre-COVID-19 sera proved a high assay specificity in comparison to commercially available CLIA and ELISA systems, while also revealing the highest sensitivity in specimens from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The external standard allowed robust quantification of antibody responses among different assay platforms. In conclusion, our newly established flow cytometric assay allows sensitive and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which can be easily adopted in different laboratories and does not rely on external supply of assay kits. The flow cytometric assay also provides a blueprint for rapid development of serological tests to other emerging viral infectionsCopyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Future generations will look back on this difficult period and see how our society as a whole united and rose to this challenge. Many reports have suggested that this new virus is becoming comparable to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. We provide a statistical study on the modelling and analysis of the daily incidence of COVID-19 in eighteen countries around the world. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to fit count regression models to the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in various countries and make short term predictions of these numbers. The results suggest that the biggest advantage of these methods is that they are simplistic and straightforward allowing us to obtain preliminary results and an overall picture of the trends in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world. The best fitting count regression model for modelling the number of new daily COVID-19 cases of all countries analysed was shown to be a negative binomial distribution with log link function. Whilst the results cannot solely be used to determine and influence policy decisions, they provide an alternative to more specialised epidemiological models and can help to support or contradict results obtained from other analysis.

With the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), countries have been on rising preparedness to detect and isolate any imported and locally transmitted cases of the disease. It is observed that mode of transmission of the disease varies from one country to the other. Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 cases are not influenced by race and weather conditions. In this study, effect of modes of transmission of COVID-19 is considered with respect to prevalence and mortality counts in World Health Organisation (WHO) regions. Also, a negative binomial model is formulated for new death cases in all WHO regions as a function of confirmed cases, confirmed new cases, total deaths and modes of transmission, with the goal of identifying a model that predicts the total new death cases the best. Results from this study show that there is strong linear relationship among the COVID-19 confirmed cases, total new deaths and mode of transmission in all WHO regions. Findings highlight the significant roles of modes of transmission on total new death cases over WHO regions.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a high-mortality global pandemic. The clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is desirable for management, and prioritization for trial enrollment. We developed a prediction rule for COVID-19 mortality in a population-based cohort in Ontario, Canada., Methods: Data from Ontario's provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Logistic regression-based prediction rules and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model were developed and validated using split-halves validation. Sensitivity analyses were performed, with varying approaches to missing data., Results: Of 21 922 COVID-19 cases, 1734 with complete data were included in the derivation set; 1796 were included in the validation set. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease, and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded, long-term care excluded, and Cox model-based). All displayed excellent discrimination (area under the curve for all rules > 0.92) and calibration (P > .50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All performed well in the validation set and were robust to varying approaches to replacement of missing variables., Conclusions: We used a public health case management data system to build and validate 4 accurate, well-calibrated, robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada.

{"text": "Initial whole-genome sequencing and analysis of the host genetic contribution to COVID-19 severity and susceptibility. The COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for millions of infections and hundreds of thousand deaths worldwide in a short-time period. The patients demonstrate a great diversity in clinical and laboratory manifestations and disease severity. Nonetheless, little is known about the host genetic contribution to the observed interindividual phenotypic variability. Here, we report the first host genetic study in the Chinese population by deeply sequencing and analyzing 332 COVID-19 patients categorized by varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Upon a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests among five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical ill patients after the correction of potential confounding factors. Pedigree analysis suggested a potential monogenic effect of loss of function variants in GOLGA3 and DPP7 for critically ill and asymptomatic disease demonstration. Genome-wide association study suggests the most significant gene locus associated with severity were located in TMEM189-UBE2V1 that involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The p.Val197Met missense variant that affects the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein displays a decreasing allele frequency among the severe patients compared to the mild and the general population. We identified that the HLA-A*11:01, B*51:01, and C*14:02 alleles significantly predispose the worst outcome of the patients. This initial genomic study of Chinese patients provides genetic insights into the phenotypic difference among the COVID-19 patient groups and highlighted genes and variants that may help guide targeted efforts in containing the outbreak.

To assess the liver density according to the data of native CT studies in patients with COVID-19, depending on the severity of the pulmonary parenchyma damage and the prescribed treatment, to compare the data with biochemical indicators, and also to demonstrate changes in density indicators over time. Material and methods. Lung CT data from 200 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. The density of the liver, spleen, and subcutaneous fat tissue was measured in all patients on the images of the upper abdominal cavity that entered the scan area. The ratio of the density of the liver to the spleen and to the density of the fat tissue was assesed. These indicators were compared with each other in two groups of lung tissue damage: CT 1-2 and CT 3-4. The CT 3-4 group was assessed in detail: the density indicators of the liver were studied in dynamics, and their relationship with biochemical indicators - during the initial study. A comparison was also made between two subgroups: patients taking tocilizumab and those without tocilizumab. Results. A decrease in liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density was observed in 35.5% and 47.5% of patients respectively. Liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density were lower in the CT 3-4 group than in the CT 1-2 group, and amounted to 43.9 HU versus 49.3 HU (p < 0.008) and 0.9 versus 1.0 respectively (p < 0.014). In the initial study, there were a moderate (r = -0.30; p < 0.05) and weak (r = -0.26; p < 0.05) negative correlation of liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density with serum albumin. When assessing the dynamics in patients in the CT 3-4 group, with each subsequent study, an increase in the density of the liver parenchyma and the ratio of liver density to spleen density was noted. The difference between the mean values of liver density at the first and at the fourth CT examinations was 11.85 HU. Liver density values were independent of treatment with tocilizumab. Conclusion. Liver density values were lower in patients with COVID-19 with the degree of lung parenchyma lesion CT 3-4, increased during treatment and did not depend on the prescription of tocilizumab. Evaluation and monitoring of the dynamics of liver density could become a useful parameter in determining the severity of the disease course.

Background: In December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, China, and soon became a global health problem. Since its outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has had a major impact on clinical diagnostic laboratories. The scientific community has quickly risen to the occasion and reports of new developments have arrived at an unprecedented scale. At present, there is a growing list of over 400 SARC-CoV-2 diagnostic tests either in development or approved for clinical use. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID- 19 in microbiology laboratories and also provides an insight into the future diagnostics approaches. Method(s): Proper respiratory specimen collected at the appropriate time and from the right anatomical site is critical in the accurate and timely diagnosis of SARSCoV2. While oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for the detection of early infection, other lower respiratory tract specimens like the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are used for late detection and monitoring of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Results and Conclusion(s): Real-time RT-PCR based molecular assay remains the test of choice for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 while serological tests are being introduced as supplementary tools. Finally, there is an urgent need for scaling up the diagnostic capacity by the introduction of reliable and accurate point-of-care tests which will assist in effective control of this outbreak.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study on the use of interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN beta-1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN beta-1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir). Each 44-mug/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon beta-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group consisted of 39 patients who received only the national protocol medications. The primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization. Between 29 February and 3 April 2020, 92 patients were recruited, and a total of 42 patients in the IFN group and 39 patients in the control group completed the study. As the primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 +/- 5.8 versus 8.3 +/- 4.9 days, respectively, P = 0.95).

{"text": "Biological Rationale for the Repurposing of BCG Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is still widely used in the developing world. The vaccination prevents infant death not only from tuberculosis but also from unrelated infectious agents, especially respiratory tract infections and neonatal sepsis. It is proposed that these off-target protective effects of the BCG vaccine are mediated by the general long-term boosting of innate immune mechanisms, also termed \"trained innate immunity\". Recent studies indicate that both COVID-19 incidence and total deaths are strongly associated with the presence or absence of national mandatory BCG vaccination programs and encourage the initiation of several clinical studies with the expectation that revaccination with BCG could reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 10 million infections and more than 500,000 fatalities by June 2020. To initiate infection, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes attachment to the host cell surface and fusion of the viral and host membranes. Prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of vaccine design. However, its limited stability and conformational dynamics are limiting factors for developing countermeasures against this virus. We report here the design of a construct corresponding to the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond in the closed conformation. Structural and antigenicity analyses show we successfully shut S in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture.

{"text": "Biomarkers of COVID-19 and technologies to combat SARS-CoV-2. Due to the unprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID-19, our first contribution to the newly launching journal, Advances in Biomarker Sciences and Technology, has abruptly diverted to focus on the current pandemic. As the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise steadily around the world, the common goal of healthcare providers, scientists, and government officials worldwide has been to identify the best way to detect the novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and to treat the viral infection - COVID-19. Accurate detection, timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and future prevention are the vital keys to management of COVID-19, and can help curb the viral spread. Traditionally, biomarkers play a pivotal role in the early detection of disease etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. To assist myriad ongoing investigations and innovations, we developed this current article to overview known and emerging biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 detection, COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and prognosis, and ongoing work to identify and develop more biomarkers for new drugs and vaccines. Moreover, biomarkers of socio-psychological stress, the high-technology quest for new virtual drug screening, and digital applications are described.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Epidemiological Characteristics and Clinical Features of Patients Infected With the COVID-19 Virus in Nanchang, Jiangxi, China. Objectives: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest public health crises in the 21st century. While most patients infected with the COVID-19 virus have no to moderate symptoms, there is currently limited clinical information about these patients. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively investigated 41 patients infected with the COVID-19 virus in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China, from February 4 to March 2, 2020. Nanchang is about 260 km southeast of Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrieved information on patient demographics, physical examination results, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying conditions, laboratory analyses, radiological images, and treatment outcomes. Result(s): Most patients (70.7%) had a history of close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19, and 16 patients (39.0%) showed a high degree of family clustering. All 41 patients had no to moderate symptoms. The median age was 39.9 years and common symptoms of illness were fever (69.2%), cough (65.4%), and fatigue (19.2%). The dominant patient group was middle-aged women, with hypertension (14.6%) and chronic liver disease (12.2%) as the most frequent underlying conditions. All patients recovered, with the mean time of viral nucleic acid clearance at 10.6 days. Chest CT scans presented ground-glass opacities in 53.7% of patients while 26.8% had normal CT images. Laboratory results showed that lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte percentages, ESR, CRP, IgG, Fib, and cytokines were correlated to patients' conditions. Approximately 60-90% of patients had abnormally high levels of cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and/or TNF-alpha. Conclusion(s): Our results showed variable clinical and laboratory presentations among this group of patients infected with the COVID-19 virus. Though all 41 patients recovered, our results suggest that cytokine levels and other biochemical indicators should be monitored for patients infected with the COVID-19 virus showing no to moderate symptoms to ensure quick access for critical medical attention, if needed.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Hong, Hu, Zhong, Zhu, Hang, Fang, Sun, Huang, Xu and Chen.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "40 Racial Disparity and Covid-19 Outcomes: An Emergency Department Study. Study Objectives: The effects of COVID-19 on racial groups is still emerging, however a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that there may be a disproportionate rate of severity of disease presentation in racial and ethnic minority groups. Health differences have been attributed to economic and social conditions that are more prevalent for racial minorities. These conditions can cause isolation from resources necessary to combat the outbreak. We suspect that these factors that may contribute to increased Covid-19 exposures, that lead to a greater rate of infection and increased risk of severe disease in minority groups Methods: Data collected from three ED, all sites of an emergency medicine residency. Included are patients with SAR-CoV-2 testing done in the ED. Excluded were patients less than 18, pregnancy, and missing data. Race was categorized into White-Caucasian (W), African-American (B), Latinx (L), and others including multi-racial (O). COVID co-morbidities were defined as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, liver disease, venous thrombosis, cancer, HIV, and immune-compromised. 5% of patients' select variables were manually re-abstracted with a Kappa of 100%. Significance (alpha=0.05) was tested using Student-t, ANOVA, and Chi-squared as appropriate. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent effect of race on outcomes. Result(s): 5489 cases met inclusion/exclusion criteria. SAR-CoV-2 was detected in 1849 (33.7%). Tested racial diversity was 37.9% W, 20.0% B, 33.5% L, and 8.6% O. There was significant racial disparity in the positivity rate (W: 25.0%, B: 31.9%, L: 43.8%, O: 36.7%; p<.001). Hospitalized were 1112 (60.1%) positive patients with mean age of 67.7, 42.4% female, acuity 2.49 (1-5, 1 worst), and racial diversity W: 36.8%, B: 19.3%, L: 35.9%, O: 8.0%. As of 6-5-2020, there were 265 deaths (23.8%) and 180 placed on ventilators (16.2%) with a combined mortality morbidity (MM) of 359 (32.3%). Age (p<0.001), acuity (p<0.001), co-morbidities (p=0.003), and race (p<0.001) were all significantly associated with mortality. On logistic regression, age (OR=1.049; p<0.001), sex (OR=0.647; p=0.008), and acuity (OR=0.434; P<0.001) were significant predictors of mortality. There were significant mortality differences among races (B v W, OR=0.566; p=0.021, L v W, OR=1.050; p=0.817, O v W, OR=0.866; p=0.630). Significant racial differences were also found for ventilator need (B v W, OR=0.792; p=0.433, L v W, OR=2.24; p=0.001, O v W, OR=1.71; p=0.110). Co-morbidities were not significant when controlled for age and other confounders. Conclusion(s): Our findings showed minority groups were more likely to have a positive COVID-19 test. Latinx patients were more than twice as likely to require intubation compared to white patients. Age, Sex, Triage Acuity Level, and non-White Race were significantly associated with mortality. This data suggests non-White patients are more likely to contract and suffer from Covid-19. These findings show minority groups have a greater need for ventilators and other resources associated with severe Covid-19. In the event of resource shortages, they should be directed to minority communities. [Formula presented]Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Homeopathic Clinical Features of 18 Patients in COVID-19 Outbreaks in Hong Kong. Background Hong Kong is geographically located in the province of Guangdong which, after Hubei, has been the region of China second-most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the pathognomonic symptoms of the named disease, homeopathic symptoms are always more helpful for homeopathic prescriptions. Aim This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 confirmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020. Methods Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to their concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctive measure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, common rubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined. Results Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identified as mild and belonging to one of six separate clusters, are reported. Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n = 4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n = 12). Eight and seven differentiating features, respectively, were identified for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens. Conclusion The common symptoms of 18 mild COVID-19 cases constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures, indicating Bryonia alba or Gelsemium sempervirens; they were indicated in 4 and 12 cases, respectively, out of the 18 in total.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

{"text": "Localization of mouse hepatitis virus nonstructural proteins and RNA synthesis indicates a role for late endosomes in viral replication. The aim of the present study was to define the site of replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Antibodies directed against several proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein, including the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the putative polymerase (POL), helicase, and a recently described protein (p22) derived from the C terminus of the open reading frame 1a protein (CT1a), were used to probe MHV-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). At early times of infection, all of these proteins showed a distinct punctate labeling by IF. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein also displayed a punctate labeling that largely colocalized with the replicase proteins. When infected cells were metabolically labeled with 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate (BrUTP), the site of viral RNA synthesis was shown by IF to colocalize with CT1a and the 3CLpro. As shown by EM, CT1a localized to LAMP-1 positive late endosomes/lysosomes while POL accumulated predominantly in multilayered structures with the appearance of endocytic carrier vesicles. These latter structures were also labeled to some extent with both anti-CT1a and LAMP-1 antibodies and could be filled with fluid phase endocytic tracers. When EM was used to determine sites of BrUTP incorporation into vital RNA at early times of infection, the vital RNA localized to late endosomal membranes as well. These results demonstrate that MHV replication occurs on late endosomal membranes and that several nonstructural proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein may participate in the formation and function of the vital replication complexes.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Several members of the mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related glycoprotein family are functional receptors for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus- A59. Mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59), a murine coronavirus, can utilize as a cellular receptor MHVR, a murine glycoprotein in the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) subfamily of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family in the immunoglobulin superfamily (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin- like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)(L)]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)(L) isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59. This is the first report of multiple related glycoprotein isoforms that can serve as functional receptors for a single enveloped virus.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The pandemic COVID-19 abruptly exploded, taking most health professionals around the world unprepared. Italy, the first European country to be hit violently, was forced to activate the lockdown in mid-February 2020. At the time of the spread, a high number of victims were quickly registered, especially in the regions of Northern Italy which have a high rate of highly-polluting production activities. The need to hospitalize the large number of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 led the National Health System to move a large number of specialists from their disciplines to the emergency hospital departments for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, the lockdown itself has limited the possibility for general practitioners and pediatricians to be able to make outpatient visits and/or home care for patients with chronic diseases. Among them, the patient with atopic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, is worthy of particular attention as she/he is immersed in a studded negative scenario with the onset of spring, a factor that should not be underestimated for those who suffer from pollen allergy.

Several studies suggested that the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism but the incidence of thrombotic complications in the late phase of the disease is currently unknown. The present article describes three cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and late occurrence of pulmonary embolism. Case 1: a 57-year-old man diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and type B aortic dissection after 12 days from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Laboratory panel at the time of pulmonary embolism showed no signs of ongoing inflammation but only an elevated D-dimer. Case 2: a 76-year-old man with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia followed by pulmonary embolism 20 days later, high-resolution computed tomography on that time showed a partial resolution of crazy paving consolidation. Case 3: a 77-year-old man with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who developed a venous thromboembolic event despite thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Also in this patients no markers of inflammation were present at the time of complication. The present cases raise the possibility that in SARS-CoV-2 infection the hypercoagulable state may persist over the active inflammation phase and cytokine storm.

{"text": "Impact of timely public health measures on kidney transplantation in austria during the sars-cov-2 outbreak-a nationwide analysis. SARS-CoV-2 led to considerable morbidity/mortality worldwide and tremendously impacted on daily life. Strict lockdown measures were implemented early to contain the viral outbreak in Austria. Massive changes in organizational structures of healthcare facilities followed with unclear implications on the care of non-COVID-19-affected patients. We studied the nationwide impact of COVID-19 on kidney transplantation in Austria during the first six months of 2020. Concurrent with general lockdown measures, all kidney transplant activity was suspended from 13 March to 9 April. Nevertheless, between January and June, total transplant (p = 0.48) and procured donor organ numbers (p = 0.6) did not differ significantly from earlier years. Ten (0.18%) of 5512 prevalent Austrian kidney transplant recipients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality rate (one death; 10%) in renal transplant patients was less than in other countries but higher than in Austria's general population (2.4%). We conclude that early and strict general lockdown measures imposed by the government allowed an early, however cautious, re-opening of Austrian transplant programs and played a crucial role for the favorable outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Austrian kidney transplant patients. Even though it may be uncertain whether similar results may be obtainable in other countries, the findings may support early intervention strategies during similar episodes in the future.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

{"text": "Implications for border containment strategies when COVID-19 presents atypically. Objectives: For a large part of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore had managed to keep local cases in the single digits daily, with decisive measures. Yet, we saw this critical time point when the imported cases surged through our borders. The gaps which we can and have efficiently closed, using a public health approach and global border containment strategies, are aptly illustrated through this case. This critical point of imported case surge has resulted in a large spike of daily local cases sustained through community transmission, up to 120/day within a very short time frame. We were able to rapidly bring this under control. Study design: This is a case study of a patient who passed through our borders, with COVID-19 masquerading as a resolved sore throat. Method(s): The events were prospectively documented. Result(s): We present a case of a 21-year-old student returning from Nottingham. He presented with sore throat as the only symptom the few days prior his return, and on arrival at our border (day 7 from initial symptoms), his sore throat had already resolved. The events leading up to his COVID-19 diagnosis highlight the gaps of the international screening processes at the global border entry and the potential consequences of community chain transmission through imported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion(s): An important global border control measure to implement quickly will be to expand the symptom list to isolated sore throat and/or a prior history of recent symptoms (resolved). This may capture a larger proportion of imported cases at border entry point for more effective containment. This piece will be equally relevant to the general physicians, emergency care physicians, otolaryngologists and anaesthetists, who are at higher risk of encountering a throat visualization during intubation and routine examination.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is being caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease continues to present significant challenges to the health care systems around the world. This is primarily because of the lack of vaccines to protect against the infection and the lack of highly effective therapeutics to prevent and/or treat the illness. Nevertheless, researchers have swiftly responded to the pandemic by advancing old and new potential therapeutics into clinical trials. In this review, we summarize potential anti-COVID-19 therapeutics that block the early stage of the viral life cycle. The review presents the structures, mechanisms, and reported results of clinical trials of potential therapeutics that have been listed in clinicaltrials.gov. Given the fact that some of these therapeutics are multi-acting molecules, other relevant mechanisms will also be described. The reviewed therapeutics include small molecules and macromolecules of sulfated polysaccharides, polypeptides, and monoclonal antibodies. The potential therapeutics target viral and/or host proteins or processes that facilitate the early stage of the viral infection. Frequent targets are the viral spike protein, the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the host transmembrane protease serine 2, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis process. Overall, the review aims at presenting update-to-date details, so as to enhance awareness of potential therapeutics, and thus, to catalyze their appropriate use in combating the pandemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

At present, the time-frame used for the quarantine of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the entire duration of symptoms plus 14 days after symptom recovery; however, no data have been reported specifically for healthcare workers (HCWs). In the study population of 142 HCWs with COVID-19, the mean time for viral clearance was 31.8 days. Asymptomatic subjects cleared the virus more quickly than symptomatic subjects (22 vs 34.2 days; P<0.0001). The presence of fever at the time of diagnosis was associated with a longer time to viral clearance (relative risk 11.45, 95% confidence interval 8.66-14.25; P<0.0001).

{"text": "The internal open reading frame within the nucleocapsid gene of mouse hepatitis virus encodes a structural protein that is not essential for viral replication. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains a large open reading frame embedded entirely within the 5' half of its nucleocapsid (N) gene. This internal gene (designated 1) is in the +1 reading frame with respect to the N gene, and it encodes a mostly hydrophobic 23-kDa polypeptide. We have found that this protein is expressed in MHV-infected cells and that it is a previously unrecognized structural protein of the virion. To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site-directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination. The start codon for I was replaced by a threonine codon, and a stop codon was introduced at a short interval downstream. Both alterations created silent changes in the N reading frame. In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals. These results demonstrate that I protein is not essential for the replication of MHV either in tissue culture or in its natural host.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been controlled, the subsequently emerging sporadic cases in 2004 emphasize the necessity of developing a rapid diagnostic method, which would be of great help in clinical diagosis and also wild host screening. This study aims to establish an effective and rapid serological tool for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV by comparison among whole viral, N and N 199 proteins by ELISA. Method(s): SARS-CoV N and N199 (a truncated nucleocapsid gene) genes were cloned, expressed, identified by Western blotting, and applied in screening of human and swine samples. Sera of SARS convalescent-phase patients, normal human sera, sera of patients with other respiratory diseases, and swine sera were screened by ELISA, with whole SARS-CoV F69, N and N199 proteins as antigens. Result(s): The sensitivity and specificity of N and N199 proteins in human sera diagnosis were approximate (P=0.743), which was higher than whole viral protein but the difference was not significant (P=0.234).

{"text": "Premature Death Rate Geography in New York City: Implications for COVID-19. New York City (NYC), in the early stages of the pandemic, had the highest number and incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in US cities. The foundation of this public health catastrophe lies in the overall public health and socioeconomic (SE) structure of the city. Premature (below age 65) mortality rate indicates background public health. In year 2000, community districts (CDs) with low population percent over age 65 had high incidence of HIV mortality and its three associated mortalities (homicide, drugs, liver disease) as well as high poverty rate, high unemployment, low median income, and low percent adults with college or higher degrees. NYC Health Department's use of age 65 as the benchmark for premature death departs from that of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics which uses age 75. This departure contributes to an underestimation of premature mortality rates and of public health deficiencies. This study examines 2017 premature mortality rate of CDs, health outcomes associated with it, and contextual SE factors. Four health outcomes associated with premature mortality rate in multivariate regression: HIV, diabetes, and drug mortality rates and percent of births to teenagers. SE factors associated with premature mortality rate and its health guild were serious housing violations per 1000 units, unemployment rate, poverty rate, percent adults with college or higher degrees (the only negative association), and indicators of segregation. Much of the context of year 2000 patterns of mortality disparities remained in 2017. The coronavirus pandemic plays out in NYC in this SE/public health system. Old age and age-related chronic conditions emerged as raised risks for serious COVID injury and death.

{"text": "Clinical application of Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. Background: The unsatisfactory accuracy and capacity of real time RT-PCR depends on several unavoidable reasons, which cannot meet the demands for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Results: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o.. Conclusions: The CMIA can provide important complementation to nucleic acid assay and help to enhance the accuracy and capacity of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Purpose: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of 194 cases coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Huanggang, Hubei and Taian, Shandong. Method(s): We retrospectively investigated the clinical, laboratory characteristics and CT imaging of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 22 to February 28, 2020 in Huanggang Central Hospital and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. Real time PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expressions of ACE2 in tissues. Result(s): Among the 194 patients infected with COVID-19, 108 patients were male, with a median age of 48.3 years. The average preclinical period was 7.44 day. Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 190 (97.94%) patients were confirmed during the three times nucleic acid test. The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction.

{"text": "Ability of the immune system to fight viruses highlighted by cytometry and T-cell receptor clonotype assessment: Lessons taken before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak. The intriguing aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the high rate of spread and rapid progression of pneumonitis. Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to quickly build the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage of past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor gammadelta cells are in the first line of defense, activated by stress molecules and recognizing some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex-independent but still specific, eg, cytomegalovirus, as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism-both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. Most deaths occur due to pneumonitis, in the course of which overwhelming inflammation impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails and, therefore, patients at risk, mostly the elderly, show higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and enhanced inflammation in the lungs. Apparently, there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype-associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, considering the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these 2 immunotherapeutic tools is understandable based on basic immunology and this knowledge may direct the efforts of the medical community aimed at combating the virus.\u00a9 Copyright by the Author(s), 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In 1947 and 1948 ZIKV was first isolated from a nonhuman primate as well as from mosquitoes in Africa, respectively. For half a century, ZIKV infections in human were sporadic prior to 2015-2016 pandemic spreading. Transmission of ZIKV from mother to fetus can occur in any trimester of pregnancy, even if mother was an asymptomatic carrier. The clinical signs of ZIKV infection are nonspecific and can be misdiagnosed as some other infectious diseases, especially those caused by arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya. ZIKV infection was solely associated with mild illness prior to the large French Polynesian and Brazil outbreaks, when severe neurological complications, Guillain-Barre syndrome and dramatically increased rate of severe congenital malformations (including microcephaly) were reported. The adaptation of ZIKV to an urban cycle in endemic areas suggests that the incidence of ZIKV infections may be underestimated.

{"text": "Dual lateral flow optical/chemiluminescence immunosensors for the rapid detection of salivary and serum IgA in patients with COVID-19 disease. To accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection and its time-dependent progression, the rapid, sensitive, and noninvasive determination of immunoglobulins A specific to SARS-CoV-2 (IgA) in saliva and serum is needed to complement tests that detect immunoglobulins G and M. We have developed a dual optical/chemiluminescence format of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) immunosensor for IgA in serum and saliva. A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H2O2/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease. This IgA-LFIA immunosensor could be useful for noninvasively monitoring early immune responses to COVID-19 and for investigating the diagnostic/prognostic utility of salivary IgA in the context of large-scale screening to assess the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Rheumatic patients should be given special attention regarding COVID-19 infection due to their immunocompromised state resulting from their underlying immune conditions and use of targeted immune-modulating therapies. Studying epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with SARS-CoV2 is pivotal to clarify determinants of COVID-19 disease severity in patients with underlying rheumatic disease. Objective(s): To describe epidemiological characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and determine risk factors associated with mortality in a third level Hospital setting in Leon, Spain. Method(s): We performed a prospective observational study, from 1st March 2020 until the 1st of June including adults with rheumatic diseases hospitalized with COVID-19 and performed a univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of mortality. Age, sex, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis and treatment, disease activity prior to infection, radiographic and laboratorial results at arrival were analysed. Result(s): During the study period, 3711 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital, of whom 38 (10%) had a rheumatic or musculoskeletal disease. Fifty-three percent were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 75.3 (IQR 68-83) years. The median length of stay was 11 days.

{"text": "Effect of a strict hygiene bundle for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital: a practical approach from the field. Background: During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic it is crucial for hospitals to implement infection prevention strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission to the lowest possible number. This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. Method(s): All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. Result(s): In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global adoption of stay-at-home mandates in an effort to curb viral spread. This lockdown has had the unintended consequence of decreasing physical activity, and incidence of low back pain (LBP) is likely to rise as sedentary behavior increases. OBJECTIVE(S): In this article, we aim to provide a fundamental, novel approach to alleviate LBP including desk worker associated LBP exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): Individuals can alleviate their LBP through a simplistic, self-therapeutic approach: myofascial release and stretching of key musculature involved in LBP following a simple technique and associated time domain, as well as a 360-degree strengthening of the muscles surrounding the lower back. Additional muscular strength will support the lower back and lend resilience to aid in the mitigation of pain caused by poor work-related postural positions. RESULT(S): We demonstrate several exercises and movements aimed at alleviating LBP. Additionally, we provide a summary graphic which facilitates ease of use of the exercise plan and represents a novel methodology for simple distribution of evidence-based pain reduction strategies.

{"text": "Investigating the Prevalence of Reactive Online Searching in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infoveillance Study. BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on global society, health care, governments, and mass media. Public dissemination of government policies, medical interventions, and misinformation has been remarkably rapid and largely unregulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased misinterpretations, miscommunication, and public panic. Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to COVID-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries. METHOD(S): This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases. RESULT(S): Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these COVID-19-related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, SD 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, SD 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, SD 0.112). CONCLUSION(S): These findings illustrate the increased rate and volume of the public consumption of novel information during a global health care crisis. The positive correlation between mortality and online searching, particularly in countries with lower COVID-19 testing rates, may demonstrate the imperative to safeguard official communications and dispel misinformation in these countries. Online news, government briefings, and social media provide a powerful tool for the dissemination of important information to the public during pandemics, but their misuse and the presentation of misrepresented medical information should be monitored, minimized, and addressed to safeguard public safety. Ultimately, governments, public health authorities, and scientists have a moral imperative to safeguard the truth and maintain an accessible discourse with the public to limit fear.Copyright \u00a9Rafael A Badell-Grau, Jordan Patrick Cuff, Brendan P Kelly, Helen Waller-Evans, Emyr Lloyd-Evans.

{"text": "Addressing Social Determinants of Liver Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: A Call to Action. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed health care inequities in the United States and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of individuals. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the \"new normal,\" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of health care delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Objective: In an effort to improve the efficiency of computer algorithms applied to screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing, we used natural language processing and artificial intelligence-based methods with unstructured patient data collected through telehealth visits. Material(s) and Method(s): After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. Result(s): Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling. Conclusion(s): Informatics tools such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.Copyright VC The Author(s) 2020.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A Review of the Progress and Challenges of Developing a Vaccine for COVID-19. A novel coronavirus, which has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan China and causes the highly infectious disease referred to as COVID-19. COVID-19 has now spread worldwide to become a global pandemic affecting over 24 million people as of August 26th, 2020 and claimed the life of more than 800,000 people worldwide. COVID-19 is asymptomatic for some individuals and for others it can cause symptoms ranging from flu-like to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and death. Although it is anticipated that an effective vaccine will be available to protect against COVID-19, at present the world is relying on social distancing and hygiene measures and repurposed drugs. There is a worldwide effort to develop an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and, as of late August 2020, there are 30 vaccines in clinical trials with over 200 in various stages of development. This review will focus on the eight vaccine candidates that entered Phase 1 clinical trials in mid-May, including AstraZeneca/Oxford's AZD1222, Moderna's mRNA-1273 and Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccines, which are currently in advanced stages of vaccine development. In addition to reviewing the different stages of vaccine development, vaccine platforms and vaccine candidates, this review also discusses the biological and immunological basis required of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the importance of a collaborative international effort, the ethical implications of vaccine development, the efficacy needed for an immunogenic vaccine, vaccine coverage, the potential limitations and challenges of vaccine development. Although the demand for a vaccine far surpasses the production capacity, it will be beneficial to have a limited number of vaccines available for the more vulnerable population by the end of 2020 and for the rest of the global population by the end of 2021.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and highly contagious disease caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death. This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation. Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively. Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis. A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT). Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged. All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.Copyright \u00a9 2020 European Association of Urology", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Male predisposition to severe COVID-19: Review of evidence and potential therapeutic prospects. The severe form of COVID-19 has significant sex disparities, with high fatalities commonly reported among males than females. The incidence of COVID-19 has also been higher in males compared with their female counterparts. This trend could be attributed to a better responsive and robust immune system in females. Cytokine storm is one of the pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19, and it occurs as a result of over-activation of immune cells leading to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Nevertheless, it is well modulated in females compared to their male counterparts. Severe inflammation in males is reported to facilitate progression of mild to severe COVID-19. The sex hormones, estrogens and androgens which exist in varying functional levels respectively in females and males are cited as the underlying cause for the differential immune response to COVID-19. Evidence abounds that estrogen modulate the immune system to protect females from severe inflammation and for that matter severe COVID-19. On the contrary, androgen has been implicated in over-activation of immune cells, cytokine storm and the attendant severe inflammation, which perhaps predispose males to severe COVID-19. In this review efforts are made to expand understanding and explain the possible roles of the immune system, the sex hormones and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) systems in male bias to severe COVID-19. Also, this review explores possible therapeutic avenues including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), estrogen-based therapy, and ACE inhibitors for consideration in the fight against COVID-19.

PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on general surgical emergencies as well as analyzing the effectiveness of measures taken in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and healthcare professionals. METHOD(S): Patients who underwent emergency surgery between the pandemic period of March 14th to May 15th 2020 and within the same period from the previous year were reviewed retrospectively. COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULT(S): Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n=103) was lower than the control group (n=252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p=0.001, p=0.019, respectively). The rate of mortality was higher in patients who underwent emergency surgery during pandemic (p=0.049). The results of COVID-19 screening were positive in 6 (6/103, 5.82%) patients undergoing emergency surgery. None of the doctors working in the ward were infected with COVID-19 infection (0/20). The screening tests were positive in only two nurses working on the ward (2/24, 8.33%).

Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation face increased mortality. There is an urgent need for effective treatments to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective(s): Our protocol aimed at evaluating the potential improvement in clinical outcomes with mavrilimumab, an anti-Granulocyte/Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor alpha (GM-CSFRalpha) monoclonal antibody, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyper-inflammation. Method(s): Single-center, open-label, single active arm intervention; Adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (as evaluated by CT scanning), hypoxia (PaO2:FiO2 ratio <= 300 mmHg), and systemic hyper-inflammation (increased C-reactive protein [CRP] >= 100 mg/mL and/or ferritin >= 900 mug/L, increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) received a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab added to standard of care; follow-up 28 days. Main outcomes measure was time to clinical improvement (reduction >= 2 categories on the 7-point WHO clinical status scale, 1=discharge, 7=death); others included time to discharge from hospital; % of pts achieving a clinical improvement; survival; mechanical-ventilation free survival; time to fever resolution; CRP; PaO2:FiO2 ratio.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated demographics, co-morbidities and death rate in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. In addition, we hypothesized that functional status, according to Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), in patients aged 65 years and older is a better predictor of poor outcome than age and co-morbidities. METHOD(S): A total of 255 randomly selected COVID-19 patients admitted at a university hospital were included and followed for 60 days. Patient data was extracted manually from the electronic health records using a standardized protocol. RESULT(S): The age of the study population ranged between 20 and 103 years, (mean age was 66+/-17 years). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity were the three most prevalent co-morbidities. At the 60-day follow-up, 70 patients (27%) had died. In multivariate analyses, age, chronic kidney disease and previous stroke were associated with death. Most fatal cases (90%) occurred in older patients. Among the older patients, CFS was the only predictor of death in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that higher age, chronic kidney disease and previous stroke significantly contribute to a fatal outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients aged 65 years and older, CFS was the strongest prognostic factor for mortality.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

{"text": "Reduced Self-Awareness Following a Combined Polar and Paramedian Bilateral Thalamic Infarction. A Possible Relationship With SARS-CoV-2 Risk of Contagion?. Reduced self-awareness is a well-known phenomenon investigated in patients with vascular disease; however, its impact on neuropsychological functions remains to be clarified. Importantly, selective vascular lesions provide an opportunity to investigate the key neuropsychological features of reduced self-awareness in neurocognitive disorders. Because of its rarity, we present an unusual case of a woman affected by a combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic infarction. The patient underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation to assess cognitive, behavioral, and functional domains, with a focus on executive functions. She was assessed clinically in the acute phase and after 6 months from the stroke, both clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient developed a cognitive impairment, characterised by prevalent executive dysfunction associated with reduced self-awareness and mood changes, in terms of apathy and depression. Such condition persisted after 6 months. In May 2020, the patient underwent the serology test in chemiluminescence to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The result of the quantitative test highlighted a high probability of previous contact with the virus. We suggest that reduced self-awareness related to executive dysfunction and behavioral changes may be due to combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic lesion. Metacognitive-executive dysfunction affecting the instrumental abilities of everyday life might make people less able to take appropriate precautions, facilitating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion.

Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 pneumonia (CARDS) represents a clinical challenge, requiring often invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Since the pathogenesis of CARDS it probably involves a direct viral attack to pulmonary and endothelium cells, and immune-mediated inflammation with dysfunctional coagulation, it was suggested to interfere with interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity by using the IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ). We reported the case of a 54-year-old 100 kg male COVID-19 patient (BMI 29) with severe respiratory insufficiency featuring dyspnea and hypoxia (SpO2 89% on room; PaO2 53 mmHg). Despite treatment with antiviral and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), after 24 h there was a progressive worsening of clinical conditions with higher fever (40 degreeC), increased dyspnea, and hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio of 150). The patient was at the limit to be sedated and intubated for IMV. He was treated with tocilizumab (8 mg/Kg i.v., single shot 800 mg) and NIV in the prone positioning. After only 96 h, the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings showed incredible improvement. There was an important gain in oxygenation (P/F 300), a decrease of C-reactive protein values, and a decrease of the fever. Both the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the derived NLR ratio dropped down to 44%. Chest imaging confirmed the favorable response.

Bacterial co-infections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in respiratory viral infections; however, microbiological and antibiotic data related to COVID-19 are sparse. Adequate use of antibiotics in line with antibiotic stewardship (ABS) principles is warranted during the pandemic. We performed a retrospective study of clinical and microbiological characteristics of 140 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 to a German University hospital, with a focus on bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial therapy. The final date of follow-up was 6 May 2020. Clinical data of 140 COVID-19 patients were recorded: The median age was 63.5 (range 17-99) years; 64% were males. According to the implemented local ABS guidelines, the most commonly used antibiotic regimen was ampicillin/sulbactam (41.5%) with a median duration of 6 (range 1-13) days.

To date, compliance of the Italian public with voluntary home quarantine has been very high, but little is known about the impact of psychological health on sociodemographic categories during the quarantine. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. In the very early stage of the nationwide lockdown, 3,672 quarantined Italian adult residents (65% females, ranging from 18 to 85 years) participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey, including measures of depressive symptoms, which were measured by the Teate depression inventory, and state anxiety levels. The overall prevalence was 27.8% for moderate and 9.3% for severe levels of depressive symptoms. A generalized logistic model was used to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. Among these factors, sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, employment status) and adherence to quarantine guidelines were analyzed. Females, younger people, students, singles, residents in northern Italy, people who were reluctant to adhere to quarantine guidelines, and people less worried about being infected with COVID-19 were at high risk of developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic, also after controlling for state anxiety. These findings showed that public levels of depressive symptoms did not increase the greater likelihood of being infected.

{"text": "Spatial modeling could not differentiate early SARS-CoV-2 cases from the distribution of humans on the basis of climate in the United States. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet, as a novel pathogen, knowledge of its biology is still emerging. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest at least some link between SARS-CoV-2 and weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, we believe climate's relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring, as it may have some impact on the distribution of cases. To further examine if there is a link to climate, we build model projections with raw SARS-CoV-2 case data and population-scaled case data in the USA. The case data were from across March 2020, before large travel restrictions and public health policies were impacting cases across the country. We show that SDMs built from population-scaled case data cannot be distinguished from control models (built from raw human population data), while SDMs built on raw case data fail to predict the known distribution of cases in the U.S. from March. The population-scaled analyses indicate that climate did not play a central role in early U.S. viral distribution and that human population density was likely the primary driver. We do find slightly more population-scaled viral cases in cooler areas. Ultimately, the temporal and geographic constraints on this study mean that we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread anywhere in the U.S. where governmental policy does not prevent spread.

Published articles addressing SARS-CoV2 transmission modes and risks, and infection control procedures required in the dental office to protect dental patients and health care providers were assessed. Also, clinical guidelines on the management of dental patients during the pandemic were reviewed. Result(s): The established modes of transmission of SARS-CoV2 appear to be through respiratory droplets and through close contact with either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In addition to standard precautions of infection control widely followed in dental practices, extra precautionary measures are needed to control the spread of this highly infectious disease. Dental treatment during the pandemic is limited to emergent and urgent cases after a meticulous patient risk assessment and dental needs are triaged to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission and avoid cross-contamination. Conclusion(s): Dentists should be aware of the recently updated knowledge about COVID-19 modes of transmission and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings. Effective management protocols to regulate droplet and aerosol contamination in the dental clinic should be implemented to deliver dental care in a safe environment.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Aldahlawi and Afifi.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "COVID toes: where do we stand with the current evidence?. BACKGROUND: Numerous of cases of chilblains have been observed, mainly in young subjects with no or mild symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The pathophysiology of these lesions is still widely debated and an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unconfirmed. OBJECTIVE(S): This paper focus on the unresolved issues about these COVID toes and in particular whether or not they are associated with COVID-19. ARGUMENTS: The temporal link between the outbreak of chilblains and the COVID-19 pandemic is a first suggests a link between the two events. Positive anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 immunostaining on skin biopsy of chilblains seem to confirm the presence of the virus in the lesions, but lack specificity and must be interpreted with caution. Conversely, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were negative in the majority of patients with chilblains. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be excluded, with relative certainty, even after accounting for possible lower immunization in mild/asymptomatic patients and for some differences in sensitivity/specificity between the tests used. Some authors hypothesize that chilblains could be the cutaneous expression of a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response. High production of IFN-I is suggested to be associated with early viral control and may suppress antibody response. However, the absence of other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms as observed in other interferonopathies raises unanswered questions. To date, a direct link between chilblains and COVID-19 still seems impossible to confirm. A more indirect association due to lifestyle changes induced by lockdown is a possible explanation. Improvement of chilblains when protective measures were adopted and after lifting of lockdown, support this hypothesis. CONCLUSION(S): Conflicting current evidence highlights the need for systematic and repeated testing of larger numbers of patients and the need for valid follow-up data that take into consideration epidemic curves and evolution of lockdown measures.Copyright \u00a9 2020.

Identification of risk factors for contracting and developing serious illness following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of paramount interest. Here, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all Danish individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 27 February 2020 and 30 July 2020, with a known ABO and RhD blood group, to determine the influence of common blood groups on virus susceptibility. Distribution of blood groups was compared with data from nontested individuals. Participants (29% of whom were male) included 473654 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (7422 positive and 466232 negative) and 2204742 nontested individuals, accounting for ~38% of the total Danish population. Hospitalization and death from COVID-19, age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and job status were also collected for confirmed infected cases. ABO blood groups varied significantly between patients and the reference group, with only 38.41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.30-39.50) of the patients belonging to blood group O compared with 41.70% (95% CI, 41.60-41.80) in the controls, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91) for acquiring COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. No specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available, though several antiviral drugs, are under investigation as treatment agents for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma transfusion that contain neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 has become the major focus. This requires mass screening of populations for these antibodies. While several countries started reporting population based antibody rate, its simple point estimate may be misinterpreted without proper estimation of standard error and confidence intervals. In this paper, we review the importance of antibody studies and present the 95% confidence intervals COVID-19 antibody rate for the Korean population using two recently performed antibody tests in Korea. Due to the sparsity of data, the estimation of confidence interval is a big challenge. Thus, we consider several confidence intervals using Asymptotic, Exact and Bayesian estimation methods. In this article, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all Asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all Exact methods and Jeffrey's method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method.

{"text": "Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies. As economic woes of the COVID-19 pandemic deepen, strategies are being formulated to avoid the need for prolonged stay-at-home orders, while implementing risk-based quarantine, testing, contact tracing and surveillance protocols. Given limited resources and the significant economic, public health and operational challenges of the current 14-day quarantine recommendation, it is vital to understand if more efficient but equally effective quarantine and testing strategies can be deployed. To this end, we developed a mathematical model to quantify the probability of post-quarantine transmission that varied across a range of possible quarantine durations, timings of molecular testing, and estimated incubation periods. We found that a 13-day quarantine with testing on entry, a nine-day quarantine with testing on exit, and an eight-day quarantine with testing on both entry and exit each provide equivalent or lower probability of post-quarantine transmission compared to a 14-day quarantine with no testing. We found that testing on exit from quarantine is more effective in reducing probability of post-quarantine transmission than testing upon entry. When conducting a single test, testing on exit was most effective for quarantines of six days or shorter, while testing on day six or seven is optimal for longer quarantines. Optimal timing of testing during quarantine will reduce the probability of post-quarantine transmission, as false-positive results become less likely, enabling case isolation. Based on 4,040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, an exit test 96 hours after the start of quarantine for an offshore oil rig population was demonstrated to identify all known asymptomatic cases that previously tested negative at entry, and-moreover-successfully prevented an expected seven or more offshore transmission events, each a serious concern for initiating rapid spread and a disabling outbreak in the close quarters of an offshore rig. This successful outcome highlights the importance of context-specific guidelines for the duration of quarantine and timing of testing that can minimize economic impacts, disruptions to operational integrity, and COVID-related public health risks.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Materials and methods. The analysis of the data of operative statistics presented on the sites of the governments of the regions where the incidence among children was considered within the period from April 22, 2020 to June 26, 2020, as well as the data of the Main non-staff experts in infectious diseases in children was performed. The inpatient medical documentation and the data of pathologicoanatomic investigation of children died due to COVID-19 were analyzed. Results. Prevalence of COVID-19 in children from various regions of the Russian Federation was from 1% to 8.6% in the structure of general disease incidence. The asymptomatic and mild forms of the disease which did not require hospitalization, were noted in 55-60% of the cases. 12 death cases associated with COVID-19 were registered for June 22, 2020. The analysis of 8 presented cases showed that 6 patients out of 8 died children were of the first half of the year of life (3 girls and 5 boys). In most cases the children were admitted to the hospital at the 8-12th day of the disease in severe and extremely severe condition due to pulmonary-cardiac insufficiency, six patients had fever up to 38-39degreeS, four patients had signs of consciousness depression. All children were diagnosed with community-acquired bilateral pneumonia according to the data of roentgenography, ultrasound investigation or computer tomography of the chest organs that did not always coincide with the intensity of respiratory syndrome. The direct cause of death was cardiac or pulmonary-cardiac insufficiency. Conclusion. The analysis of clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 with an unfavourable outcome in children revealed some difficulties in the interpretation of its role in thanatogenesis. The significance of comorbid pathologies in the development of unfavourable outcomes is doubtless.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Interregional public organization Association of infectious disease specialists of Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad region (IPO AIDSSPbR).

{"text": "Potential Cross-Reactive Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 From Common Human Pathogens and Vaccines. The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is particularly virulent in the elderly while children are largely spared. Here, we explored the potential role of cross-reactive immunity acquired from pediatric vaccinations and exposure to common human pathogens in the protection and pathology of COVID-19. To that end, we sought for peptide matches to SARS-CoV-2 (identity >= 80%, in at least eight residues) in the proteomes of 25 human pathogens and in vaccine antigens, and subsequently predicted their T and B cell reactivity to identify potential cross-reactive epitopes. We found that viruses subject to pediatric vaccinations do not contain cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2, precluding that they can provide any general protection against COVID-19. Likewise, common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and several herpesviruses are also poor or null sources of cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, discarding that immunological memory against these viruses can have any general protective or pathological role in COVID-19. In contrast, we found combination vaccines for treating diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis infectious diseases (DTP vaccine) to be significant sources of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DTP cross-reactive epitopes with SARS-CoV-2 include numerous CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes with broad population protection coverage and potentially neutralizing B cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Worldwide, children receive several DTP vaccinations, including three-four doses the first year of life and one at 4-6 years of age. Moreover, a low antigenic Tdap dose is also given at ages 9-14. Thereby, children may well be protected from SARS-CoV-2 through cross-reactive immunity elicited by DTP vaccinations, supporting testing in the general population to prevent COVID-19.

Aim of this prospective, multicenter, observational study was to investigate the incidence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound in consecutive patients admitted to three pulmonary medicine wards designated to care for patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia, with or without respiratory failure but not requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Consecutive patients admitted between March 27 and May 6, 2020 were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18-year-old or if compression ultrasound could not be performed for any reason. Patients were assessed at admission (t0) and after 7 days (t1). Major and non-major clinically relevant bleedings were recorded. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Two were excluded due to anatomical abnormalities that prevented compression ultrasound; sixty patients were retested at (t1). All patients were started on antithrombotic prophylaxis, unless therapeutic anticoagulation was required. Deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasound was observed in 2 patients (3%); one of them was later deemed to represent a previous episode. No new episodes were detected at t1. One major and 2 non-major clinically relevant bleedings were observed. In the setting of patients with COVID-related pneumonia not requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis is low and our data support not screening asymptomatic patients.

{"text": "Immunological imprint of COVID-19 on human peripheral blood leukocyte populations. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic that is now claiming many lives. Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients during disease but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID-19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID-19-convalescent patients. METHOD(S): We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples, and determined SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels against the S-protein, its RBD-subunit and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients who had mild disease approximately 10 weeks after infection (n=109) and healthy control subjects (n=98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters. RESULT(S): Even ten weeks after disease COVID-19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID-19 patients both CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ effector memory cells were higher, while CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Fever (duration, level) correlated with numbers of central memory CD4+ T cells and anti-S and anti-RBD, but not anti-NC antibody levels. Moreover, a \"young immunological age\" as determined by numbers of CD3+ CD45RA+ CD62L+ CD31+ recent thymic emigrants was associated with a loss of sense of taste and/or smell. CONCLUSION(S): Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leaves protracted beneficial (i.e., activation of T cells) and potentially harmful (i.e., reduction of neutrophils) imprints in the cellular immune system in addition to induction of specific antibody responses.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Pathological Aspects of COVID-19 as a Conformational Disease and the Use of Pharmacological Chaperones as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the seventh human coronavirus infectious disease, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, followed by its rapid spread globally (251,059 deaths, on May 5, 2020, by Johns Hopkins University). An early clinical report showed that fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, and myalgia were initial symptoms, with the development of pneumonia as the disease progressed. Increases in the level of serum liver enzymes, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I, and creatinine have been observed in severely ill patients, indicating that multiple organ failure had occurred in these cases. Lymphopenia and an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also observed. Although COVID-19 patients are administered glucocorticoid therapy to treat the excessive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the efficacy of this form of therapy is unclear. Viremia is observed in severe cases, suggesting that in addition to type II alveolar epithelial cells, many cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, renal tubular cells, neuronal cells, and lymphocytes, may be damaged. The improvement of survival rates requires elucidation of the mechanism by which cellular damage occurs during viral infection. Cellular therapy, along with organ support systems such as oxygen therapy, artificial ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis, as well as antiviral therapy, are required. Viral replication in infected host cells may perturb protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. Although an adaptive cellular response, i.e. the unfolded protein response, can compensate for the misfolded protein burden to some extent, continued viral proliferation may induce inflammation and cell death. Therefore, we propose that proteostasis dysfunction may cause conformational disorders in COVID-19. The application of pharmacological chaperone therapy to treat COVID-19 patients is additionally discussed.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Aoe.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In older children and adults, the aetiology is less clear, but the present state of our knowledge indicates that Norwalk-like viruses are one of the major causes.

Short and long term forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value.

Itolizumab is a first-in-class anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody that was initially developed for various cancers and was later developed and approved in India for treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in 2013. This drug is now being re-purposed for COVID-19. The potential utility of itolizumab in COVID-19, based on its unique mechanism of action in ameliorating cytokine release syndrome (CRS), was proposed first in Cuba with approval of a single-arm clinical trial and expanded access use. Subsequently, a phase II, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been conducted in 30 COVID-19 patients in India after receiving regulatory permission. Based on the results, the Indian drug regulatory agency recently approved itolizumab in July 2020 for 'restricted emergency use' for the treatment of CRS in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19.

Bacterial or virus co-infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in many studies, however, the knowledge on Aspergillus co-infection among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was limited. This literature review aims to explore and describe the updated information about COVID-19 associated with pulmonary aspergillosis. We found that Aspergillus spp. can cause co-infections in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe/critical illness. The incidence of IPA in COVID-19 ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation was the common complications, and the overall mortality was high, which could be up to 64.7% (n = 22) in the pooled analysis of 34 reported cases. The conventional risk factors of invasive aspergillosis were not common among these specific populations. Fungus culture and galactomannan test, especially from respiratory specimens could help early diagnosis. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common species causing co-infection in COVID-19 patients, followed by Aspergillus flavus. Although voriconazole is the recommended anti-Aspergillus agent and also the most commonly used antifungal agent, aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant Aspergillus is also possible. Additionally, voriconazole should be used carefully in the concern of complicated drug-drug interaction and enhancing cardiovascular toxicity on anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.

Background In the early months of 2020, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly from China across multiple countries worldwide. As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. Methods and findings Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 +/- 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 +/- 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. Conclusions Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Pinotti et al.

{"text": "Recommendations for the integral treatment of older adults with COVID-19. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, has reached Mexico and has brought serious consequences for the general population; a large number of sick people and a considerable number of deaths. Every day, a large number of academic writings are produced that bring case reports and treatment proposals; however, despite these great efforts, from the experience acquired in other countries, the information is still uncertain regarding any treatment that is effective to stop the advance of the pandemic. From these reports we have very valuable data, one of the most relevant is that the most affected people and in greater magnitude in terms of severity are older adults, and even more so if these people have comorbidity with chronic diseases of higher prevalence in our country: hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity, conditions that are particularly frequent among older Mexican adults. It is known that this age group has its own changes of aging and atypical forms of manifestation of the disease, as well as in the case of hospitalization, they require finer and constant care for the recovery of health; so, a review and consensus of existing information to offer these recommendations was made for the comprehensive care of older adults with COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Comunicaciones Cientificas Mexicanas S.A. de C.V..

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2-associated acute hemorrhagic, necrotizing encephalitis (AHNE) presenting with cognitive impairment in a 44-year-old woman without comorbidities: A case report. Objective: Rare disease Background: Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis (AHNE) is a rare manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. AHNE usually involves the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter. This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network. Case Report: A 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment. She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonicclonic seizure. Blood tests were non-informative. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytosis with normal protein and normal glucose but an elevated IgG index. After testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, she was administered steroids. Treatment was ineffective, and the patient died. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 is a potential central nervous system (CNS) pathogen, which may manifest as AHNE. These patients may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and frontal dysexecutive syndrome, with cognitive impairment being the presenting feature of neuro-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The patient described in this report is unique for acute-onset and isolated cognitive impairments due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of clinical or radiological respiratory manifestations. These findings may help in the early detection and diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19, especially among clinicians and neurologists working in areas of endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright \u00a9 Am J Case Rep, 2020.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Clinical features and prognosis of COVID-19 in people with spinal cord injury: a case-control study. Study design: Observational case-control study. Objective(s): Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals. Setting(s): The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups. All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group. Conclusion(s): This study does not support the supposed notion that COVID-19 could exhibit atypical clinical features or a worse evolution in the frail population of people with SCI.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Spinal Cord Society.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Lab: A Whistlestop Journey at a Tertiary Health Care Center. Purpose Right now, our world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has dramatically increased the number of suspected cases with an expanding geographical area. The rapid identification of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic contacts is the priority for clinical management and outbreak control. Suspected cases should be screened for the virus with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) under the guidance of laboratory experts. Materials and methods This manuscript details the process of the establishment of a COVID-19 lab, which is a medical college virology lab (Viral Research Diagnostic Lab), in less than a months' time. Detailed data of the tests were studied over the initial one month and reported. Results Within one and a half months of the start of the lab, 3196 tests were conducted, which caters to five adjoining districts in Western Odisha. These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (contacts with a travel history from affected areas), and six COVID-19 positive cases were detected. Conclusion Though the establishment of a COVID-19 lab in a short time is a challenge, it can be achieved through determination, teamwork, and support from the authorities.

{"text": "Anticipating the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak was first declared an international public health, and it was later deemed a pandemic. In most countries, the COVID-19 incidence curve rises sharply over a short period of time, suggesting a transition from a disease-free (or low-burden disease) equilibrium state to a sustained infected (or high-burden disease) state. Such a transition is often known to exhibit characteristics of \"critical slowing down.\" Critical slowing down can be, in general, successfully detected using many statistical measures, such as variance, lag-1 autocorrelation, density ratio, and skewness. Here, we report an empirical test of this phenomena on the COVID-19 datasets of nine countries, including India, China, and the United States. For most of the datasets, increases in variance and autocorrelation predict the onset of a critical transition. Our analysis suggests two key features in predicting the COVID-19 incidence curve for a specific country: (a) the timing of strict social distancing and/or lockdown interventions implemented and (b) the fraction of a nation's population being affected by COVID-19 at that time. Furthermore, using satellite data of nitrogen dioxide as an indicator of lockdown efficacy, we found that countries where lockdown was implemented early and firmly have been successful in reducing COVID-19 spread. These results are essential for designing effective strategies to control the spread/resurgence of infectious pandemics.

{"text": "Patient and Provider Perspectives of a New Prenatal Care Model Introduced in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials document the safety and efficacy of reduced frequency prenatal visit schedules and virtual visits, but real-world data are lacking. Our institution created a prenatal care delivery model incorporating these alternative approaches to continue safely providing prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate institutional-level adoption and patient and provider experiences with the COVID-19 prenatal care model., STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a single-site evaluation of a COVID-19 prenatal care model incorporating a reduced frequency visit schedule and virtual visits deployed at a suburban academic institution on March 20, 2020. We used Electronic Health Record data to evaluate institution-level model adoption, defined as changes in overall visit frequency and proportion of virtual visits in the three months before and after implementation. To evaluate the patient and provider experience with the COVID-19 model, we conducted an online survey of all pregnant patients (>20 weeks gestation) and providers in May 2020. Three domains of care experience were evaluated: 1) access, 2) quality and safety, and 3) satisfaction. Quantitative data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistics. Free-text responses coded by the three survey domains elucidated drivers of positive and negative care experiences., RESULTS: Following COVID-19 model adoption, average weekly prenatal visit volume fell by 16.1%, from 898 to 761 weekly visits, the average weekly proportion of prenatal visits conducted virtually increased from 10.8% (97/898) to 43.3% (330/761), and the average visit no-show rate remained stable (4.3% pre-implementation; 4.2%, post-implementation). Of those eligible, 74.8% (77/103) of providers and 15.0% (253/1690) of patients participated in the surveys. Patient respondents were largely white (180/253, 71.1%) and privately insured (199/253, 78.7%), reflecting the study site population. Rates of chronic conditions and pregnancy complications also differed from national prevalence. Provider respondents were predominantly white (44/66, 66.7%) and female (50/66, 75.8%). Most patients and almost all providers reported that virtual visits improved access to care (patients: 68.8%, 174/253; providers: 74/77, 96.1%). Over half of respondents (patients: 124/253, 53.3%; providers: 41/77, 62.1%) believed virtual visits were safe. Nearly all believed home blood pressure cuffs were important for virtual visits (patients: 213/231, 92.2%; providers: 63/66, 95.5%). Most reported satisfaction with the COVID-19 model (patients: 196/253, 77.5%; providers: 64/77, 83.1%). In free-text responses, drivers of positive care experiences were similar for patients and providers, and included perceived improved access to care through decreased barriers (e.g. transportation, childcare); perceived high quality of virtual visits for low-risk patients and increased safety during the pandemic; and improved satisfaction through better patient counseling. Perceived drivers of negative care experience were also similar for patients and providers, but less common. These included concerns that unequal access to virtual visits could deepen existing maternity care inequities, concerns that the lack of home devices (e.g. blood pressure cuffs) would impact care quality and safety, and dissatisfaction with poor patient-provider continuity and inadequate expectation-setting for the virtual visit experience., CONCLUSION: Reduced visit schedules and virtual visits were rapidly integrated into real-world care, with positive experiences for many patients and providers. Future research is needed to understand the health outcomes and care experience associated with alternative approaches to prenatal care delivery across more diverse patient populations outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, to inform broader health policy decisions.

{"text": "Displacement ventilation: a viable ventilation strategy for makeshift hospitals and public buildings to contain COVID-19 and other airborne diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has so far infected more than 31 million people around the world, and its impact is being felt by all. Patients with diseases such as COVID-19 should ideally be treated in negative pressure isolation rooms. However, due to the overwhelming demand for hospital beds, patients have been treated in general wards, hospital corridors and makeshift hospitals. Adequate building ventilation in hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease (Escombe et al. 2007 PLoS Med. 4; Escombe et al. 2019 BMC Infect. Dis. 19, 88 (doi:10.1186/s12879-019-3717-9); Morawska & Milton 2020 Clin. Infect. Dis. ciaa939. (doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa939)), to exit lockdown safely, and reduce the chance of subsequent waves of outbreaks. A recently reported air-conditioner-induced COVID-19 outbreak caused by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China (Lu et al. 2020 Emerg. Infect. Dis. 26) exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces. We argue that displacement ventilation (either mechanical or natural ventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals. Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoors, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out. We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation. This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans. We have also discussed and addressed the issue of the 'lock-up effect'. We provide guidelines for such mechanically assisted, naturally ventilated makeshift hospitals. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Emergency management at the health and security interface. The world has recently witnessed the global impact of natural disease outbreaks, such as those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and the lasting impact of the accidental spread of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom. Natural outbreaks, of both emerging and re-emerging diseases, can have significant impacts on local, national and regional communities. An effective response to these outbreaks relies heavily on the coordination of both public health and Veterinary Services to identify the signs, symptoms and patterns of disease quickly and respond accordingly. The future global risks related to infectious disease are influenced by several factors, including human migration, urban development, agricultural development and climate change. As technology advances, we are more aware of the potential risks associated with dual-use equipment and research (defined as equipment or research that can be used for legitimate as well as nefarious purposes), synthetic biology, the engineering of biological systems, and the evolving modus operandi of criminals and terrorist groups. The ability to detect natural, accidental or deliberate outbreaks and incidents will rely heavily on cross-agency communication, establishment of informationsharing platforms, development of joint investigative strategies, and recognition that effective response requires a strong health and security agency interface. Therefore, the management of a suspicious biological incident requires intersectoral and interregional cooperation employing a comprehensive approach which considers prevention, preparedness, response and recovery and identifies and considers the unique characteristics and requirements of the incident.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity. Understanding humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 COVID-19 patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed over 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Pre-existing antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, while only COVID-19 patients primarily recognized spike and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of CMV and HSV-1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males make greater SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.

{"text": "LI-RADS category 5 hepatocellular carcinoma: preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for early recurrence risk stratification after curative resection. OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in stratifying the risk of early recurrence in patients with LR-5 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by LI-RADS v2018 after curative resection., METHODS: Between July 2015 and August 2018, this study evaluated consecutive treatment-naive at-risk LR-5 HCC patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI examination within 2 weeks before curative resection. The Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictors of early recurrence. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates were analyzed and compared by using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests., RESULTS: Fifty-three of 103 (51.5%) patients experienced early recurrence. Three MRI findings were significantly associated with early recurrence: corona enhancement (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.116; p = 0.013), peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) (HR: 2.262; p = 0.007), and satellite nodule (HR: 2.777; p = 0.005). An additional risk factor was AFP level > 400 ng/mL (HR: 1.975; p = 0.016). Based on the number of MRI predictors, LR-5 HCC patients were stratified into three subgroups: LR-5a (60/103; no predictor), LR-5b (26/103; one predictor), and LR-5c (17/103; two or three predictors), with low, medium, and high risk of early recurrence, respectively. The 2-year DFS rate of LR-5a, LR-5b, and LR-5c patients was 65.0%, 38.5%, and 5.9%, respectively, while the corresponding median DFS was undefined, 17.1 months, and 5.1 months, respectively (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In at-risk LR-5 HCC patients, corona enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, and satellite nodule could be used to preoperatively stratify the risk of early recurrence after hepatectomy., KEY POINTS: * Corona enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, satellite nodule, and serum AFP level > 400 ng/mL were significant predictors of early recurrence in patients with LR-5 HCC after hepatectomy. * Based on the number of predictive MRI findings, LR-5 HCC patients could be preoperatively stratified into three subgroups: LR-5a, LR-5b, and LR-5c, with significantly different risk of early recurrence and disease-free survival. * Preoperative risk stratification is essential for the identification of patients at increased risk of postoperative early recurrence, which may contribute to risk-based personalized management for LR-5 HCC patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
