0	Serological Profile of Children and Young Adults with at Least One SARS-CoV-2 Positive Cohabitant: An Observational Study. At the end of 2019, a new disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan Province in China. Children seemed to be infected less frequently than adults, and family clusters seemed to play an important role in the spread of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the serological profile of children and young adults between 4 and 16 years of age in order to assess the transmission patterns of COVID-19 between cohabitants. The subjects lived with at least one cohabitant who tested positive for the disease using a nasopharyngeal swab. To avoid contact with the disease, families were interviewed by telephone. Forty-nine children and adolescents with a mean age of 11 years were then subjected to a rapid lateral flow chromatographic test. Of them, seven (14.3%) were immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive, and four (8.2%) were immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive. In total, 16.3% of the tested sample had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: this may confirm the lower vulnerability of children to COVID-19, despite the small sample size. The time from the negativization of the cohabitant until the test day may have influenced the results, especially when this timeframe is wide.	included

0	Nationwide Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia. <h4>Background: </h4> Estimated seroprevalence of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a critical evidence for a better evaluation of the virus spread and monitoring the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic in a population. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods:</h4> A total of 11703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates Results: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population. Interpretation: Our study estimates the overall national serological prevalence of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to be 11%, with an apparent disparity between regions.	included

0	SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent infection risk in healthy young adults: a prospective cohort study. <h4>Background: </h4> The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subsequent infection among seropositive young adults was studied prospectively. <h4>Methods:</h4> The study population comprised 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits. Upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine, participants were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of the quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, we performed three biweekly PCR tests in both seropositive and in seronegative groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training and baseline neutralizing antibody titers on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants. Findings: Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10.1%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the six-week follow-up (1.1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1,079 (48.0%) of the 2,247 seronegative participants tested positive (6.2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11-0.28, p<0.00001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was associated with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titers (p<0.0001). Compared with seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits had about 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p<0.005), and trended towards shorter duration of PCR positivity (p=0.18) and more frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralizing titers were detected in 45 of 54 (83.3%) uninfected and in 6 of 19 (31.6%) infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<.0001). Interpretation: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings may be relevant for optimization of mass vaccination strategies.	included
0	"Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies in Southern Italy's hospital staff. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Respiratory/aerial droplets transmission and the high number of ""hidden"" asymptomatic cases play a critical role in the rapid spread of the virus across countries. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population is currently unknown. It has been estimated that undocumented infections were the source for #80% of the documented cases before traveling restriction policies took place. Serological evaluation is essential for investigating the extent of SARS-CoV-2. Even more, assessing the prevalence of anti-SARSCoV-2 in hospital staff offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and at higher risk of contagious. Method(s): The study enrolled a total of 3242 employees of our hospital, ""Policlinico Riuniti"" of Foggia. The employees' group was stratified in 3 subgroups according to their relative exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high, intermediate, and low-risk groups). We used a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech) to study the seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies (IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid and spike proteins). The cut-off was set to 8 AU/mL for both IgG and IgM (specificity of 98,8% and 100%, respectively). A control group of 83 samples sera collected before the Italian COVID-19 outbreak (2018-19) was also tested. Healthcare workers with IgG or IgM concentration above 6.0 and below 8.0 AU/mL were considered borderline. Nevertheless, all of them were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA presence (AllplexTM 2019 n-CoV Assay, Seegene). Result(s): Sixty-two individuals (1.9%, 1.4-2.3%, 95% CI) tested positive for at least one antibody anti-SARS-CoV-2. Five individuals (8.0% of the positive) had IgG and IgM positive test results, while 32 and 25 had only IgG and only IgM positive results. Instead, viral RNA was detected in only nine individuals (13.8% of Ig positive) by RTPCR. The cumulative proportion of individuals who tested positive (IgG and/or IgM) varied between 1-2.4%. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428,0.5-2.6%, 95% CI) vs. intermediate-risk group 2.0 % (55/2736, 1.5-2.5%, 95% CI). Only one participant (1.3%, 0-3.8%, 95% CI) of the low-risk group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Conclusion(s): The low level of seropositivity (1.9%) shows that the COVID-19 containment measures adopted were adequate and effective. Moreover, the combination of both serological and molecular tests can improve the likelihood of identifying asymptomatic subjects."	included
0	HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection: cross-sectional findings from a German 'hotspot'. PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the proportion of people living with HIV with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a sample from a large single HIV center in Munich, Germany, after the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic and to infer the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in people living with HIV., METHODS: Prospective sub-study of the ongoing ArcHIV cohort between May and July 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany); positive and borderline results were re-tested using the recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany). Demographic and medical data were extracted from the electronic patient files., RESULTS: Overall, 500 people living with HIV were included in the study (83% male, median age 51 years). Three participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to study inclusion. Of those, nine were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, resulting in an estimated seroprevalence (accounting for sensitivity and specificity of the test) of 1.5% (CI 95%: 0.69; 3.13) for the entire study sample, and 2.2% (CI 95%: 1.1; 3.9) for the subset of the Munich citizens. There were no marked differences for people living with HIV with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection., CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in people living with HIV as found in our study does not seem to exceed previous reports from general populations of 'hot-sport' areas; comparative data from the Munich population can be expected to be published soon. Our data also highlight, once more, the need to do confirmatory testing on positive samples to minimize the impact of false-positive results.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey estimates are affected by anti-nucleocapsid antibody decline. We analyzed 21,676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected between March-August, 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates. Testing specimens orthogonally using the Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and then the Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (p=0.015), and the GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (p=0.0018). The association between the two tests decreased each month (p<0.001), suggesting anti-N antibody decline. Lowering the Abbott antibody index cut-off from 1.4 to 0.7 resulted in a 16% increase in positive specimens. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

0	Seropositivity in blood donors and pregnant women during 9-months of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Stockholm, Sweden. <h4>Structured abstract</h4> <h4>Objectives</h4> As Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults – here represented by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the country’s most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of population seropositivity in response to natural infection. <h4>Design</h4> In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors ( n= 2,100) and pregnant women ( n= 2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three intervals) between 14 th March and 11 th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large cohort of historical controls ( n= 595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807. <h4>Setting</h4> Healthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random through the Karolinska University Hospital. <h4>Participants</h4> None of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the samples. <h4>Results</h4> Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened ( n= 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B cell response. <h4>Conclusions</h4> In agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. <h4>General abstract</h4> Public health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world. In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women ( n= 4,100) were sampled at random between 14 th March-11 th December 2020. All individuals ( n= 200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results were compared with those from historical controls ( n= 595). Data were modelled using a probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11 th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9 months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the end of 2020.	included

0	"SARS-COV-2 Serological Profile in Healthcare Professionals of a Southern Italy Hospital. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first coronavirus that has caused a pandemic. Assessing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker groups offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and a higher risk of contagion. The study enrolled 3242 asymptomatic employees of ""Policlinico Riuniti"", Foggia. After the first screening, we collected sequential serum samples for up to 23 weeks from the same subjects. In order to perform a longitudinal follow-up study and get information about the titration of IgG levels, we analyzed data from subjects (33) with at least two consecutive serological IgG-positive tests; 62 (1.9%; 95% CI: 1.4-2.3) tested positive for at least one anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428; 95% CI: 0.5-2.6) vs. the intermediate-risk group 2.0% (55/2736; 95% CI: 1.5-2.5). Overall, within eight weeks, we detected a mean reduction of -17% in IgG levels. Our data suggest a reduction of about 9.27 AU/mL every week (R2 = 0.35, p = 0.0003). This study revealed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Foggia's hospital healthcare staff (1.9%). Moreover, the IgG level reduction suggests that the serological response fades fast in asymptomatic infections."	included

0	Decline in SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies After Mild Infection Among Frontline Health Care Personnel in a Multistate Hospital Network - 12 States, April-August 2020. Most persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), develop virus-specific antibodies within several weeks, but antibody titers might decline over time. Understanding the timeline of antibody decline is important for interpreting SARS-CoV-2 serology results. Serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline health care personnel at 13 hospitals and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 during April 3-June 19, 2020, and again approximately 60 days later to assess this timeline. The percentage of participants who experienced seroreversion, defined as an antibody signal-to-threshold ratio >1.0 at baseline and <1.0 at the follow-up visit, was assessed. Overall, 194 (6.0%) of 3,248 participants had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (1). Upon repeat testing approximately 60 days later (range = 50-91 days), 146 (93.6%) of 156 participants experienced a decline in antibody response indicated by a lower signal-to-threshold ratio at the follow-up visit, compared with the baseline visit, and 44 (28.2%) experienced seroreversion. Participants with higher initial antibody responses were more likely to have antibodies detected at the follow-up test than were those who had a lower initial antibody response. Whether decay in these antibodies increases risk for reinfection and disease remains unanswered. However, these results suggest that serology testing at a single time point is likely to underestimate the number of persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a negative serologic test result might not reliably exclude prior infection.	included
0	Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave. BACKGROUND: We aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in the general population of the Netherlands and identify risk factors for seropositivity amidst the first COVID-19 epidemic wave., METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2-90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18-39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2-17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported. This study identified independent groups with increased odds for seropositivity that may require specific surveillance measures to guide future protective interventions internationally, including vaccination once available.

0	Searching for COVID-19 Antibodies in Czech Children-A Needle in the Haystack. During the COVID-19 pandemics of 2020, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), both adults and children were shown to mount a specific antibody response to the virus. As infected children often exhibit mild symptoms or even remain asymptomatic, they are likely to be under tested for the direct presence of the virus. Mapping the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies frequency informs more accurately on the disease prevalence and helps guide the protective and therapeutic strategies. To date, only few seroprevalence studies included children. In the Czech Republic, in April 2020, the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was estimated not to exceed 1.3%. In July and August, 2020, we screened 200 children (0-18 years of age), who attended the pediatric department of a large hospital in Prague for various COVID-19-unrelated reasons, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Zero seropositive subjects were found. Therefore, we hereby report a low (<0.5%) seroprevalence amongst children in Prague, as of August, 2020.© Copyright © 2020 Bloomfield, Pospisilova, Cabelova, Sediva, Ibrahimova, Borecka and Magner.	included
0	Seroprevalence of Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at a Community Hospital Emergency Department and Outpatient Laboratory in Northern Orange County, California. INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 20 million people worldwide, and the spread is most prevalent in the USA, where California had accounted over 240,000 cases in the initial 5 months of the pandemic. To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing., RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08-0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8-4.1), p < 0.0001., CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine. The Hispanic/Latino patient population should be considered for increased education on preventing transmission and acquisition of COVID-19 as well as being considered as a priority for vaccination once a vaccine is available.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test as a Diagnostic Tool in Hospitalized Patients and Healthcare Workers, at a large Teaching Hospital in northern Italy, during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic. We describe the outcome of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) IgG/IgM rapid test, and discuss the potential suitability of antibody testing. Retrospective single cohort study on patients with suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic Healthcare Workers, enrolled from March to April 2020. Subjects had quantitative PCR (qPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab and serological testing using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay. Some subjects underwent chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) after rapid test. The aim of the study was to analyse the proportion of those who developed a positive IgM/IgG response for SARS-CoV-2. The correspondence between the results from rapid testing and CLIA, when available, was evaluated. 97 subjects underwent qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 through nasal swab, which resulted positive in 40/43 (93.0%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of asymptomatic HCW, in no subjects with suspected COVID-19 (clinical and radiological findings) then excluded by repeated nasal swabs and alternative diagnosis (COVID-19-negative patients, CNPs), and in 6/6 (100%) of patients with confirmed diagnosis and negative follow-up nasal swabs (COVID-19-recovered patients, CRPs). IgM resulted positive in 8/43 (18.6%) of symptomatic patients and in 1/6 (16.7%) of CRPs. IgG resulted positive in 36/43 (83.7%) of symptomatic patients, 2/40 (5%) of HCW, and in 1/8 (12.5%) and 6/6 (100%) of CNPs and CRPs, respectively. A comparison between an IgG/IgM Rapid Test and a following CLIA test showed consistency in negative results in 25/28 of HCW and 8/8 of CNPs tested. Our preliminary data support the role of IgG/IgM Rapid Test (PRIMA Lab SA) immunochromatographic assay as a point-of-care test that may complement molecular tests in the screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers. The test may gain particular relevance in shortening the time needed to refer patients to a COVID or non-COVID Hospital area and to achieve diagnosis in patients with persistently negative nasal swabs.	included
0	SARS-COV-2 HERD IMMUNITY, INFECTIVE AND NAIVE INCIDENCE IN FERTILITY CLINICS AFTER PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN. A MULTICENTER STUDY. Objective: COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March, 2020 and lockdown was imposed to a third of the world's population. Now, determining the transmission potential and immune status among sheltering in place asymptomatic patients and clinical staff resuming their activity is crucial. Here, we report herd immunity, infective, and naive incidence for SARS-CoV-2 after the lockdown period, among asymptomatic medical personnel and patients in two US ART centers located in states with different COVID19 incidences. Design(s): Prospective multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466644). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 339 asymptomatic individuals (personnel and patients) were analyzed from June 18 to July 30, 2020 in two ART centers reopening after lockdown following CDC safety guidelines. In Clinic A (Utah Fertility Center), located in a low prevalence State (312 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 154 individuals were analyzed. In clinic B (Boston IVF), in a high prevalence scenario (Massachusetts, 1,462 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 185 individuals were tested. Asymptomatic individuals attending or working in the indicated clinics were tested by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and for IgG quantification on blood samples (Abbott Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), following FDA-Emergency Use Authorization protocols. IRB approval was obtained from WIRB Protocol #20201490. Result(s): From 339 asymptomatic individuals tested, the percentage of non-informativity was 0 for RT-PCR and 0.6% (2 out of 339) for the IgG test. Only those individuals with informative results for both tests (n= 337) are presented. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): In the population investigated, our results suggest that the impact of the pandemic is far from reaching the level required to achieve herd immunity (i.e., 50% of a population). Therefore, transmission remains a risk since potential infectivity is present in 0.6% of the asymptomatic population tested. This figure was maintained despite their different geographical locations and the adherence to CDC guidelines of the IVF clinics involved. Interestingly, the two PCR+ individuals were IgG + suggesting virus persistence or reinfection that, if tested by serology alone, would be considered immune. These results together with the high incidence of naive individuals draws attention for the implementation of a consistent program of testing for COVID19 as a means of preventing reemerging outbreaks in our fertility centers.Copyright © 2020	included

0	BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over one million deaths worldwide, thus there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs)., METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion., RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion., CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection., FUNDING: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (U54 CA26059) and the Erika J.

0	Observational study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody immune response in a cohort of patients at a North Suburban Chicago, Illinois, in a physician's practice. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. The application of point of care serological testing can help determine past infection and assist healthcare workers assess patient risk. Method: An observational study of 114 subjects in North Suburban Chicago, Illinois, was performed using the Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). Patients' PCR test results and clinical symptoms were used to compare the seroconversion rate of this patient population with the surrounding community. Results: Excluding 1 aberrant result, there was 100% positive agreement (10) between PCR and antibody (IgG or IgM) test results. There were 7 patients who did not have a prior PCR test who were positive for IgG; 5 of the 7 had clinical symptoms consistent with possible exposure and 2 were asymptomatic. There was 1 person with a suspected exposure to an infected person who was IgM positive. Ninety-five asymptomatic patients were seronegative. The overall rate of 15.9% seroconversion (IgG or IgM) is consistent with other community-based testing results in the North Suburban Chicago, Illinois area. Conclusion: Rapid screening tests to identify antibody positive patients recovered from coronavirus disease-2019 can be a useful tool for healthcare professionals to determine or confirm past infection. Statement of novelty: Limited data is available on the use of point of care serological testing to assist healthcare professionals with the assessment of their patient population regarding past SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and seroconversion. The present study successfully investigated the use of a point of care antibody test in a physician's office to determine which patients have developed antibodies, indicating an immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and to assist with decisions on whether patients should pursue normal social and workplace activities.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and their neonates represent two vulnerable populations highly susceptible to viral infections with an interdependent immune system. The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied., OBJECTIVES: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates., STUDY DESIGN: Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welch's two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welch's two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels., RESULTS: Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies. Copyright © 2021.

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children from a cohort of 2192 patients. Background: As of 18 June 2020 a total of 187,764 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were reported in Germany and of these 6.9% were under the age of 19 years. There were initial indications that children are often asymptomatic and show a milder clinical course. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to gain information on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a pediatric cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 13 March and 18 June 2020 all children from whom a smear for SARS-CoV-2 was taken either to rule out an infection or as a suspected case were included. Data were collected on standardized patient record sheets. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Result(s): During the given period 2192 children were investigated and 37 patients tested positive (1.7%) for SARS-CoV-2. Of these 36/37 were suspected cases and 28/37 were symptomatic. The leading symptoms were dry cough, runny nose and fever and three children had to be hospitalized. None showed a difficult course of the disease. Among those tested 505 were patients at risk due to an underlying chronic disease, 3 of whom (0.6%) were tested positive with an asymptomatic or mild course. Conclusion(s): We can confirm the first data showing that children and adolescents often have an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of infection or disease. We found no evidence of a high grey area of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this regional pediatric cohort.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	included

Current SARS-CoV-2 shedding was associated in multivariable analyses with attained only primary or lower educational levels (RR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.99-1.76), speaking an indigenous language at home (RR=1.30; 0.97-1.73), working in the fields (RR=1.60; 1.03-2.50), and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 case at home (RR=2.98; 2.06-4.32) or in the workplace (RR=1.59; 1.18-2.14). Antibody detection was associated with residential exposures including living in crowded housing (RR=1.23; 0.98-1.53), with children (RR=1.40; 1.1-1.76) or unrelated roommates (RR=1.40; 1.19-1.64), and with a known or suspected COVID-19 case (RR=1.59; 1.13-2.24). Those who were obese (RR=1.65; 1.01-2.70) or diabetic (RR=1.31; 0.98-1.75) were also more likely to be seropositive. Farmworkers who lived in rural areas other than Greenfield (RR=0.58; 0.47-0.71), worked indoors (RR=0.68; 0.61-0.77), or whose employer provided them with information on how to protect themselves at work (RR=0.59; 0.40-0.86) had lower risk of prior infection. <h4>Conclusions and Relevance</h4> Our findings suggest both residential and workplace exposures are contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California. Urgent distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is warranted given this population’s increased risk of infection and the essential nature of their work.	included
0	Characterization of SARS-COV-2 antibody titers in over 16,000 blood and plasma donations. Background: Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are believed to have a Spike protein specificity, specifically to the Receptor Binding Domain of Subunit 1 (S1- RBD). The correlation between donor demographics and antibody titers is not presently known. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference in neutralizing antibody titers based on donor demographics to include: age, race, and gender. Method(s): Blood donors were screened utilizing a commercial qualitative assay and subsequently reflexed to a quantitative laboratory developed test (LDT) utilizing a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD protein. The LDT is a total immunoglobulin kinetic-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA). The k-ELISA utilized a standard curve created from a pool of 100 CCP donors to calculate a titer by testing a single dilution of each specimen. Testing was performed on donations collected from 30 March 2020 to 29 September 2020. The results were grouped by age, race, and gender for evaluation. The one-way ANOVA test with Dunnett comparison was used to evaluate differences of the mean of each group compared to the mean of all donors. Result(s): There were 16,153 donations tested. The mean titer of all donations was 1208. Males (n. 7,989) had a statistically significantly higher mean titer of 1347 (P < 0.0001), whereas Females (n.8,156) had a lower mean titer of 1,072 (P < 0.0001), there were 8 donors who did not provide a gender and were excluded from evaluation in the gender category. Hispanic donors (n. 3,838) had statistically higher mean titer of 1,373 (P < 0.0001) and Caucasian donors (n.10,900) had a lower mean titer of 1,149 (p<0.0192), whereas African American donors (n.746) did not have a statistically significant mean titer of 1,193 (P = 0.9988). Donors in the age groups of 16-19, 20-29, and 30-39 had significantly (P <= 0.0003) lower mean titers of 869, 828, and 904 respectively. Donors between the age of 40-49 did not have a significantly different mean titer of 1,202 (P = 0.9998). Lastly, donors in the age groups of 50-59, 60-69, and >=70 had mean titers of 1,433, 1,623, and 1,708 respectively, all which were statistically higher than the overall population (P < 0.0001). Summary/Conclusions: There was no difference from the mean titer for African American donors or donors 40-49 years of age. Donors that are Caucasian, under the age of 40, or female were more likely to have a lower titer. Hispanics, donors over the age of 50, or males were more likely to have higher titers.	included
0	Antibody response to SARS-COV-2 within healthcare workers: A single-center study in Kazakhstan. The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak was reported in December 2019, and the virus has rapidly spread worldwide. The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. In the period from the end of June to July in Kazakhstan, there was a sharp increase in the incidence. Present study aimed to evaluate the incidence rate and the development of immune response among healthcare workers during the height of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in Kazakhstan. The prospective study was carried out on the basis of the Syzganov National Scientific Center of Surgery in the period from July 2020 to August 2020. The project involved 248 people. In total, there were 50 men and 198 women under study, aged 21 to 80 years, with the average age of men being 43.3 +/- 0.2 years, women - 37.4 +/- 0.3 years. The total percentage of antibody detection was 11.7% (29 participants). The largest percentage of the development of an immune response was among junior medical personnel IgG was detected in 10 (4%)Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in 1 (0.4%), while among the middle and senior medical personnel IgG and IgM was 7 (2.8%) and 1 (0.4%), respectively. Antibodies were not detected among paraclinical and technical personnel. Of the 29 seropositive results, IgG was detected in 24, IgM in 3, and IgG + IgM in 2, respectively. The presence of immune response among medical personnel, a significant percentage of infection was in clinical personnel compared to paraclinical and technical personnel. The majority of subjects with a seropositive result had an asymptomatic course.Copyright © 2020, Yerevan State Medical University. All rights reserved.	included
0	Seroprevalence and seroconversion rates to SARS-CoV-2 in interns, residents, and medical doctors in a University Hospital in Bogota, Colombia. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the incidence of seroconversion in the first month of follow-up among interns, residents, and medical doctors attending patients at a University Hospital in Bogota (Colombia). Design or methods: A cross-sectional and a prospective study were performed during June, July, and August 2020 to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates using CLIA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLIA IgG. Result(s): At baseline, 8 (2.28% 95%CI 1.16-4.43%) participants were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLIA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98% 95%CI 3.94-8.97%) individuals seroconverted by CLIA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLIA and of these 11 (3.13% 95%CI 1.76-5.52%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLIA IgG had moderate concordance (>962 samples) with LFA IgG and ELFA IgM, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusion(s): Our report is the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. The relatively high rate (>3%) of asymptomatic health care workers with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection underscores the need to screen this population for infection to prevent infection/disease spread.Copyright © 2021 Asociacion Colombiana de Infectologia.

0	Serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers of a tertiary care teaching institution in Central Kerala during the post lockdown phase. <h4>Background: </h4> Kerala was the first state to have the confirmed case of COVID 19 in the country and it was first confirmed in Thrissur district on 30 January 2020.Our institute being in the heart of the city had to take adequate measures to mitigate the spread and treat the required patients by keeping its staff safe & healthy. The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital. Aim: To estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown Methodology: A cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020 Results: Jubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 423 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID 19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23 to 11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> The overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.

0	The importance of anosmia, ageusia and age in community presentation of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Louisiana, USA; a cross-sectional prevalence study. Objective: While many seroprevalence studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been performed, few are demographically representative. This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. Method(s): A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. Result(s): Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4 +/- 0.9, mean +/- SD), highly symptomatic (7.5 +/- 1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0 +/- 1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3 +/- 8.3 versus 17.3 +/- 9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. Conclusion(s): Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms. Regular testing in congregant settings of those over age 60 years may help mitigate asymptomatic spread.Copyright © 2021 The Authors	included
0	Citywide serosurveillance of the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in San Francisco. Serosurveillance provides a unique opportunity to quantify the proportion of the population that has been exposed to pathogens. Here, we developed and piloted Serosurveillance for Continuous, ActionabLe Epidemiologic Intelligence of Transmission (SCALE-IT), a platform through which we systematically tested remnant samples from routine blood draws in two major hospital networks in San Francisco for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the early months of the pandemic. Importantly, SCALE-IT allows for algorithmic sample selection and rich data on covariates by leveraging electronic medical record data. We estimated overall seroprevalence at 4.2%, corresponding to a case ascertainment rate of only 4.9%, and identified important heterogeneities by neighborhood, homelessness status, and race/ethnicity. Neighborhood seroprevalence estimates from SCALE-IT were comparable to local community-based surveys, while providing results encompassing the entire city that have been previously unavailable. Leveraging this hybrid serosurveillance approach has strong potential for application beyond this local context and for diseases other than SARS-CoV-2.	included
0	SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the healthcare setting into the home: a prospective longitudinal cohort study. <h4>Objective: </h4> To assess the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in healthcare workers and subsequent transmission to their close contacts within their household. To assess changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) and neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in exposed participants. Setting Two acute National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within the East Midlands region of England. Background The UK has been one of the most severely affected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission from healthcare workers to the wider community is a potential major vector for spread of SARS-CoV-2 which is not well described in the current literature. Methods Healthcare workers (HCW) were recruited from two Hospitals within the East Midlands of England and underwent serial blood sampling for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both nucleocapsid and spike protein for IgG, IgM and IgA) between 20 April and 30 July 2020, with the presence of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) assessed for positive participants. Cohabitees of the volunteers were invited to attend testing in July -August 2020 and underwent identical serological testing as the HCWs. Results 633 healthcare professionals were recruited. 178 household contacts of 137 professionals volunteered for the study. 18% of healthcare professionals (115 out of 633) tested as seropositive during the study period, compared to an estimated seroprevalence of 7% within the general population. The rate of symptomatic COVID-19 was 27.5% compared to an asymptomatic rate of 15.1%. Rates of positivity declined across the study period for all immunoglobulins (overall positivity from 16.7% to 6.9%). 7.2% of the cohabitees tested as seropositive. 58 cohabitees lived with a serologically positive HCW; this group had a seropositive rate of 15.5%, compared to 2.5% of cohabitees without a seropositive HCW, a six-fold increase in risk (Odds ratio 7.16 95% CI 1.86 to 27.59), p = 0.0025). Given the observed decay rates and data from Public Health England, we estimate that the proportion of seropositive cohabitees living with a seropositive HCW at the height of the first wave could have been as high as 44%. 110 out of 115 (95.7%) HCWs and 12 out of 13 (92.3%) cohabitees who tested positive developed detectable nAbs. 56.5% (65 out of 115) of SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs developed a neutralising titre with an IC50 1/300 dilution; no cohabitee achieved this level. Conclusions Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare professionals and their home contacts appears to be a significant factor of viral transmission, but, even accounting for the decline in seropositivity over time, less than 44% of adult cohabitees of seropositive healthcare workers became seropositive. Routine screening and priority vaccination of both healthcare professionals and their close contacts should be implemented to reduce viral transmission from hospitals to the community.	included

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in a university student population. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional survey study based on the World Health Organization population-based seroepidemiological investigational protocol for SARS-CoV-2 conducted between April 29, 2020, and May 8, 2020, examining SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among 790 university students in Los Angeles, CA. Participants completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors before blood sampling. Samples were analyzed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) for the qualitative detection of IgG class antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum or plasma. RESULT(S): The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 4.0% (3.0%, 5.1%). Factors associated with having a positive test included history of anosmia and/or loss of taste (95% CI: 1.4-9.6). A history of respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, was not associated with a positive antibody test. CONCLUSION(S): Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the undergraduate and graduate student university population was similar to community prevalence.Copyright © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

0	SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among a southern U.S. population indicates limited asymptomatic spread under physical distancing measures. Characterizing the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was aimed at determining asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a suburban, Southern U.S. population during a period of state restrictions and physical distancing mandates. This is one of the first published seroprevalence studies from North Carolina and included multicenter, primary care, and emergency care facilities serving a low-density, suburban and rural population since description of the North Carolina state index case introducing the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen to this population. To estimate point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals over time, two cohort studies were examined. The first cohort study, named ScreenNC, was comprised of outpatient clinics, and the second cohort study, named ScreenNC2, was comprised of inpatients unrelated to COVID-19. Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 (with no clinical symptoms) was examined using an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved antibody test (Abbott) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This assay as performed under CLIA had a reported specificity/sensitivity of 100%/99.6%. ScreenNC identified 24 out of 2,973 (0.8%) positive individuals among asymptomatic participants accessing health care during 28 April to 19 June 2020, which was increasing over time. A separate cohort, ScreenNC2, sampled from 3 March to 4 June 2020, identified 10 out of 1,449 (0.7%) positive participants. IMPORTANCE This study suggests limited but accelerating asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic infections, like symptomatic infections, disproportionately affected vulnerable communities in this population, and seroprevalence was higher in African American participants than in White participants. The low, overall prevalence may reflect the success of shelter-in-place mandates at the time this study was performed and of maintaining effective physical distancing practices among suburban populations. Under these public health measures and aggressive case finding, outbreak clusters did not spread into the general population.Copyright © 2020 Barzin et al.	included

0	Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies monitoring in a group of residents in a long term care facility during COVID-19 pandemic peak. Clinical laboratories plays a key role in screening, diagnosis and containment of the Coronavirus 2019 infection epidemic. The etiological diagnosis presupposes the isolation of virus genetic material in the patient's biological sample but laboratory diagnostics also make use of searching possibility for IgG, IgM classes antibodies. The characteristics of the antibody response are not yet completely clear. This study describes a serological monitoring of subjects, elderly nursing care residence guests, interested by a very large infection outbreak. After first nasopharyngeal swab, all the positive subjects (43) were monitored for the persistence of the virus infection through nasopharyngeal swab after 20 days (16-24), 32 days (28-36) and after 49 days (47-50). At the same time, during the second (day 32) and third (day 49) follow up, all the guests were investigated for IgM and IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, by using a quantitative chemiluminescence method. Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative. The comparison of the levels of IgG-Ab between the controls shows a significant decrease in concentrations (-10%). Our study confirms that in most patients affected by COVID-19 there is a typical antibody response with IgG-Ab present in 90% of nursing care COVID-19 positive residence guests. For IgM-Ab only 23% of tested subjects were positive on the 32nd and 49th day of illness, always in parallel with the IgG-Ab positivity.Copyright © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

0	Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline health care workers in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. INTRODUCTION: As an emerging infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout worldwide. Health care workers (HCWs) on frontline directly participated in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of COVID-19 patients are at high risk of getting infected with the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, a total of 222 medical staff went to Wuhan city for support. In this study, we aimed to determine any nosocomial infection among our cohort of HCWs who worked in Wuhan., METHODS: Throat swab samples were obtained for RNA testing on day 1 and 14 of their quarantine upon their return to Nanjing. Radiological assessments were performed by chest computed tomography (CT) on day 14 of their quarantine. The blood was collected from 191 HCWs between May 12 and May 15. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody responses were determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay., RESULTS: All the throat swab specimens were found negative for SARS-CoV-2. The radiological analysis revealed that there was no typical chest CT scan of COVID-19 among 222 HCWs. Consistently, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG was also found to be negative among 191 HCWs., CONCLUSIONS: There was no nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 among our cohort of the frontline HCWs, suggesting that zero occupational infection is an achievable goal with appropriate training, strict compliance, and psychological support for the frontline HCWs.

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Children and Adults with Type 1 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE As diabetes is a risk factor for severe symptoms, hospitalization, and death with COVID-19 disease, we aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children and adults people with and without type 1 diabetes in Colorado during 2020. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We developed a highly sensitive and specific test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and measured the antibodies in people children and adults with new-onset (n=129) and established type 1 diabetes (n=94) seen for routine diabetes care at our Center between January and October, 2020. The antibodies were also measured in 562 children and 102 adults from the general population of Colorado. RESULTS The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in persons with new-onset type 1 diabetes (0.8%; 95% CI 0.1-4.2%) or those with established disease (4.3%; 1.7-10.4%) did not differ from that in the general population children (2.8%; 1.8-4.6%) or adults (3.9%; 1.5-9.7%). In a subset of individuals with positive antibodies (n=31), antibodies remained positive for up to 9 months, although the levels decreased starting 3 months after the infection (p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS From January to October 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different in persons children and adults with and without type 1 diabetes in Colorado. We found no evidence for increased prevalence of COVID-19 infections among youth with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.	included

0	Seroprevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Among VA Healthcare System Employees Suggests Higher Risk of Infection When Exposed to SARS-CoV-2 Outside of the Work Environment. OBJECTIVE: The seroprevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) IgG antibody was evaluated among employees of a Veterans Affairs Healthcare System to assess potential risk factors for transmission and infection., METHODS: All employees were invited to participate in a questionnaire and serological survey to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 M protein as part of a facility-wide quality improvement and infection prevention initiative regardless of clinical or non-clinical duties. The initiative was conducted from June 8 to July 8, 2020., RESULTS: Of the 2900 employees, 50.9% participated in the study, revealing a positive SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence of 4.9% (72/1476), [95% CI of 4.04% - 5.89%]. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of antibody based on gender, age, frontline worker status, job title, performance of aerosol generating procedures or exposure to known patients with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the hospital. Employees who reported exposure to a known COVID-19 case outside of work had a significantly higher seroprevalence at 14.84% (23/155) compared to those that did not 3.70% (48/1296), OR 4.53 [95% CI 2.67-7.68] p<0.0001. Notably, 29% of seropositive employees reported no history of symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 among employees was not significantly different among those who provided direct patient care and those who did not, suggesting facility-wide infection control measures based were effective. Employees who reported direct personal contact with COVID-19 positive persons outside of work were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Employee exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outside of work may introduce infection into hospitals.	included
0	Comparison of serologic and molecular SARS-CoV 2 results in a large cohort in Southern Tuscany demonstrates a role for serologic testing to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Background: Since February 2019, Italian hospitals registered COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19) cases more often than the rest of the Europe. During this epidemic, health authorities requested swab tests, while seeking new patient paths. Method(s): A dual laboratory approach was evaluated, consisting of patient care reports for viral RNA detection on swabs and rapid serological tests in 516 patients (192 symptomatic or paucisymptomatic and 324 asymptomatic). Result(s): We found the molecular positive fraction equal to 12% (23/192) among symptomatic/paucisymptomatic (S/P) and 15.4% (50/324) in asymptomatic (As) sets. Among subsets, we observed serologically positive results, corresponding to 35% (8/23) for S/P and 38% (19/50) for As. Among molecular negative cases, we detected specific Immunoglobulin G or M (Ig G or Ig M) positivity in the S/P cohort equal to 6.6% (11/167) and 6% (15/246) in As cases. For indeterminate molecular results, we found S/P serological positivity equal to 100% (1/1) and 54% (13/24) in As patients. We found higher (p < 0.05) seropositivity in older patients (n = 8) among symptomatic and positives for viral RNA (n.23). Conclusion(s): It has been observed that a dual approach of serological and molecular tests detects a higher absolute number of disease cases in a pandemic context,which could improve monitoring and health surveillance efficacy. The age-related seropositivity frequency in this study, if confirmed, could enhance the validity of serological tests, especially in older patients.In these subjects, molecular positivity accompanied by serological positivity (distinct for M and G immunoglobulins) should help determine disease status and support decisions related to patient management.Copyright © 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists	included

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers of a gastroenterological service in a tertiary care facility. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Frontlines healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are at increased risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in Egypt. This study aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs providing gastroenterological services., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four HCWs at the gastroenterological service of Al-Manial University Hospital, the main hospital of the largest tertiary university hospitals complex in Egypt (Kasr Al-Ainy Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University) were tested using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples, and rapid serological IgM/IgG tests (RST). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic, occupational and clinical data., RESULTS: Of the 74 HCWs, 10 tested positive by RT-PCR (13.5%). In 9/74 (12.2%) HCWs, antibodies could be detected by RST: three with both IgM and IgG lines; six with IgM line only and none with IgG line only. Frequency of positive tests was more among subjects with minor symptoms compared to completely asymptomatic HCWs (50% vs 16.1%, respectively). Neither age, gender or occupation was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in gastroenterology HCWs is 13.5% by RT-PCR. Continued measures are warranted to assure HCWs safety and reduce transmission from healthcare settings to the community during COVID-19 pandemic. Presence of positive test results among asymptomatic HCWs illustrates the importance of screening all HCWs irrespective of symptoms. Copyright © 2020 Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology.

0	Screening of SARS-CoV-2 in 299 Hospitalized Children with Hemato-oncological Diseases: A Multicenter Survey in Hubei, China. The SARS-CoV-2 infection status of hospitalized children was surveyed in the department of pediatric hematology and oncology in three different hospitals of epidemic areas in Hubei, China. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics, lung CT scan, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and serum antibodies of hospitalized children with hemato-oncological diseases from January 23 to April 24, 2020. 299 children were enrolled in this study, including 176 males (58.9%) and 123 females (41.1%), aged from 2 months to 16 years. 255 cases (85.3%) received chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapies, and there were 44 cases (14.7%) of other benign diseases. Nucleic acid test was performed on 258 children (86.3%) and one case was positive. 163 cases (54.5%) were tested for serum antibodies, and all of them were negative. Lung CT scan was performed on 247 children (82.6%), and 107 of them showed infectious changes. Only one case (0.33%) of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the group. The prevalence rate of COVID-19 in enrolled children with hemato-oncological diseases in Hubei was 0.33%. Immunosuppressed patients are not prone to produce related antibodies. Comprehensive protective measures and ward management can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the group patients.	included

0	SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Serologic Responses from a Sample of U.S. Navy Service Members - USS Theodore Roosevelt, April 2020. Compared with the volume of data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks among older adults, relatively few data are available concerning COVID-19 in younger, healthy persons in the United States (1,2). In late March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt arrived at port in Guam after numerous U.S. service members onboard developed COVID-19. In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity. This report improves the understanding of COVID-19 in the U.S. military and among young adults in congregate settings and reinforces the importance of preventive measures to lower risk for infection in similar environments.	included

0	Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence in Boise, Idaho. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Bryan et al.	included

0	Search for asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers during the pandemic: a Spanish experience. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 can be a vehicle for transmission of the infection. This fact is of particular importance in the case of healthcare workers (HCWs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study in HCWs in a medium size hospital in the South of Spain. METHOD(S): between April 15 and 25, 2020, naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography to the HCWs of the Costa del Sol Hospital in Marbella of the units involved in patient care with CoVID-19: Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. RESULT(S): 498 HCWs were studied. Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive. Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected. CONCLUSION(S): the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among health workers of the services directly involved in the care of patients with CoVID-19 was very low in our center. This type of strategy can be one more tool in controlling the pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Physicians.

0	[Diagnostics and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children : season 2]. Some uncertainties remain regarding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic procedures and seroprevalence studies in children. RT-PCR assays conducted on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic in children as in adults. Saliva samples might replace soon NP swabs as similar sensitivities have been reported from both samples in adults, but not yet in children. Rapid antigen testing is currently performed on NP swabs collected from children within 4 days of their symptom onset. Serology testing is an essential diagnostic tool in seroprevalence studies, which might guide in the future public health decisions.	false
0	"Distinct antibody repertoires against endemic human coronaviruses in children and adults. Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans. B cell responses to these ""common cold"" viruses remain incompletely understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2' cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design."	false

0	COVID-19 testing in outbreak free care homes: What are the public health benefits?. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 care home outbreaks represent a significant proportion of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the UK. National testing initially focused on symptomatic care home residents, before extending to asymptomatic cohorts., AIM: The aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in outbreak free care homes., METHODS: A two-point prevalence survey of COVID-19, in 34 Liverpool care homes, was performed in April and May 2020. Changes in prevalence were analysed. Associations between care home characteristics, reported infection, prevention and control interventions, and COVID-19 status were described and analysed., FINDINGS: No resident developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study. There was no significant difference between: the number of care homes containing at least one test positive resident between the first (17.6%, 95%CI 6.8-34.5) and second round (14.7%, 95%CI 5.0-31.1) of testing (p>0.99); and the number of residents testing positive between the first (2.1%, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and second round (1.0%, 95%CI 0.5-2.1) of testing (p=0.11). Care homes providing nursing care (RR 7.99, 95%CI 1.1-57.3) and employing agency staff (RR 8.4, 95%CI 1.2-60.8) were more likely to contain test positive residents. Closing residents shared space was not associated with residents testing positive (RR 2.63, 95%CI 0.4-18.5)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 care homes showed no evidence of disease transmission or development of outbreaks; suggesting that current infection prevention and control measures are effective in preventing transmission. Repeat testing at 2-3 weeks had limited or no public health benefits over regular daily monitoring of staff and residents for symptoms. These results should inform policies calling for regular testing of asymptomatic residents. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Antibody Profiling of COVID-19 Patients in an Urban Low-Incidence Region in Northern Germany. A vast majority of COVID-19 cases present with mild or moderate symptoms. The study region is in an urban and well-defined environment in a low-incidence region in Northern Germany. In the present study, we explored the dynamics of the antibody response with respect to onset, level and duration in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were detected by automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients monitored by the Health Protection Authority. This explorative monocentric study shows IgA and IgG antibody profiles from 118 patients with self-reported mild to moderate, or no COVID-19 related symptoms after laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. We found that 21.7% and 18.1% of patients were seronegative for IgA or IgG, respectively. Clinically, most of the seronegative patients showed no to only moderate symptoms. With regard to antibody profiling 82% of all patients developed sustainable antibodies (IgG) and 78% (IgA) 3 weeks or later after the infection. Our data indicate that antibody-positivity is a useful indicator of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Negative antibodies do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies are needed to determine the functionality of the antibodies in terms of neutralization capacity leading to personal protection and prevention ability to transmit the virus as well as to protect after vaccination.	false

0	Sensitivity and specificity of lateral flow antigen test kits for covid-19 in asymptomatic population of quarantine centre of province 3. Background Nearly after 6 months of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 19, along with the world Nepal is still trying to control the spread and prevent general population from acquiring it. With limited resources in manpower, technology and evidence it has been a difficult battle. But with time and more understanding of the virus new technology to detect the virus are coming up. It is a major breakthrough in the diagnostic field as this helps us in not only detecting the virus but also helps us to mobilize our human resources. This comes in a time where the cases are increasing at an alarming rate. Although numbers of Polymerase Chain Reaction testing have increased but due to the time consuming and the cost wise, we need a faster and equally reliable alternative. Antigen test approved by different countries can be used for point of care, screening and surveillance depending upon the requirements after calculating its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Objective To find out sensitivity and specificity of the Antigen test kit for COVID-19. Method Antigen tests were compared with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction as a reference standard in calculated sample size of 113 subjects in a high risk population. Both Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and antigen test were performed in a same subject with in maximum of 2 days' interval. Convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. Ethical approval was taken from Nepal Health Research Council before data collection. Study was done from August to September 2020 from Quarantine center of Province 3. Result There were total of 113 test carried out, among those 47 were positive and 66 were negative in Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. After preparing two by two table, Sensitivity and specificity of the tested was calculated which came out to be 85% and 100% respectively, with accuracy of 93.80%. Conclusion Even though the sensitivity and specificity came to be higher, this test should be interpreted cautiously depending upon the prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 19 in that particular community and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested. When in doubt by clinical correlation should be confirmed with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.Copyright © 2020, Kathmandu University. All rights reserved.	false
0	Prevalence of COVID-19 in Ohio Nursing Homes: What's Quality Got to Do with It?. With nursing homes being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to know whether facilities that have any cases, or those with particularly high caseloads, are different from nursing homes that do not have any reported cases. Our analysis found that through mid-June, just under one-third of nursing homes in Ohio had at least one resident with COVID-19, with over 82% of all cases in the state coming from 37% of nursing homes. Overall findings on the association between facility quality and the prevalence of COVID-19 showed that having any resident case of the virus or even having a high caseload of residents with the virus is not more likely in nursing homes with lower quality ratings.	false

0	Mass Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in 16 Prisons and Jails - Six Jurisdictions, United States, April-May 2020. Preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in correctional and detention facilities* can be challenging because of population-dense housing, varied access to hygiene facilities and supplies, and limited space for isolation and quarantine (1). Incarcerated and detained populations have a high prevalence of chronic diseases, increasing their risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and making early detection critical (2,3). Correctional and detention facilities are not closed systems; SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted to and from the surrounding community through staff member and visitor movements as well as entry, transfer, and release of incarcerated and detained persons (1). To better understand SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in these settings, CDC requested data from 15 jurisdictions describing results of mass testing events among incarcerated and detained persons and cases identified through earlier symptom-based testing. Six jurisdictions reported SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 0%-86.8% (median = 29.3%) from mass testing events in 16 adult facilities. Before mass testing, 15 of the 16 facilities had identified at least one COVID-19 case among incarcerated or detained persons using symptom-based testing, and mass testing increased the total number of known cases from 642 to 8,239. Case surveillance from symptom-based testing has likely underestimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities. Broad-based testing can provide a more accurate assessment of prevalence and generate data to help control transmission (4).	false

0	COVID-19 in a state of Brazilian Northeast: prevalence and associated factors in people with flu-like syndrome. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors to COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceara-Brazil. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ceara. The capital of the Ceara State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHOD(S): 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analyzed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases, and Down's syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULT(S): The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes. CONCLUSION(S): among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVD-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceara State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavorable prognosis of the disease.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

0	Most chilblains observed during the COVID-19 outbreak occur in patients who are negative for COVID-19 on PCR and serology testing. INTRODUCTION: Acral lesions, mainly chilblains, are the most frequently reported cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. In more than 80% of tested patients, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was launched on March 30, 2020 by the French society of dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations., RESULTS: We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations (58.5% females, median age 25.7 years [range 18-39]). The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms, and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains (n= 26/29). Twelve patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Ten patients were positive among the 150 (48%) who were tested (RT-PCR and/or serology). Seven of 121 RT-PCR-tested patients were positive and 5 of 75 serology-tested patients were positive (IgG) among them RT-PCR and serology were both positive for two patients. Seven of 121 RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (6%), and 5 of 75 serology-tested patients had IgG anti- SARS-CoV-2 (7 %). Tested and untested patients or those with and without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral-lesion clinical characteristics., CONCLUSION: The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains but found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France.

0	SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in an asymptomatic cancer cohort - results and consequences for clinical routine. BACKGROUND: Starting in December 2019, the current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confronts the world with an unprecedented challenge. With no vaccine or drug being currently available to control the pandemic spread, prevention and PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) testing becomes a crucial pillar of medical systems. Aim of the present study was to report on the first results of the measures taken in a large German Department of Radiation Oncology, including PCR testing of asymptomatic cancer patients., METHODS: Pandemic-adapted hygiene regulations and prevention measures for patients and staff were implemented. A visiting ban on both wards was implemented from the beginning and medical staff and patients were required to wear face masks at all times. The waiting rooms were rearranged to ensure distance between patients of at least 1.5 m. Clinical follow up was mainly done by telephone and all patients had to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms and contacts with COVID-19 patients before entering our department. Educational documents were created for patients to raise awareness of symptoms and avoidance strategies for interactions with other people. Indications for therapy and fractionation schemes were adapted when possible. In a subsequent step, all new asymptomatic patients were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at our screening station shortly before their simulation CT., RESULTS: All these measures and implementations have been well accepted semiquantitatively measured by the consent received from patients and staff. Regarding the PCR testing, only 1 out of 139 asymptomatic patients of our cohort so far tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, reflecting a prevalence of 0.72% in this cancer patient population. Up to this point no staff members was tested positive. The start of the treatment for the PCR-positive patient was deferred for 2 weeks., CONCLUSION: Due to the pandemic-adapted implementations, our department seems well prepared during this crisis. The initial screening helps to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in order to protect other patients and our staff from infection and the observed PCR prevalence is in line with comparable studies. A regular PCR testing (e.g. twice a week) of all patients and staff would in principle be desirable but is limited due to testing capacities at present.	false

0	Universal SARS-Cov-2 Screening in Women Admitted for Delivery in a Large Managed Care Organization. OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a need for data regarding the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women. After implementing universal screening for COVID-19 in women admitted for delivery, we sought to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 in this large cohort of women., STUDY DESIGN: An observational study of women admitted to labor and delivery units in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) hospitals between April 6 and May 11, 2020 who were universally offered testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 3,963). Hospital inpatient and outpatient physician encounter, and laboratory records were used to ascertain universal testing levels, test results, and medical and obstetrical histories. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated from the number of women who tested positive during labor per 100 women delivered., RESULTS: Of women delivered during the study period, 3,923 (99.0%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. A total of 17 (0.43%; 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.63%) women tested positive, and none of them were symptomatic on admission. There was no difference in terms of characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative tested women. One woman developed a headache attributed to COVID-19 3 days postpartum. No neonates had a positive test at 24 hours of life., CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in pregnant women admitted for delivery between April 6 and May 11, 2020 in this large integrated health care system in Southern California, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 test positive was very low and all patients were asymptomatic on admission., KEY POINTS: . The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large diverse cohort of term pregnant women was 0.43%.. . 99% of women accepted SARS-CoV-2 screening on admission to labor and delivery.. . All women with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing.. Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false
0	Hospital affiliated long term care facility COVID-19 containment strategy by using prevalence testing and infection control best practices. In a hospital affiliated long term care facility, we found an opportunity to interrupt a potential outbreak of COVID-19 using a point prevalence testing containment strategy and applying infection prevention and control best practices. Three serial point prevalence studies were conducted on all residents and employees in fourteen day intervals and percent positive was used as marker for effective infection control efforts. A multidisciplinary strike team from acute care was used to disseminate infection control education and support to long term care partners. These results highlight the need for swift identification and action in congregant high risk settings to prevent rapid spread and large scale outbreaks of COVID-19. Copyright © 2020.

0	The new coronavirus that came from the East: analysis of the initial epidemic in Mexico. INTRODUCTION: As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics. METHOD(S): Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic. RESULT(S): Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported. Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe. CONCLUSION(S): In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.	false

0	Spatial analysis of global variability in covid-19 burden. Background: Since the first occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a number of online tools have become available to assist with tracking Covid-19 prevalence. Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. Method(s): We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. Result(s): The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population. Conclusion(s): Countries with a high Covid-19 prevalence may not have a high incidence, and vice versa. Public health agencies that provide real-time infection tracking tools should report country-specific Covid-19 incidence metrics, in addition to prevalence data.Copyright © 2020 Miller et al.	false

0	COVID-19 Among Workers in Meat and Poultry Processing Facilities - 19 States, April 2020. Congregate work and residential locations are at increased risk for infectious disease transmission including respiratory illness outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).	false
0	Biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus COVID-19. The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to the international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R-2 = 0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.

0	Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Comparison of three automatic chemiluminescent immunoassays for monitoring dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. BACKGROUND: Seldom performance evaluation and diagnosis comparison studies were reported for different chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) kits approved under an emergency approval program for SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A total of 100 and 105 serum separately from non-infected populations and COVID-19 patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. The characteristics including precision, functional sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy were evaluated for Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi CLIA kits., RESULTS: Maglumi and iFlash had the best analytical sensitivity for IgM and IgG, respectively. Axceed kits had a linearity response in the detected concentration. The clinical sensitivity of Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi was 68.0%, 64.9%, and 63.9% with a specificity of 99.0%, 96.0%, and 100% for IgM, 85.6%, 97.9%, and 94.8% with a specificity of 97.0% for IgG. ROC analysis indicated all kits had a diagnostic power greater than 0.9. Notably, either IgM or IgG kits obtained a poor agreement (Kappa value from 0.397 to 0.713) with others. Among 38 recovered patients, 94.7% had an effective immune response, and both seropositive IgM and IgG accounted for the biggest proportion (medium, 42 days onset), then followed by the single seropositive IgG (medium, 50 days onset) in Ab profile., CONCLUSION: The performance of CLIA kits satisfied the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both positive of IgG and IgM contributes to improve the specificity, and a positive one will enhance the sensitivity. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Geography of COVID-19 in Denmark. Aim: To investigate the COVID-19 situation across geographical areas of Denmark over time. Methods: We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time. Conclusion: COVID-19 had affected eastern Denmark, especially the Capital Region, considerably more than western Denmark. The difference may relate to population density and housing conditions. 	false

0	Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers up to six months post disease onset. SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a human pathogen, causing clinical signs, from fever to pneumonia - COVID-19 - but may remain mild or asymptomatic. To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed. We quantified immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 onset. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 198 post-COVID-19 volunteers. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses follow a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce subsequently, the ability to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies remained robust with confirmed neutralisation activity for up to six months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

0	Comparative Analysis of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children. Introduction: In this study, a comparison of clinical, epidemiological and laboratory parameters between symptomatic and asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed. Materials and Methods: Data from all children with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), Singapore, from January to May 2020 were analysed. Results: Of the 39 COVID-19 children included, 38.5% were asymptomatic. Household transmission accounted for 95% of cases. The presenting symptoms of symptomatic children were low-grade fever (54.2%), rhinorrhoea (45.8%), sore throat (25%), diarrhoea (12.5%) and acute olfactory dysfunction (5.4%). Children of Chinese ethnicity (37.5% vs 6.7%), complete blood count (45.8% vs 6.7%) and liver enzyme abnormalities (25% vs 7.7%) were more common in symptomatic versus asymptomatic children. All children had a mild disease course and none required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Conclusions: The high proportion of asymptomatic infected children coupled with household transmission as the main source of paediatric COVID-19 infection underscores the importance of early screening and isolation of children upon detection of an index case of COVID-19 in a household. Symptomatic children were more likely to have abnormal laboratory parameters but they did not have a poorer outcome compared to asymptomatic cases.	false
0	Serological cross-reaction and co-infection of dengue and COVID-19 in Asia: Experience from Indonesia. Similar symptoms and laboratory findings between dengue and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose a diagnostic challenge in some dengue-endemic countries in Asia. In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue co-infection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results on dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 co-infection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Co-infection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using NS1 antigen serology test. This case was the first case of dengue and COVID-19 co-infection in Indonesia and at the same time revealed possible cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DENV antibodies based on rapid serological tests. Our study shall raise public health concern for COVID-19 and dengue detection in Indonesia as well as in other dengue-endemic countries as it may present a tip of the dangerous iceberg for the nations' effort to manage of both pathogens.

0	COVID-19 Among American Indian and Alaska Native Persons - 23 States, January 31-July 3, 2020. Although non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons account for 0.7% of the U.S. population,* a recent analysis reported that 1.3% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported to CDC with known race and ethnicity were among AI/AN persons (1). To assess the impact of COVID-19 among the AI/AN population, reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 22 -July 3, 2020 were analyzed. The analysis was limited to 23 states with >70% complete race/ethnicity information and five or more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among both AI/AN persons (alone or in combination with other races and ethnicities) and non-Hispanic white (white) persons. Among 424,899 COVID-19 cases reported by these states, 340,059 (80%) had complete race/ethnicity information; among these 340,059 cases, 9,072 (2.7%) occurred among AI/AN persons, and 138,960 (40.9%) among white persons. Among 340,059 cases with complete patient race/ethnicity data, the cumulative incidence among AI/AN persons in these 23 states was 594 per 100,000 AI/AN population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 203-1,740), compared with 169 per 100,000 white population (95% CI = 137-209) (rate ratio [RR] = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2-10.1). AI/AN persons with COVID-19 were younger (median age = 40 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 26-56 years) than were white persons (median age = 51 years; IQR = 32-67 years). More complete case report data and timely, culturally responsive, and evidence-based public health efforts that leverage the strengths of AI/AN communities are needed to decrease COVID-19 transmission and improve patient outcomes.	false

0	Coronavirus infection in patients with diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is a complex, multifactorial, chronic disease characterized by impaired metabolism of glucose, fats and proteins. Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality. In this review article we have focused on four specific points: 1) epidemiology of the prevalence and mortality of COVID 19 in the general population and in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) pathophysiology related to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors in subjects with diabetes; 3) the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, and 4) the outpatient and hospital treatment recommended in patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.

0	Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers during a period of diminished community prevalence of COVID-19. Previously, we showed that 3% (31/1032)of asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) from a large teaching hospital in Cambridge, UK, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020. About 15% (26/169) HCWs with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Rivett et al., 2020). Here, we show that the proportion of both asymptomatic and symptomatic HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 rapidly declined to near-zero between 25th April and 24th May 2020, corresponding to a decline in patient admissions with COVID-19 during the ongoing UK 'lockdown'. These data demonstrate how infection prevention and control measures including staff testing may help prevent hospitals from becoming independent 'hubs' of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and illustrate how, with appropriate precautions, organizations in other sectors may be able to resume on-site work safely.

0	Laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in India: Performance of testing & descriptive epidemiology of detected COVID-19, January 22 - April 30, 2020. Background & objectives: India has been reporting the cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since January 30, 2020. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person., Methods: The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events., Results: Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases., Interpretation & conclusions: The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts. Analysis of the data indicates that for further insight, additional surveillance tools and strategies at the national and sub-national levels are needed.	false
0	The urgency of conducting serological studies for COVID-19. Background: COVID-19 has been the most priority of the world since the early 2020s. We aimed to investigate the importance, urgency and value of serological tests for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. Study design: Rapid review. Method(s): This study was conducted through a review of seroepidemiological studies to evaluate their strength and weakness in monitoring and predicting the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Result(s): Conducting serological studies is an important measure to determine the status of the COVID-19 in affected countries. These studies may also be used to estimate cumulative incidence of the disease, and to get an impression about the level of the epidemic. Conclusion(s): If an accurate serological test is available it can be used for seroepidemiological studies and epidemic investigation in special context, but given the current situation, it may not be possible to be used for screening the normal population and in care and treatment. This research highlighted the importance and urgency of conducting serological studies for monitoring the COVID-19 situation and evaluation of the interventions.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

0	"Covid-19 epidemic in Italy: evolution, projections and impact of government measures. We report on the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy in relation to the extraordinary measures implemented by the Italian Government between the 24th of February and the 12th of March. We analysed the Covid-19 cumulative incidence (CI) using data from the 1st to the 31st of March. We estimated that in Lombardy, the worst hit region in Italy, the observed Covid-19 CI diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7-10 days after the measures implementation. The Covid-19 CI growth rate peaked in Lombardy the 22nd of March and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of March. The CI growth rate peaked in 87 out of 107 Italian provinces on average 13.6 days after the measures implementation. We projected that the CI growth rate in Lombardy should substantially slow by mid-May 2020. Other regions should follow a similar pattern. Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period. The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave. Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions. As several governments indicate that their aim is to ""push down"" the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s)."	false
0	Test, test, test for COVID-19 antibodies: the importance of sensitivity, specificity and predictive powers. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests of varying specificity and sensitivity are now available. For informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they need to be very accurate. For measuring population prevalence of past infection, the numbers of false positives and negatives need to be roughly equal. With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed. Giving false reassurance on which personal or societal decisions might be based could be harmful for individuals, undermine public confidence and foster further outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health	false

0	An Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Within a Skilled Nursing Facility Using Heat Maps. OBJECTIVES: To illustrate dissemination and asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a skilled nursing facility (SNF) outbreak. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULT(S): The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION(S): Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.Copyright © 2020 The American Geriatrics Society	false
0	A familial cluster of infection associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating possible person-to-person transmission during the incubation period. An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was reported in China. It is unclear whether the virus is infective exists during the incubation period, although person-to-person transmission has been reported elsewhere. We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 patients in Shanghai, including an 88-year-old man with limited mobility who was exposed only to asymptomatic family members whose symptoms developed later. The epidemiological evidence has shown possible transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus during the incubation period.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Age-Dependent Risks of Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and Other Parts of China. The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Wang, Zhong, Bao, Li, Liu, Wang and He.	false

0	Characteristics of Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Confirmed using an IgM-IgG Antibody Test. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly developed into a pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019. Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

0	SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity after infection and antibody response to mRNA-based vaccination. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity on the immune response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has not been well-described. Here we report longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses pre- and post-vaccination among a cohort of healthcare personnel, with and without prior infection, from a large academic medical center. Our results provide preliminary evidence that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may prime the response to the first mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. These findings could have significant impact on the allocation of mRNA-based vaccines and support the need for future research into the effect of prior infection on magnitude and durability of vaccination response.	false
0	Immunodeficiency during COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of a 243 patients' cohort followed at a Brazilian tertiary hospital. Rationale: COVID-19 pandemic raised doubts about susceptibility and disease prognosis of immunodeficient patients compared to general population. Our objective was to evaluate these patients' profile and their evolution during pandemic. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 243 immunodeficientpatients' medical records from March-July 2020. We evaluated socioeconomic conditions, adherence to social distancing, symptoms and type of immunodeficiency and comorbidities. Diagnosis was established through symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Result(s): Most were women (58%), mean age 42.3y. The majority presented CVID (48.2%), followed by IgA deficiency (14.8%), agammaglobulinemia (4.1%). Some presented secondary immunodeficiency (14.4%). Comorbidities: bronchiectasis (22.6%), asthma (20.2%), COPD (9.5%), SAH (17.7%), obesity (14%), diabetes (7.8%) and cardiovascular diseases (5%). COVID-19 was confirmed in 10(4.1%) patients, of which 55.6% had positive IgG. About housing, 94.2% lived in the city, 72% in houses, with an average of 6.3 rooms and 3.1 residents/household. During pandemic, patients left home on average 7 times/month and 93.4% usedmask, 63.4% used their own car, 23.9% used public transport. Those infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a higher mean of visitors compared to total cohort(2.4x1.4), lived more in apartments (50%x27.6%),left home more often (8.8x7,0 times/month) and were more obese (60% x14%) Conclusion(s): Lower percentage of immunodeficient patients infected with COVID-19 (4.1%) was observed compared to that in general population of the city of Sao Paulo (11%), possibly due to greater isolation and fear of being contaminated. Those infected were less adherent to preventive measures and had higher incidence of comorbidities (obesity) related to worse prognosis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Cardiac arrhythmias amongst hospitalised Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients: Prevalence, characterisation, and clinical algorithm to classify arrhythmic risk. Objectives: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients may have cardiac involvement including arrhythmias. Although arrhythmia characterisation and possible predictors were previously reported, there are conflicting data regarding the exact prevalence of arrhythmias. Clinically applicable algorithms to classify COVID patients' arrhythmic risk are still lacking, and are the aim of our study. Method(s): We describe a single-centre cohort of hospitalised patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 during the initial Israeli outbreak between 1/2/2020 and 30/5/2020. The study's outcome was any documented arrhythmia during hospitalisation, based on daily physical examination, routine ECG's, periodic 24-hour Holter, and continuous monitoring. Multivariate analysis was used to find predictors for new arrhythmias and create classification trees for discriminating patients with high and low arrhythmic risk. Result(s): Out of 390 COVID-19 patients included, 28 (7.2%) had documented arrhythmias during hospitalisation, including 23 atrial tachyarrhythmias, combined atrial fibrillation (AF), and ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia storm, and 3 bradyarrhythmias. Only 7/28 patients had previous arrhythmias. Our study showed a significant correlation between disease severity and arrhythmia prevalence (P <.001) with a low arrhythmic prevalence amongst mild disease patients (2%). Multivariate analysis revealed background heart failure (CHF) and disease severity are independently associated with overall arrhythmia while age, CHF, disease severity, and arrhythmic symptoms are associated with tachyarrhythmias. A novel decision tree using age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels was created to stratify patients into high and low risk for developing arrhythmia. Conclusion(s): Dominant arrhythmia amongst COVID-19 patients is AF. Arrhythmia prevalence is associated with age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels. A novel simple Classification tree, based on these parameters, can discriminate between high and low arrhythmic risk patients.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false
0	Resuming professional football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates: a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The risk of viral transmission associated with contact sports such as football (soccer) during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the infective and immune status of professional football players, team staff and league officials over a truncated football season resumed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country with high infection rates and to investigate the clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 infection in professional football players., METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1337 football players, staff and officials during a truncated football season (9 weeks) with a tailored infection control programme based on preventive measures and regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing (every 3-5 days) combined with serology testing for immunity (every 4 weeks). Clinical symptoms in positive participants were recorded using a 26-item, Likert-Scale-based scoring system., RESULTS: During the study period, 85 subjects returned positive (cycle threshold (cT) <=30) or reactive (30<cT<40) PCR tests, of which 36 were players. The infection rate was consistent with that of the general population during the same time period. More than half of infected subjects were asymptomatic, and the remaining had only mild symptoms with no one requiring hospitalisation. Symptom severity was associated with lower cT values. Social contacts and family were the most common sources of infection, and no infection could be traced to training or matches. Of the 36 infected players, 15 presented positive serology during the study period., CONCLUSION: Football played outdoors involving close contact between athletes represents a limited risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness when preventive measures are in place.

0	“Evaluation of a COVID-19 IgM and IgG Rapid Test and Assessment of Specific Antibody Response in COVID-19 patients, Tunisia 2020”. <h4>Background: </h4> COVID-19 pandemic is a massive global health emergency. Although RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosing suspected cases, there is a need of serological tests to investigate antibody responses. Many serologic immunoassays have been developed to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV2, including rapid tests. This study assessed the clinical performance of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (colloidal gold immunochromatography, LEPU TECHNOLOGY) and evaluated the kinetic antibody response in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Methods: </h4> Samples collected by finger stick; obtained from RT-PCR confirmed cases and samples of negative controls were tested with the IgM/IgG Detection Kit . <h4>Results: </h4>: The kit shows a clinical sensitivity of 65.7 % [59.7%-71.3%] and a specificity of 96.3% [93.0%-98.3%]. The predictive positive value and negative predictive value were respectively 95.2% [91.0%-97.8%] and 71.4% [66.1%-76.2%]. The seroconversion of specific IgM and IgG antibodies were observed as early as the 2 nd day after symptom onset. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> This test is quite useful for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection. Longitudinal studies on antibody responses during and post infection are needed.	false
0	Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in adults during the first and second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Houston, TX: the potential of the super-spreader. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a minority of index cases are associated with a majority of secondary cases suggesting that super-spreaders could drive the pandemic. We identified a phenotype in individuals with extremely high viral load who could act as super-spreaders., METHODS: Data were analyzed from individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 18 through August 15, 2020. Outcomes were compared using contingency table and quantile regression to test the equality of medians between the pandemic waves and by viral load groups., RESULTS: Of the 11,564 samples tested, 1,319 (11.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. An increase in weekly median viral load occurred in the second wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This population was more likely to be women, outpatients, symptomatic and have an extremely high or high viral load. In patients with multiple RT-PCR positive tests, the duration of viral shedding was comparable between individuals with asymptomatic/mild and mild/moderate illness severity., CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small group of individuals with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 viral load with mild illness. We believe that these individuals' characteristics could be consistent with the super-spreader phenomenon and that greater awareness of the social dynamics of these individuals is needed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

0	[Consequences of the corona pandemic on social networks in families at risk]. Background: The measures taken to reduce the incidence of infections during the corona pandemic brought about considerable restrictions, especially for families with school-age children. Particularly affected are families at risk, who were already confronted with mental disorders, poverty and cramped housing before the pandemic., Research question: How does the lockdown affect the composition and dynamics of the social networks of risk families?, Material and method: Mixed methods analysis based on 19 problem-centered interviews and 18 standardized egocentered networks with 224 persons (alter) named by the interviewees (ego)., Results: Networks are weakened by the crisis. At the same time, they are the most important resource for coping. Support is lacking, especially in the care of mentally ill children. The most important sources of support are the extended family and institutional facilities. The latter proved to be particularly unreliable during the crisis. In the best case the remaining relationships are strong enough to survive the situation. In the worst case the children are not only discharged from institutional structures (day care, school, medical and therapeutic assistance) but disappear completely from institutional and social custody. Their well-being then depends solely on the competence of their parents., Conclusion: In times of contact restrictions, families at risk need special attention. It is not enough to wait for them to ask for help or emergency care for their children. Institutions should proactively offer practical and informal support. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.	false
0	State fragility and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: an ecologic analysis of data from 146 countries. Background: : Global spread and impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are determined to a large extent, by resistance to the pandemic and public response of all countries in the world; while a country's resistance and response are in turn determined by its political and socio economic conditions. To inform future disease prevention and control, we analyzed global data to exam the relationship between state vulnerabilities and COVID-19 incidences and deaths., Methods: : Vulnerability was measured using the Fragile States Index (FSI). FSI is created by the Fund for Peace to assess levels of fragility for individual countries. Total FSI score and scores for 12 specific indicators were used as the predictor variables. Outcome variables were national cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths up to September 16, 2020, derived the World Health Organization. Cumulative incidence rates were computed using 2019 National population derived from the World Bank, and case fatality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths/COVID-19 cases. Countries with incomplete data were excluded, yielding a final sample of 146 countries. Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between the predictor and the outcome measures., Results: : There were dramatic cross-country variations in both FSI and COVID-19 epidemiological measurements. FSI total scores were negatively associated with both COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates (beta=-0.0135, P < 0.001) and case fatality rates (beta=-0.0147, P < 0.05). Of the 12 FSI indicators, three negatively associated with COVID-19 incidences were E1(Economic Decline and Poverty), E3 (Human Flight and Brain Drain), and S2 (Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons); two positively associated were P1 (State Legitimacy) and X1 (External Intervention). With regard to association with case fatality rates, C1 (Security Apparatus) was positive, and P3 (Human Rights and Rule of Law) and X1 was negative., Conclusions: : With FSI measures by the Fund of Peace, overall, more fragile countries are less likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and even if affected, death rates were lower. However, poor in state legitimacy and lack of external intervention are risk for COVID-19 infection and lack of security apparatus is risky for COVID-19 death. Implications of the study findings are discussed and additional studies are needed to examine the mechanisms underpinning these relationships. Copyright © 2021 People's Medical Publishing House Co.

0	"Quarantines as a Targeted Immunization Strategy. In the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, quarantine has been used to ""flatten the curve"" and slow the spread of the disease. In this paper, we show that this is not the only benefit of quarantine for the mitigation of an SIR epidemic spreading on a graph. Indeed, human contact networks exhibit a powerlaw structure, which means immunizing nodes at random is extremely ineffective at slowing the epidemic, while immunizing high-degree nodes can efficiently guarantee herd immunity. We theoretically prove that if quarantines are declared at the right moment, high-degree nodes are disproportionately in the Removed state, which is a form of targeted immunization. Even if quarantines are declared too early, subsequent waves of infection spread slower than the first waves. This leads us to propose an opening and closing strategy aiming at immunizing the graph while infecting the minimum number of individuals, guaranteeing the population is now robust to future infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only strategy that guarantees herd immunity without requiring vaccines. We extensively verify our results on simulated and real-life networks."	false
0	Iota-carrageenan neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and inhibits viral replication in vitro. In the absence of a vaccine and other effective prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a significant public health threat. Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mainly mediated by the spike glycoprotein. Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus in a dose dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 mug/ml iota-carrageenan. Experiments with patient isolated wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus showed an inhibition of replication in a similar range. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and endemic Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction of severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus and replication competent SARS-CoV-2 suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.	false
0	Subacute Thyroiditis in COVID-19 Patients. Introduction: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. The classic presentation of COVID-19 infection was described as fever, myalgia, cough, and fatigue. Whether coronavirus can directly attack the endocrine glands is unclear. Objective(s): Post-viral subacute thyroiditis (SAT, de Quervain thyroiditis) has been reported following other viral infection. A limited number of SAT after COVID-19 infection have been reported up to now. Method(s): Here, we reported 6 patients with SAT and positive COVID-19 serology tests. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and imaging data were presented. Result(s): In this study, 6 patients (4 women and 2 men) with clinician manifestations and physical examination in favor of SAT were described. Cervical ultrasonography showed bilateral hypoechoic areas in the thyroid gland which was suggestive of SAT. Elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine, and undetectable thyrotropin were found in laboratory evaluations. Both IgM and IgG were positive for COVID-19 infection, but the PCR tests were negative in all patients. Patients had history of working in a COVID center and/or family member hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were followed up for 1 month and were treated effectively with steroids. Conclusion(s): This report may help physicians to identify lesser-known manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection results in the prevention of further transmission.© 2020 European Thyroid Association Published by S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.	false
0	Identification of risk factors contributing to COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh: A GIS-based spatial modeling approach. Background: COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is an unprecedented shock throughout the world, which has generated a massive social, human, and economic crisis. Identification of risk factors is crucial to prevent the COVID-19 spread by taking appropriate countermeasures effectively. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the potential risk factors contributing to the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh., Method: Spatial regression methods were applied in this study to fulfill the aim. Data related to 28 demographic, economic, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected from secondary sources and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) regression models were developed in this study., Results: The results of the models identified four factors: percentage of the urban population, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital city, as significant risk factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh, with an R 2 value of 78.6%., Conclusion: Findings and discussions from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation, which helped discuss policy implications to negotiate the future epidemic crisis. The primary policy response would be to decentralize the urban population and economic activities from and around the capital city, Dhaka, to create self-sufficient regions throughout the country, especially in the north-western region.

0	Airborne Virus Transmission. Based on human behavior, immune system functions, and statistical analysis, this paper presents a novel hypothesis for a model for airborne virus transmission. The envisioned model aims to explain the statistical behavior of COVID-19, but also fits to other respiratory viruses. Since it is not possible to do direct experiments with human population and viruses, statistical evidence is used. The 2020 pandemic offered the opportunity to gather plenty of data in an infinity of test conditions that allow to eliminate variables and takes to useful and unexpected conclusions. Unprecedent social experiments, such as lockdown and face masks, never used massively before are some of those conditions. It was found strong correlations between the evolution of 2020 epidemic and other years outbreaks in the countries with the bigger number of cases in the world, performing 45% of COVID-19 in the world in the time of the study. It was also found a strong correlation, in those countries, with human behavior driven by climate conditions and the spread of COVID-19. It is proposed that the value of Rt is an indicator of the predominant contamination mechanism: direct contact or airborne. Finally, it is presented that the proposed transmission model is fully compatible with SIR model, and it is expected that future works could obtain more precise forecasts of viruses&rsquo; outbreaks.	false
0	Obtaining EHR-derived datasets for COVID-19 research within a short time: a flexible methodology based on Detailed Clinical Models. Background: COVID-19 ranks as the single largest health incident worldwide in decades. In such a scenario, electronic health records (EHRs) should provide a timely response to healthcare needs and to data uses that go beyond direct medical care and are known as secondary uses, which include biomedical research. However, it is usual for each data analysis initiative to define its own information model in line with its requirements. These specifications share clinical concepts, but differ in format and recording criteria, something that creates data entry redundancy in multiple electronic data capture systems (EDCs) with the consequent investment of effort and time by the organization. Objective(s): This study sought to design and implement a flexible methodology based on detailed clinical models (DCM), which would enable EHRs generated in a tertiary hospital to be effectively reused without loss of meaning and within a short time. Material(s) and Method(s): The proposed methodology comprises four stages: (1) specification of an initial set of relevant variables for COVID-19; (2) modeling and formalization of clinical concepts using ISO 13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies; (3) definition of transformation rules to generate secondary use models from standardized EHRs and development of them using R language; and (4) implementation and validation of the methodology through the generation of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC-WHO) COVID-19 case report form. This process has been implemented into a 1300-bed tertiary Hospital for a cohort of 4489 patients hospitalized from 25 February 2020 to 10 September 2020. Result(s): An initial and expandable set of relevant concepts for COVID-19 was identified, modeled and formalized using ISO-13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies. Similarly, an algorithm was designed and implemented with R and then applied to process EHRs in accordance with standardized concepts, transforming them into secondary use models. Lastly, these resources were applied to obtain a data extract conforming to the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form, without requiring manual data collection. The methodology allowed obtaining the observation domain of this model with a coverage of over 85% of patients in the majority of concepts. Conclusion(s): This study has furnished a solution to the difficulty of rapidly and efficiently obtaining EHR-derived data for secondary use in COVID-19, capable of adapting to changes in data specifications and applicable to other organizations and other health conditions. The conclusion to be drawn from this initial validation is that this DCM-based methodology allows the effective reuse of EHRs generated in a tertiary Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic, with no additional effort or time for the organization and with a greater data scope than that yielded by conventional manual data collection process in ad-hoc EDCs.Copyright © 2021 The Authors	false
0	Hemotherapy in times of COVID-19. The spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide has become one of the greatest health problems of our time. The impact of COVID-19 on health systems involves processes related to hemotherapy. The possibility of a person being accepted as a donor during the asymptomatic period of the disease constitutes a challenge for blood safety. Although there is no evidence to date of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by transfusions, different measures have been taken by health organizations and regulatory agencies to reduce the risk. Blood consumption does not decrease in disaster situations, however, during epidemics the number of donors may decrease. An efficient, care-based management of hemotherapy has been called to improve the therapeutic use of blood. During the epidemic, plasma therapy of convalescent patients emerges as a form of passive immunization. The safety measures taken in Cuba, the availability of blood components during the pandemic and the use of convalescent plasma are discussed.Copyright © 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

0	Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for SARS-CoV-2 on norovirus outbreaks: an analysis of outbreaks reported by 9 US States. In April 2020, the incidence of norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) dramatically declined. We used regression models to determine if this decline was best explained by underreporting, seasonal trends, or reduced exposure due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented for SARS-CoV-2 using data from 9 states from July 2012-July 2020. The decline in norovirus outbreaks was significant for all 9 states and underreporting or seasonality are unlikely to be the primary explanations for these findings. These patterns were similar across a variety of settings. NPIs appear to have reduced incidence of norovirus, a non-respiratory pathogen. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

0	Blood cancer health disparities in the United States Hispanic population. Cancer is a challenging, multifaceted disease that involves a combination of biological and non-biological factors. Aside from COVID-19, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.), and the first among Hispanic Americans. The Hispanic population is the largest minority group in the U.S., which is rapidly growing in size. Unfortunately, U.S. Hispanics and other minority groups experience many different health disparities, resulting in poor survival outcomes and a reduced quality of life. Factors such as genomic mutations, lower socioeconomic status, lack of education, reduced access to health care, comorbidities, and environmental factors all contribute to these health care inequalities. In the context of blood cancer health disparities, Hispanic patients are often diagnosed at a younger age and have worse outcomes compared with non-Hispanic individuals. In the present article, we highlight the existing knowledge about cancer health disparities in the Hispanic population, with a focus on chronic and acute leukemia. In our experience at the U.S./Mexico border, analysis of several different blood cancers demonstrated that younger Hispanic patients with acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia have higher incidence rates and worse prognoses. A combined approach, involving improved health care access and better knowledge of the underlying factors, will allow for more timely diagnoses and the development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating the disparities.

0	Evidence of protein coronas around soft nanoparticles regardless of the chemical nature of the outer surface: structural features and biological consequences. The formation of biomolecular coronas around nanoparticles as soon as they come in contact with biological media is nowadays well accepted. The self-developed biological outer surfaces can affect the targeting capability of the colloidal carriers as well as their cytotoxicity and cellular uptake behavior. In this framework, we explored the structural features and biological consequences of protein coronas around block copolymer assemblies consisting of a common pH-responsive core made by poly[2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDPA) and hydrophilic shells of different chemical natures: zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) or highly hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (PHPMA). We demonstrated the presence of ~50 nm protein coronas around the nanoparticles regardless of the chemical nature of the polymeric shells. The thickness is understood as the sum of the soft and hard layers and it is the actual interface seen by the cells. Although the soft corona composition is difficult to determine because the proteins are loosely bound to the outer surface of the assemblies, the tightly bound proteins (hard corona) could be identified and quantified. The compositional analysis of the hard corona demonstrated that human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fibrinogen are the main components of the protein coronas, and serotransferrin is present particularly in the protein corona of the zwitterionic-stabilized assemblies. The protein coronas substantially reduce the cellular uptake of the colloidal particles due to their increased size and the presence of HSA which is known to reduce nanoparticle-cell adhesion. On the other hand, their existence also reduces the levels of cytotoxicity of the polymeric assemblies, highlighting that protein coronas should not be always understood as artifacts that need to be eliminated due to their positive outputs.	false
0	The effect of the Safer at Home order on the frequency of DUI breath alcohol tests in Los Angeles County. With Los Angeles County having a population size of just over 10 million and an additional 471,000 people who commute into Los Angeles County for employment, many drivers are at risk of being injured or killed in an alcohol-impaired driving collision. On March 19, 2020, the County of Los Angeles issued the Safer at Home order as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This curtailed driving and decreased the number of breath alcohol tests that were conducted in Los Angeles County. The number of breath tests conducted in January-February of 2019 and 2020 and March-April of 2019 and 2020 were evaluated using Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overall number of breath tests conducted in Los Angeles County in March-April of 2020. There was also a significant decrease in the number of collisions where DUI was a factor. Accounting for changes in traffic volumes, the number of breath tests per vehicle miles driven also decreased significantly. Since the Safer at Home order closed all non-essential services such as bars and restaurants, there is indirect data on the relative contribution of liquor-serving establishments, and to some extent large social gatherings, to the incidence of drunk driving. Taking into account traffic volume, it was determined that the odds of encountering an intoxicated driver decreased by approximately 23% during the Safer at Home period. This information could help policy-makers determine the likely effectiveness of various countermeasures to prevent drunk driving. Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 viremia is associated with inflammatory, but not cardiovascular biomarkers, in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Background COVID-19 may present with a variety of cardiovascular manifestations, and elevations of biomarkers reflecting myocardial injury and stress are prevalent. SARS-CoV-2 has been found in cardiac tissue, and myocardial dysfunction post-COVID-19 may occur. However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and cardiovascular biomarkers remains unknown. Methods and Results COVID MECH was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60+/-15 years, 71 (58%) male, 68 (55%) Caucasian and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently male, had more diabetes mellitus and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and ferritin (all <0.001), but comparable levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; p=0.09), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; p=0.27) and D-dimer (p=0.67) to patients without viremia. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in plasma at either baseline or day 3 in 50 (52%) patients, and these patients experienced increase from baseline to day 3 in NT-proBNP and D-dimer concentrations, while there was no change in cTnT. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 viremia was associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory, but not cardiovascular biomarkers. NT-proBNP and D-dimer, but not cTnT, increased from baseline to day 3 in patients with viremia.	false
0	Functional Exhaustion of Type I and II Interferons Production in Severe COVID-19 Patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and has since spread across the world. Even though the majority of patients remain completely asymptomatic, some develop severe systemic complications. In this prospective study we compared the immunological profile of 101 COVID-19 patients with either mild, moderate or severe form of the disease according to the WHO classification, as well as of 50 healthy subjects, in order to identify functional immune factors independently associated with severe forms of COVID-19. Plasma cytokine levels, and cytokine levels upon in vitro non-specific stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells, were measured at several time points during the course of the disease. As described previously, inflammatory cytokines IL1beta, IL6, IL8, and TNFalpha associated with cytokine storm were significantly increased in the plasma of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (p < 0.0001 for all cytokines). During follow-up, plasma IL6 levels decreased between the moment of admission to the hospital and at the last observation carried forward for patients with favorable outcome (p = 0.02148). After in vitro stimulation of immune cells from COVID-19 patients, reduced levels of both type I and type II interferons (IFNs) upon in vitro stimulation were correlated with increased disease severity [type I IFN (IFNalpha): p > 0.0001 mild vs. moderate and severe; type II IFN (IFNgamma): p = 0.0002 mild vs. moderate and p < 0.0001 mild vs. severe] suggesting a functional exhaustion of IFNs production. Stimulated IFNalpha levels lower than 2.1 pg/ml and IFNgamma levels lower than 15 IU/mL at admission to the hospital were associated with more complications during hospitalization (p = 0.0098 and p =0.0002, respectively). A low IFNgamma level was also confirmed by multivariable analysis [p = 0.0349 OR = 0.98 (0.962; 0.999)] as an independent factor of complications. In vitro treatment with type IFNalpha restored type IFNgamma secretion in COVID-19 patients while the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL1beta remained stable or decreased, respectively. These results (a) demonstrate a functional exhaustion of both innate and adaptive immune response in severe forms of COVID-19; (b) identify IFNalpha and IFNgamma as new potential biomarkers of severity; and (c) highlight the importance of targeting IFNs when considering COVID-19 treatment in order to re-establish a normal balance between inflammatory and Th1 effector cytokines.

0	[The medical social technology of health preservation of elderly population in conditions of self-isolation]. In Moscow (as of January 1, 2020), the number of population made up to 12,678,079, and out of them the elderly population made up to 2.8 million. Up to the end of 2020, the number of the elderly will reach 3.3 million requiring implementation of corresponding preventive measures due to mass prevalence of coronavirus infection. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that despite restructuring of functioning of industry, social security and health care, quarantine and self-isolation occurred to be exactly the effective measures. The self-isolation regimen also revealed aggravation of harmful effects of stress factors, hypodynamia, hypooxygenation and decreasing of immunological resistance. It is especially important to organize leisure activities and to create the most comfortable conditions for isolated living of the elderly as most susceptible to infection. The experience demonstrated that properly chosen set of activities during self-isolation regimen both disciplines and permits to apply surplus of free time to intensify health potential and to consolidate family relationships.	false
0	Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from cross-sectional viral load distributions. Estimating an epidemic's trajectory is crucial for developing public health responses to infectious diseases, but incidence data used for such estimation are confounded by variable testing practices. We show instead that the population distribution of viral loads observed under random or symptom-based surveillance, in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values, changes during an epidemic and that Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory. Combining multiple such samples and the fraction positive improves the precision and robustness of such estimation. We apply our methods to Ct values from surveillance conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a variety of settings and demonstrate new approaches for real-time estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response.	false
0	Available COVID-19 serial seroconversion panel for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Seroconversion panels are an important tool for investigating antibody responses and developing serological assays. A seroconversion panel was generated from a single SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma donor over 87 days. This seroconversion panel was tested against 6 SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests (IgG, IgM, and total Ig). All test kits utilized recombinant antigens that are specific to SARS-CoV-2. The seroconversion panel showed IgG responses for SARS-CoV-2 after day 50. IgM levels peaked on day 50 (prior to IgG) and declined in subsequent samples. This seroconversion panel is a useful tool for validation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Copyright © 2021.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonosis like most of the great plagues sculpting human history, from smallpox to pandemic influenza and human immunodeficiency virus. When viruses jump into a new species the outcome of infection ranges from asymptomatic to lethal, historically ascribed to ""genetic resistance to viral disease."" People have exploited these differences for good and bad, for developing vaccines from cowpox and horsepox virus, controlling rabbit plagues with myxoma virus and introducing smallpox during colonization of America and Australia. Differences in resistance to viral disease are at the core of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis, yet our understanding of the mechanisms in any interspecies leap falls short of the mark. Here I review how the two key parameters of viral disease are countered by fundamentally different genetic mechanisms for resistance: (1) virus transmission, countered primarily by activation of innate and adaptive immune responses; and (2) pathology, countered primarily by tolerance checkpoints to limit innate and adaptive immune responses. I discuss tolerance thresholds and the role of CD8 T cells to limit pathological immune responses, the problems posed by tolerant superspreaders and the signature coronavirus evasion strategy of eliciting only short-lived neutralizing antibody responses. Pinpointing and targeting the mechanisms responsible for varying pathology and short-lived antibody were beyond reach in previous zoonoses, but this time we are armed with genomic technologies and more knowledge of immune checkpoint genes. These known unknowns must now be tackled to solve the current COVID-19 crisis and the inevitable zoonoses to follow.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	SARS-CoV-2 full length spike protein for COVID-19 vaccine development and diagnostic testing. Rationale: As of August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported >5.6 million cases and >175,000 deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. Our goal was to produce high quality SARS-CoV-2 proteins for vaccine development and diagnostic testing. Method(s): Recombinant full-length spike protein was genetically engineered to have enhanced stability, expressed in CHO cells, and purified by affinity chromatography. Expression was validated by western blot. An ELISA was performed to evaluate binding of a commercially available anti-spike antibody to the recombinant spike protein. Purity was assessed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and by relative peptide abundance using LC-MS/MS. COVID-19 positive patients' sera were tested for IgG reactivity to the spike protein. Mice were immunized with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Result(s): The recombinant spike protein was found to be >95% pure by LC-MS/MS (peptide signal abundance) and silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Expression of the full-length spike was confirmed by western blot which showed a single band at ~140 kD, which was recognized by an anti-spike antibody. Ten COVID-19 positive patients' sera, but not negative controls, had high IgG reactivity to the spike protein (titers >1/10,000). Mice immunized with the spike S1 subunit had IgG reactivity to the full spike. Conclusion(s): High quality SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was produced and used to develop an IgG antibody immunoassay. The purified spike protein did not react with COVID-19 negative patient sera and had high reactivity to COVID-19 positive patients. The pure and immunoreactive spike protein has applications in antibody testing and vaccine development.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Incidence of medically attended acute respiratory illnesses due to respiratory viruses across the life course during the 2018/19 influenza season. BACKGROUND: While multiple respiratory viruses circulate in humans, few studies have compared the incidence of different viruses across the life course. We estimated the incidence of outpatient illness due to 12 different viruses during November 2018 through April 2019 in a fully enumerated population., METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for ambulatory care visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA). Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group., RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000). RSV was the most common cause of medically attended ARI among children aged 1-4 years; coronaviruses were the most common among adults aged >=65 years., CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other studies focused on single viruses, we found that influenza and RSV were major causes of acute respiratory illness in persons of all ages. In comparison, coronaviruses and rhinovirus were also important pathogens. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses were the second-most common cause of medically attended ARI during the 2018/19 influenza season. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

0	Age-Related Changes in Clinical Presentation of Covid-19: the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey. BACKGROUND: The influence of aging and multimorbidity on Covid-19 clinical presentation is still unclear., OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the association between symptoms (or cluster of symptoms) and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was different according to patients' age and presence of multimorbidity., METHODS: The study included 6680 participants in the EPICOVID19 web-based survey, who reported information about symptoms from February to June 2020 and who underwent at least one NPS. Symptom clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis. The associations between symptoms (and clusters of symptoms) and positive NPS were investigated through multivariable binary logistic regression in the sample stratified by age (<65 vs >=65 years) and number of chronic diseases (0 vs 1 vs >=2)., RESULTS: The direct association between taste/smell disorders and positive NPS was weaker in older and multimorbid patients than in their younger and healthier counterparts. Having reported no symptoms reduced the chance of positive NPS by 86% in younger (95%CI: 0.11-0.18), and by 46% in older participants (95%CI: 0.37-0.79). Of the four symptom clusters identified (asymptomatic, generic, flu-like, and combined generic and flu-like symptoms), those associated with a higher probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection were the flu-like for older people, and the combined generic and flu-like for the younger ones., CONCLUSIONS: Older age and pre-existing chronic diseases may influence the clinical presentation of Covid-19. Symptoms at disease onset tend to aggregate differently by age. New diagnostic algorithms considering age and chronic conditions may ease Covid-19 diagnosis and optimize health resources allocation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04471701 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

0	ICAM-1 levels in patients with covid-19 with diabetic foot ulcers: A prospective study in southeast asia. Background: Viral infection can compound the severity of pre-existing inflammation caused by underlying diseases. For those with a chronic, immune-related condition such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) serves to exacerbate the inflammatory burden. Serum levels of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a primary mediator of cell adhesion express in the inflammatory process, are often used to indicate the gravity of all inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate serum ICAM-1 levels before and after debridement in patients with DFUs who were also diagnosed as COVID-19 positive compared with those who were COVID-19 negative., Methods: 20 patients with DFUs were screened for COVID-19 and then divided into COVID-19 positive and negative groups according to the results. Before debridement, chest x-rays and blood analysis, including ICAM-1 serum levels, were performed in both groups. Only ICAM-1 serum levels were measured after debridement., Results: Of the 20 patients included in this study, 55% were male (n = 11) and 45% were female (n = 9). The mean age was 52.9 +/- 1.9 years. ICAM-1 levels in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group (median 317.2 vs 149.2, respectively; p < 0.001). Serum levels of ICAM-1 reduced significantly in patients with DFU in the COVID-19-positive group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19-negative group after debridement (median 312.5 vs 130.3; p < 0.001)., Conclusion: ICAM-1 serum levels represent an additional, initial screening marker for COVID-19.

0	The Problem of Veteran Homelessness: An Update for the New Decade. INTRODUCTION: There has been a decade-long federal commitment to prevent and end homelessness among U.S. military veterans. Substantial progress has been made; so, a question that stakeholders ask is: Is veteran homelessness still a problem?, METHODS: To answer this question, 2 different data sources were analyzed in 2020: (1) a nationally representative community survey of 4,069 veterans conducted in 2019 and (2) national administrative data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on >6 million healthcare and homeless services in 2019., RESULTS: In the community sample, the lifetime prevalence of adult homelessness was 10.2%, with the highest prevalence found in participants aged 30-44 years (19.9% prevalence). In the Veterans Affairs administrative data, 4.2% of all Veterans Affairs service users used homeless services (n=290,515 Veterans Affairs homeless services); 27.9% of these were first-time Veterans Affairs homeless service users. Veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report any lifetime adult homelessness, more likely to be identified as homeless in Veterans Affairs records, and more likely to have used any Veterans Affairs homeless program. There was no sex difference in the lifetime prevalence of homelessness, but Veterans Affairs records showed that male veterans were more likely to be identified as homeless and to use homeless programs, suggesting possible underidentification of female veteran homelessness. Across age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, 35.1% of Veterans Affairs homeless service users used emergency department services in the same year., CONCLUSIONS: There is a continued need to dedicate resources to address veteran homelessness across sociodemographic groups, and these data serve as a benchmark before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Revealed the mystery of HBV related mixed cryoglobulinemia: potential biomarkers of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: The biomarkers of an immunological dysregulation due to a chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are indeed understudied. If untreated, this condition may evolve into liver impairment also co-occurred by extrahepatic involvements. Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC., RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC., CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers. Our results open new perspective in precision medicine era; in these challenging times, they could be also employed to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19 patients, at high risk of HBV reactivation due to liver impairment and/or immunosuppressive therapies.

0	Estimating the effect of selective border relaxation on COVID-19 in New Zealand. AIMS: We developed a model, updated daily, to estimate undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine following selectively opening New Zealand's borders to travellers from low-risk countries., METHODS: The prevalence of infectious COVID-19 cases by country was multiplied by expected monthly passenger volumes to predict the rate of arrivals. The rate of undetected infections entering the border following screening and quarantine was estimated. Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries were defined as those with an active COVID-19 prevalence of up to 1/105, 10/105 and 100/105, respectively., RESULTS: With 65,272 travellers per month, the number of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is 1 every 45, 15 and 31 months for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 countries, respectively. The overall rate of undetected active COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine is expected to increase from the current 0.40 to 0.50 per month, or an increase of one extra infection every 10 months., CONCLUSIONS: Loosening border restrictions results in a small increase in the rate of undetected COVID-19 infections exiting quarantine, which increases from the current baseline by one infection every 10 months. This information may be useful in guiding decision-making on selectively opening of borders in the COVID-19 era.	false
0	Optimizing Benefits of Testing Key Workers for Infection with SARS-CoV-2: A Mathematical Modeling Analysis. Background: Internationally, key workers such as healthcare staff are advised to stay at home if they or household members experience coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like symptoms. This potentially isolates/quarantines many staff without SARS-CoV-2, while not preventing transmission from staff with asymptomatic infection. We explored the impact of testing staff on absence durations from work and transmission risks to others. Method(s): We used a decision-analytic model for 1000 key workers to compare the baseline strategy of (S0) no RT-PCR testing of workers to testing workers (S1) with COVID-19-like symptoms in isolation, (S2) without COVID-19-like symptoms but in household quarantine, and (S3) all staff. We explored confirmatory re-testing scenarios of repeating all initial tests, initially positive tests, initially negative tests, or no re-testing. We varied all parameters, including the infection rate (0.1-20%), proportion asymptomatic (10-80%), sensitivity (60-95%), and specificity (90-100%). Result(s): Testing all staff (S3) changes the risk of workplace transmission by-56.9 to +1.0 workers/1000 tests (with reductions throughout at RT-PCR sensitivity >=65%), and absences by-0.5 to +3.6 days/test but at heightened testing needs of 989.6-1995.9 tests/1000 workers. Testing workers in household quarantine (S2) reduces absences the most by 3.0-6.9 days/test (at 47.0-210.4 tests/1000 workers), while increasing risk of workplace transmission by 0.02-49.5 infected workers/1000 tests (which can be minimized when re-testing initially negative tests). Conclusion(s): Based on optimizing absence durations or transmission risk, our modeling suggests testing staff in household quarantine or all staff, depending on infection levels and testing capacities.

0	Saliva sample as a non-invasive specimen for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019: a cross-sectional study. Objectives: Amid the increasing number of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method(s): From 27 March to 4 April 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Result(s): Two-hundred pairs of samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%-96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%-99.9%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (kappa coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Saliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false
0	COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Nigeria: Gender based analysis. Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been surging globally. Risk strata in medical attention are of dynamic significance for apposite assessment and supply distribution. Presently, no known cultured contrivance is available to fill this gap of this pandemic. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model based on vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model of various orders for gender based daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria. This study also aims to proffer empirical evidence that compares incidence between male and female for COVID-19 risk factors. Method(s): Wilcoxon signed-rank test is employed to investigate the significance of the difference in the gender distributions of the daily incidence. A VARMA model of various orders is formulated for the gender based daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria. The optimal VARMA model is identified using Bayesian information criterion. Also, a predictive model based on univariate autoregressive moving average model is formulated for the daily death cases in Nigeria. Fold change is estimated based on crude case-fatality risk to investigate whether there is massive underreporting and under-testing of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Result(s): Daily incidence is higher in males on most days from 11 April 2020 to 12 September 2020. Result of Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that incidence among male is significantly higher than female (p-value < 2.22 x 10-16). White neural network test shows that daily female incidence is not linear in mean (p-value = 0.00058746) while daily male incidence is linear in mean (p-value = 0.4257). McLeod-Li test shows that there is autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in the female incidence (Maximum p-value = 1.4277 x 10-5) and male incidence (Maximum p-value = 9.0816 x 10-14) at 5% level of significance. Ljung-Box test (Tsay, 2014) shows that the daily incidence cases are not random (p-value=0.0000). The optimal VARMA model for male and female daily incidence is VARMA (0,1). The optimal model for the Nigeria's daily COVID-19 death cases is identified to be ARIMA (0,1,1). There is no evidence of massive underreporting and under-testing of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Conclusion(s): Comparison of the observed incidence with fitted data by gender shows that the optimal VARMA and ARIMA models fit the data well. Findings highlight the significant roles of gender on daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria.Copyright © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.	false
0	Testing and tracking in the UK: A dynamic causal modelling study. By equipping a previously reported dynamic causal modelling of COVID-19 with an isolation state, we were able to model the effects of self-isolation consequent on testing and tracking. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic—and could only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections is highly unlikely. The emergence of a second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A testing and tracking policy—implemented at the present time—will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation—using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.	false
0	PROTECTIVE ROLE OF CORTISTATIN IN PULMONARY INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS. <h4>Background: </h4> and Purpose: Acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis remain major causes of morbidity, mortality and healthcare burden in the critically ill patient. There is an urgent medical need for identifying factors of susceptibility and prognosis and for designing new therapeutic tools for treating these disorders. Here, we evaluate the capacity of the immunomodulatory neuropeptide cortistatin to regulate pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in vivo. Experimental Approach: ALI/ARDS and pulmonary fibrosis were induced experimentally in wild-type and cortistatin-deficient mice by pulmonary infusion of the bacterial endotoxin LPS or the chemotherapeutic drug bleomycin, and the histopathological signs, pulmonary leukocyte infiltration and cytokines and fibrotic markers were evaluated. Key Results: Partially-deficient mice in cortistatin showed exacerbated pulmonary damage, pulmonary inflammation, alveolar oedema and fibrosis, and subsequent increased respiratory failure and mortality when challenged to LPS or bleomycin, even at low doses. Treatment with cortistatin reversed these aggravated phenotypes and protected from progression to severe ARDS and fibrosis after high-exposition to both injury agents. Moreover, cortistatin-deficient pulmonary macrophages and fibroblasts showed exaggerated ex vivo inflammatory and fibrotic responses. The anti-fibrotic protective effect of cortistatin was also observed in experimental scleroderma, in which lack of cortistatin predisposes to develop more severe dermal lesions and associated pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion and Implications: We identify to cortistatin as an endogenous break of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Deficiency in cortistatin could be a marker of poor-prognosis in inflammatory/fibrotic pulmonary disorders. Cortistatin-based therapies emerge as attractive candidates to treat severe ALI/ARDS, including SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS.	false
0	Persisting adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Lower Austria. The prevalence and persistence of adaptive immunity responses following a SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into potential population immunity. Adaptive immune responses comprise of antibody-based responses as well as T cell responses mainly addressing viruses and virus-infected human cells, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of both types of adaptive immunity is essential to follow population-based SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. In this study, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activities in patients who recovered from a COVID-19 infection in spring and autumn 2020. Here we observed a robust and stable SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune response in both groups with persisting IgA and IgG levels as well as stable T cell activity. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of a lasting immune response with the severity of disease. Our data give evidence for a persisting adaptive immune memory, which suggest a continuing immunity for more than six months post infection.	false

0	Ultrasensitive assay for saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is highly valuable for identifying asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals to slow community disease transmission. However, there remains a technological gap for highly reliable, easy, and quick SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests that are suitable for frequent mass testing. Compared to the conventional nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-based tests, saliva-based methods are attractive due to easier and safer sampling protocols. Despite its merits in rapid turn-around-time and high throughput compared to traditional PCR-based technologies, the widespread use of saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests is hindered by limited analytical sensitivity of current methods. Here, we report the first ultrasensitive, saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with an analytical sensitivity of < 0.32 pg/ml, corresponding to 4 viral RNA copies/ul, which is comparable to that of PCR-based tests. Using the novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based S-PLEX immunoassay, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen concentration in 105 saliva samples obtained from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Our assay displayed absolute specificity and high sensitivity (90.2%), where it correctly identified samples with viral loads up to 35 CT cycles by saliva-based PCR. Paired NP swab-based PCR results were also obtained for 86 cases for comparison. Our assay showed high concordance with saliva-based and NP swab-based PCR in samples with negative (< 0.32 pg/ml) and strongly positive (> 2 pg/ml) N antigen concentrations. Our study unveiled the ultrasensitivity and specificity of the saliva-based S-PLEX assay, demonstrating its clinical value as a high throughput, complementary alternative to PCR-based techniques. The novel technique is especially valuable in cases where compliance to frequent swabbing may be problematic (e.g. schools, nursing homes, etc.).	false
0	A chicken IgY can efficiently inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the ACE2 binding domain in vitro. COVID-19 pneumonia is spreading widely in the world now. Currently, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed. The vaccine is the most effective way to control the epidemic. Passive immune antibodies are also an effective method to prevent and cure COVID-19 pneumonia. We used SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as an antigen to immunize layers in order to extract, separate and purify SARS-CoV-2-IgY from egg yolk. SARS-CoV-2-IgY(S-IgY) can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the Cells and reduce the viral load in cells. The EC 50 of W3-IgY (S-IgY in the third week after immunization) is1.35 ± 0.15nM. The EC 50 of W9-IgY (S-IgYin the ninth week after immunization) is 2.76 ± 1.54 nM. When the dose of S-IgY is 55 nM, the fluorescence representing intracellular viral protein is obviously weakenedin Immunofluorescence microscopy. <h4>Results: </h4> of Sars-CoV-2 /VeroE6 cell experiment confirmed that S-IgY had strong antiviral effecton SARS-Co-V-2, and its EC 50 is 27.78 ± 1.54nM vs 3259 ± 159.62 nM of Redesivir (differ>106 times, P < 0.001 ). S-IgY can inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, which is related to its targeting the ACE2 binding domain. S-IgY is safe, efficient, stable and easy to obtain. This antibody may have the potential to be an effective method for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4> (see Fig.1.)	false
0	Comprehensive mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain that affect recognition by polyclonal human plasma antibodies. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD's receptor-binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some plasma is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in the emerging 20H/501Y.V2 and 20J/501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Going forward, these plasma escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	T cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2: Experience from a French transplantation and hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunosuppressed organ-transplanted patients are considered at risk for severe forms of COVID-19. Moreover, exaggerated innate and adaptive immune responses might be involved in severe progression of the disease. However, no data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in transplanted patients are currently available. Here, we report the first assessment of antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 11 kidney-transplanted patients recovered from RT-PCR-confirmed (n = 5) or initially suspected (n = 6) COVID-19. After reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 transplant patients were able to mount vigorous antiviral T cell and antibody responses, as efficiently as two nontherapeutically immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis. By contrast, six RT-PCR-negative patients displayed no antibody response. Among them, three showed very low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, whereas no T cell response was detected in the other three, potentially ruling out COVID-19 diagnosis. Low levels of T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 were also detected in seronegative healthy controls without known exposure to the virus. These results suggest that during COVID-19, monitoring both T cell and serological immunity might be helpful for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 but are also needed to evaluate a potential role of antiviral T cells in the development of severe forms of the disease.Copyright © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons	false

0	A Case Study Supporting Lack of SARS-CoV-2 Spread to a 3-Month Old Infant Through Exclusive Breastfeeding. INTRODUCTION: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 global pandemic, maternal and newborn wellbeing has received much attention. Detailed reports of infected women breastfeeding their infants are uncommon. Due to incomplete information available, full data about those infants' outcomes are lacking, and evidence of infectivity through breastfeeding has not been documented., MAIN ISSUE: Here, we report about a mother who breastfed her infant until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection. After follow-up, we have confirmed that the infant, who was breastfed by the infected mother, was not infected., METHODS: A 33-year-old woman gave birth to a full-term male infant on November 8, 2019. Since birth, she had been exclusively breastfeeding the baby until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection on February 8, 2020. She was hospitalized, isolated from her baby, and stopped breastfeeding. Even though she remained asymptomatic, her milk was expressed using a breast pump and discarded. The mother's milk sample was collected on February 9, 2020, and the result of the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative. Her infant was asymptomatic and remained virus negative. Her laboratory findings and chest Computed Tomography imaging was normal. She was treated according to the national protocol with aerosolized interferon alpha2beta, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Her serum SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies(IgG and IgM) tested positive when discharged. She returned to breastfeeding after discharge., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that breastfeeding may be less of a risk than anticipated. Additional research is needed to explore this possibility.	false
0	The Usefulness Of SARS-CoV-2 Test-Positive Proportion As A Surveillance Tool. Comparison of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virologic testing to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test-positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to inform trends in incidence. We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. Collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.

0	COVID-19 related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C): a case series from a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Qatar. <h4>Background: </h4> Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a severe complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which is increasingly being reported worldwide. Here we report the first case series of 7 children diagnosed with MIS-C in Qatar. <h4>Methods: </h4> Clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Sidra Medicine, Qatar from June to October 2020, who met the WHO case definition for MIS-C were reviewed. <h4>Results: </h4>: The mean age in our case series was 5.6 years, of which 71.4% were males. All patients were previously healthy but had a history of COVID-19 infection. Fever, rash, vomiting and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms (70%-100%). The average hospitalization was 12.9 days with no case fatalities. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in most patients, as well as evidence of coagulopathy and elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin. Many patients (71.4%) required inotropic support in intensive care, while only one required respiratory support. Although all patients had elevated cardiac biomarkers, cardiovascular involvement was observed in 42.9% of patients with one patient developing a giant coronary aneurysm. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and 86% of patients received corticosteroids, with two patients requiring treatment with IL-1 inhibitors. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> Our report is one of the first reports on MIS-C from Asia. Although clinical features and outcomes are not significantly different from those reported elsewhere, lack of case fatalities in our cohort may indicate that early recognition and prompt medical attention is necessary for a favorable outcome in MIS-C.	false
0	Prognostic bioindicators in severe COVID-19 patients. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. Here we evaluated a panel of biomarkers to phenotype patients and to define the role of immuno-inflammatory mediators as biomarkers of severity. Material(s) and Method(s): Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients on admission to hospital, before any treatment or infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C-peptide were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. IL-6 assay was validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate patients was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression was performed to combine parameters of the two groups. Result(s): In the severe group, IL-6, CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate patients. KL-6, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were directly correlated with each other. ROC curve analysis of the logistic regression model including IL-6, KL-6 and CRP showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.95. Conclusion(s): Besides corroborating previous reports of over-expression of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations were correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP. The combination of these three prognostic bioindicators made it possible to distinguish severe COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis from mild-to-moderate patients.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Guidance for the procurement of COVID-19 convalescent plasma: differences between high- and low-middle-income countries. Background and objectives: COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been used, predominantly in high-income countries (HICs) to treat COVID-19; available data suggest the safety and efficacy of use. We sought to develop guidance for procurement and use of CCP, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for which data are lacking. Material(s) and Method(s): A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and haematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self-identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product-related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices. Result(s): The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre-donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption. Conclusion(s): There has been wide-scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use. By contrast, LMICs, having received little attention, require locally applicable strategies for adoption of CCP.Copyright © 2020 International Society of Blood Transfusion	false

0	Epidemiological features of coronavirus disease 2019 in children: a meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: Many studies have been published recently on the characteristics of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children. The quality scores of literature are different, and the incidence of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests results vary greatly. Therefore, a systematic retrospective meta-analysis is needed to determine the incidence of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from databases, such as PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Johns Hopkins University, and Chinese databases were analysed from January 31, 2020 to October 20, 2020. High-quality articles were selected for analysis based on a quality standard score. A meta-analysis of random effects was used to determine the prevalence of comorbidities and subgroup meta-analysis to examine the changes in the estimated prevalence in different subgroups., RESULTS: Seventy-one articles involving 11,671 children were included in the study. The incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, asymptomatic patients, nervous system symptoms, and chest tightness was 55.8%, 56.8%, 14.4%, 21.1%, 6.7%, and 6.1%, respectively. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome was 6.2%. Laboratory examination results showed that lymphocytes decreased in 12% and leukocytes decreased in 8.8% of patients, whereas white blood cells increased in 7.8% of patients. Imaging showed abnormalities in 66.5%, and ground-glass opacities were observed in 36.9% patients. Epidemiological history was present in 85.2% cases; severe disease rate was 3.33%. The mortality rate was 0.28%., CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in children are mild, and laboratory indicators and imaging manifestations are atypical. While screening children for COVID-19, in addition to assessing patients for symptoms as the first step of screening, the epidemiological history of patients should be obtained.	false
0	Evaluation of four commercial, fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests suggests a revision of the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Objectives: Serological tests detect antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance., Methods: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients)., Results: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results., Conclusions: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the company's newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay for follow-up studies. A combination of tests could be considered in clinical practice.	false

0	Maturation and persistence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 memory B cell response. Memory B cells play a fundamental role in host defenses against viruses, but to date, their role has been relatively unsettled in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We report here a longitudinal single-cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool. Highlighting germinal center maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of somatic mutations in their variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide long-term protection.

0	The Utility of Specific Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 in Laboratory Diagnosis. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a global pandemic due to its high transmissibility. The unavoidable shortcomings of traditional diagnostic assay, including nucleic acid testing, diverse serological assays characterized by high-throughput and less workload, are playing a more and more crucial role to supplement the nucleic acid test. In this review, we summarize the dynamic change of the specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as neutralizing antibodies and discuss the clinical utility and limitations of the different serological assays. SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus, shows some unique pathogenetic and epidemiological characteristics that have not been completely understood so far. Currently, studies about the antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical utility of serological testing are increasing. It's well suggested that the combination of serological tests and nucleic acid tests can cohesively improve the testing efficiency for identifying COVID-19 suspected patients.	false
0	Performance of three SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, three rapid lateral flow tests and a novel bead-based affinity surrogate test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum. For the control of immunity in COVID-19 survivors and vaccinated subjects there is an urgent need for reliable and rapid serological assays. Based on samples from 63 COVID-19 survivors up to seven months after symptom onset, and on 50 serum samples taken before the beginning of the pandemic, we compared the performance of three commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun SARS-COV-2 IgA/IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, and SERION ELISA agile SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG) and three rapid lateral flow (immunochromatographic) tests (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM, NADAL COVID-19 IgG/IgM, and Cleartest Corona 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM) with a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) representing the gold standard. In addition, we report and validate a novel, non-commercial flow cytometry bead-based surrogate test. 57 out of 63 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (90 %) showed neutralizing antibodies. The sensitivity of the seven assays ranged from 7.0 % to 98.3 %, the specificity from 86.0 % to 100.00 %. Only one commercial immunoassay showed a sensitivity and specificity of greater than 98 %. These data indicate abundant interassay variability.	false
0	Emerging therapeutic approaches to COVID-19. Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive single-stranded RNA virus having a large genome ~30 kb. SARS-CoV-2 is zoonotic and highly contagious, causing severe pneumonia-like symptoms. The efficacy of the different potential drug and drug candidates against COVID-19 has been investigated which are under various stages of clinical trials. The drugs effective against SARS, and Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), have been proposed to have a high potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we selected plant-based materials implicated in the prevention and therapy of COVID-19. The vaccine has shown impressive results in producing antibodies against SARS-CoV2 and has been evaluated for safety, tolerance, and preliminary immunogenicity. Similarly, DNA/RNA-based therapy shown high clinical significance. The plant produces secondary metabolites in response to viral infection to protect them. Many nanomaterials produced by carbohydrates and lipids been exploited for their in-vitro and in-vivo delivery of antiviral therapeutics. Different classes of secondary metabolites have a different mechanism to counter virus attacks. While some natural medicines in the form of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other nutrients help to enhance immunity, such measures should not replace social distancing, quarantining special care to protect from COVID-19. The standards of reporting were in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.	false
0	Insights into neutralizing antibody responses in individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in Chile. Chile has one of the worst numbers worldwide in terms of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and COVID-19-related deaths per million inhabitants; thus, characterization of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in the general population is critical to understanding of immunity at the local level. Given our inability to perform massive classical neutralization assays due to the scarce availability of BSL-3 facilities in the country, we developed and fully characterized an HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, which was used in a 96-well plate format to investigate NAb responses in samples from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with convalescent plasma. We also identified samples with decreased or enhanced neutralization activity against the D614G spike variant compared with the wild type, indicating the relevance of this variant in host immunity. The data presented here represent the first insights into NAb responses in individuals from Chile, serving as a guide for future studies in the country.

0	Influence of age and gender on the epidemic of COVID-19: Evidence from 177 countries and territories-an exploratory, ecological study. Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide with an uncertain ultimate impact on every aspect of human society. Recognizing the groups with higher susceptibility and fatality are in urgent need. Method(s): We retrieved the total number of confirmed incident and death cases of COVID-19 in 177 countries/territories from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Data of age and gender composition were collected from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to explore the association between the composition of age and gender and the incidence rate (IRC), case fatality rate (CFRC), and mortality rate of COVID-19 (MRC). Multiple comparisons were adjusted by the Bonferroni method, and the threshold p-value was set as p<0.01. Software SPSS 23.0, ArcGIS 10.6, and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used to generate our results. Result(s): Median age was positively correlated to IRC, CFRC and MRC (rs= 0.60; rs= 0.27; rs= 0.61, p<0.0001 for all). The age-dependent correlation between people over 65 years of age with IRC was higher in females, while the correlation between age distribution and CFRC as well as MRC was higher in males (p<0.0001 for all). Besides, we found the age-gender-dependent differences were correlated to IRC in places with high income and associated with CFRC in non-high income countries/territories. Conclusion(s): The correlation between the composition of age and gender and the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 confirmed previous points that females are more susceptible to COVID-19. The results remind us that more attention should be paid to male patients, particularly those over 65 years old for enhanced clinical management.Copyright © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities for people with epilepsy. In this cohort study, we aim to compare outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with severe epilepsy and other co-morbidities living in long-term care facilities which all implemented early preventative measures, but different levels of surveillance. During 25-week observation period (16 March-6 September 2020), we included 404 residents (118 children), and 1643 caregivers. We compare strategies for infection prevention, control, and containment, and related outcomes, across four UK long-term care facilities. Strategies included early on-site enhancement of preventative and infection control measures, early identification and isolation of symptomatic cases, contact tracing, mass surveillance of asymptomatic cases and contacts. We measured infection rate among vulnerable people living in the facilities and their caregivers, with asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, including fatality rate. We report 38 individuals (17 residents) who tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive, with outbreaks amongst residents in two facilities. At Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy (CCE), 10/98 residents tested positive: two symptomatic (one died), eight asymptomatic on weekly enhanced surveillance; 2/275 caregivers tested positive: one symptomatic, one asymptomatic. At St Elizabeth's (STE), 7/146 residents tested positive: four symptomatic (one died), one positive during hospital admission for symptoms unrelated to COVID-19, two asymptomatic on one-off testing of all 146 residents; 106/601 symptomatic caregivers were tested, 13 positive. In addition, during two cycles of systematically testing all asymptomatic carers, four tested positive. At The Meath (TM), 8/80 residents were symptomatic but none tested; 26/250 caregivers were tested, two positive. At Young Epilepsy (YE), 8/80 children were tested, all negative; 22/517 caregivers were tested, one positive. Infection outbreaks in long-term care facilities for vulnerable people with epilepsy can be quickly contained, but only if asymptomatic individuals are identified through enhanced surveillance at resident and caregiver level. We observed a low rate of morbidity and mortality, which confirmed that preventative measures with isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 residents can reduce resident-to-resident and resident-to-caregiver transmission. Children and young adults appear to have lower infection rates. Even in people with epilepsy and multiple co-morbidities, we observed a high percentage of asymptomatic people suggesting that epilepsy-related factors (anti-seizure medications and seizures) do not necessarily lead to poor outcomes.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Development of Safe and Highly Protective Live-Attenuated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates by Genome Recoding. Safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed to stop the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We constructed a series of live attenuated vaccine candidates by large-scale recoding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and assessed their safety and efficacy in Syrian hamsters. Animals were vaccinated with a single dose of the respective recoded virus and challenged 21 days later. Two of the tested viruses did not cause clinical symptoms, but were highly immunogenic and induced strong protective immunity. Attenuated viruses replicated efficiently in the upper but not in the lower airways, causing only mild pulmonary histopathology. After challenge, hamsters developed no signs of disease and rapidly cleared challenge virus: at no time could infectious virus be recovered from the lungs of infected animals. The ease with which attenuated virus candidates can be produced and administered favors their further development as vaccines to combat the ongoing pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding: This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant OS143/16-1 and COVID-19 grants from Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin and Berlin University Alliance awarded to NO, the DFG grant SFB-TR84/Z01b awarded to ADG and JT and the SwissNational Science Foundation, grants 31CA30_196644, 31CA30_196062, and 310030_173085 awarded to VT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no competing interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethical Approval: In vitro and animal work was done under biosafety conditions in the BSL-3 facility at the Institut f&uuml;r Virologie, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Germany.

0	"892 Remote monitoring of pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19. Objective: Follow up for women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is warranted given potential for worsening disease. We sought to evaluate a remote monitoring system developed to manage pregnant or postpartum women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and to describe their disease course. Study Design: Pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in a remote symptom monitoring program. Postpartum women diagnosed through universal screening on delivery admission were also included. Women received automated twice-daily text messages to assess symptoms and were escalated to a Maternal Fetal Medicine provider for worsening dyspnea or a text of ""worse"" at any time (Figure 1). The managing provider evaluated the patient via telephone and triaged to continued outpatient surveillance or referral to the ED. Result(s): One hundred sixty women (113 Black, 36 White, 11 Other) were enrolled from March 23, 2020 to September 14, 2020. One hundred forty two were pregnant with a mean gestational age of 25w1d at enrollment. Eighteen women enrolled postpartum (14 asymptomatic). Of those enrolled, 93 tested positive, 47 negative, and 20 never underwent recommended testing. One hundred thirty women (81%) responded to at least one text each day, with 98 (61.3%) managed without escalation. Automated escalation occurred in 32(20%) women (75% Black), with 28 directed to continue self-monitoring at home and 4 directed to an ED. Of those directed to the ED, 2 (50%) women were admitted due to hypoxia. None of the asymptomatic postpartum women worsened after discharge. Women who did not respond (n=30) or did not escalate did not have any office or ED visits within the health system related to COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Automated text-messaging was effective in remotely monitoring pregnant and postpartum women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, thereby improving the efficiency and reducing resources needed for follow up. The majority of pregnant women were able to remain outpatient while appropriately identifying patients with worsening disease severity. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Response to Whole-Lung Low-Dose Radiation Therapy (LD-RT) Predicts Freedom from Intubation in Patients Receiving Dexamethasone and/or Remdesevir for COVID-19-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). <h4>Background: </h4> Phase I/II clinical trials have explored whole-lung low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Initial findings require reproduction. Concomitant LD-RT administration with existing therapies requires safety evaluation. <h4>Methods:</h4> Patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving dexamethasone and/or remdesevir were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or until hospital discharge, and compared to controls blindly matched by age, comorbidity, and disease severity. Eligible patients were hospitalized, SARS-CoV-2 positive, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen. Endpoints included safety, clinical recovery, intubation, radiographic changes, and biomarker response. Findings: 20 patients received whole-lung LD-RT between Jun 11 and Dec 7, 2020 and were compared to controls. Freedom from intubation improved from 68% in controls to 86% following LD-RT (p=0.09) as did C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.02) and creatine kinase (CK) (p<0.01) levels, consistent with prior report. Eighty percent of LD-RT patients experienced rapid decline in CRP within 3 days and were classified as LD-RT responders. Intubation-free survival (100% vs 66%, p=0.01) and oxygenation loads were lower in LD-RT responders compared to matched controls: 32% lower per individual (p=0.03) and 56% lower for the cohort (p=0.06). No patient whose CRP declined following LD-RT died or required intubation, whereas all LD-RT non-responders died. Observed reduction of prolonged recoveries and hospitalization times did not reach significance. Radiographic changes were equivalent. Interpretation: A cohort of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS treated with LD-RT demonstrated superior freedom from intubation compared to matched controls, especially LD-RT responders (p=0.01). LD-RT appears safe to deliver with concurrent drugs. LD-RT lowered CRP and CK biomarkers. CRP response predicted favorable outcome. Optimal timing for LD-RT after oxygen dependence but before intubation may extinguish immunopathology prior to systemic spread. Confirmatory clinical trials are warranted.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance in Mainz, Germany, reveals convergent origin of the N501Y spike mutation in a hospital setting. While establishing a regional SARS-Cov-2 variant surveillance by genome sequencing, we have identified three infected individuals in a clinical setting (two long-term hospitalized patients and a nurse) that shared the spike N501Y mutation within a genotype background distinct from the current viral variants of concern. We suggest that the adaptive N501Y mutation, known to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, arose by convergent evolution around December in Mainz, Germany. Hospitalized patients with a compromised immune system may be a potential source of novel viral variants, which calls for monitoring viral evolution by genome sequencing in clinical settings.	false
0	COVID 19 infection: Pediatric perspectives. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe, causing innumerable deaths and a massive economic catastrophe. Exposure to household members with confirmed COVID-19 is the most common source of infection among children. Children are just as likely as adults to get infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most children are asymptomatic and when symptoms occur, they are usually mild. Infants <12 months old are at a higher risk for severe or critical disease. COVID-19 is diagnosed the same way in pediatric population as adults by testing specimen obtained from upper respiratory tract for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using reverse transcriptase viral polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The common laboratory findings in hospitalized patient include leukopenia, lymphopenia, and increased levels of inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray findings are variable and computed tomography scans of the chest may show ground glass opacities similar to adults or non-specific findings. Prevention is the primary intervention strategy. Recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and many other vaccine candidates are in the investigational stage. There is limited data in children on the use of antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, monoclonal antibody, and convalescent plasma. Oxygen therapy is required in hypoxic children (saturation <92%). Similar to adults, other measures to maintain oxygenation such as high flow nasal cannula, CPAP, or ventilatory support may be needed. Ventilatory management strategies should include use of low tidal volumes (5-6 cc/kg), high positive expiratory pressure, adequate sedation, paralysis, and prone positioning. Recently, a new entity associated with COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has emerged. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria are the basis for this diagnosis. Management options include ICU admission, steroids, intravenous gamma globulin, aspirin, anakinra, and anticoagulants. Vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) is used to guide vasopressor support.

0	Consistency of recommendations and methodological quality of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 have been developed, but the quality of those guidelines and the consistency of recommendations are unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of the diagnosis and treatment guidelines on COVID-19 and analyze the consistency of the recommendations of these guidelines., METHODS: We searched for guidelines on diagnosis and/or treatment of COVID-19 through PubMed, CBM, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. In addition, we also searched official websites of the US CDC, European CDC and WHO, and some guideline collection databases. We included diagnosis and/or treatment guidelines for COVID-19, including rapid advice guidelines and interim guidelines. Two trained researchers independently extracted data and four trained researchers evaluated the quality of the guidelines using the AGREE II instruments. We extracted information on the basic characteristics of the guidelines, guideline development process, and the recommendations. We described the consistency of the direction of recommendations for treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 across the included guidelines., RESULTS: A total of 37 guidelines were included. Most included guidelines were assessed as low quality, with only one of the six domains of AGREE II (clarity of presentation) having a mean score above 50%. The mean scores of three domains (stakeholder involvement, the rigor of development and applicability) were all below 30%. The recommendations on diagnosis and treatment were to some extent consistent between the included guidelines. Computed tomography (CT), X-rays, lung ultrasound, RT-PCR, and routine blood tests were the most commonly recommended methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty guidelines were on the treatment of COVID-19. The recommended forms of treatment included supportive care, antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, antibiotics, immunoglobulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), convalescent plasma, and psychotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of currently available diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 is low. The diagnosis and treatment recommendations between the included guidelines are highly consistent. The main diagnostic methods for COVID-19 are RT-PCR and CT, with ultrasound as a potential diagnostic tool. As there is no effective treatment against COVID-19 yet, supportive therapy is at the moment the most important treatment option.

0	Perspectives of Region II OSHA Authorized Safety and Health Trainers About Initial COVID-19 Response Programs. In this cross-sectional survey-based study conducted in early fall 2020, we attempted to measure and ascertain the extent of whether employers in New York and New Jersey were prepared to manage and follow occupational safety and health (S&H) regulations and industry risk processes in developing an exposure control response program to COVID-19, the disease caused by exposure to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We focused on Region II of the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL)-Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In addition, we examined possible explanations for lack of compliance and uniformity across the region in various USDOL-OSHA regulatory aspects like training, respiratory protection program administration and proper task-specific application of occupational S&H hazard controls through risk management systems. We suggest opportunities for employer and governmental interventions to reduce potential worker exposures and better control future worksite biological hazards and infectious disease transmission. Overall, data suggested prevalent inconsistencies, noncompliance and a less than uniform approach to implementing COVID-19 response programs. Copyright © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Experience and management of two paediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with major burn injuries in an intensive care unit. SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly disseminating, leading to a world pandemics in which we are also affected. In San Borja Peruvian National Children Health Institute, which is the reference center for surgical pediatric patients, 106 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized. Of them, 11 presented with burns and two had large burns. The viral infection was diagnosed using molecular testing. We present in detail the case of a pediatric seven-year old patient who had large burns and was taken care of in the intensive care unit. She had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and her outcome was good, with a good prognosis, and she recovered completely and uneventfully. On the other hand, COVID-19 may present as a severe disease leading to a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome with some uncommon clinical manifestations which affect its prognosis, as it was the case with another seven-month old patient who passed away in spite of having received specialized and timely therapy.Copyright © 2020 Acta Medica Peruana.

0	A Social Recovery, Workplace Democracy and Security: COVID-19 and Labour Law. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the painful consequences of poor job security and workplace democracy. The UK government&rsquo;s initial flirt with &lsquo;herd immunity&rsquo;, the delay in lockdown, and the absence of a work strategy that prioritised safety after the summer, caused among the most appalling death rates in the world, worse than Trump&rsquo;s America. However, a swift change in the job security policy stemmed mass unemployment, after initial reports of 2.1 million people claiming unemployment benefits. The &lsquo;Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme&rsquo; eventually meant that the unemployment statistics (as opposed to claimant count) showed only a modest jobless rise. Comparison with the US where there are effectively no rights, and other countries with strong rights, shows that universal social security and workplace democracy are at the core of successful economic performance. This paper explains the UK&rsquo;s health and safety rights, how the job retention scheme was unfurled with extension to employed and self-employed, and the connection between votes at work and employment. It shows how reality discredits the minority views of economic theorists who oppose labour rights, and suggests the legal reforms we can undertake to achieve a social recovery.	false

0	First confirmed detection of SARS-COV-2 in untreated municipal and aircraft wastewater in Dubai, UAE: The use of wastewater based epidemiology as an early warning tool to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged inWuhan, China and spread to more than 114 countries resulting in a pandemic, whichwas declared by the WHO in March 2020. Tracking the spread of the virus raised a main concern in every country. Many researches proved the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples of patients, where the genes of this virus gave a positive signal several days prior to the occurrence of symptoms. The fact of viral shedding in stools provides an advantage in utilizing wastewater systems as a tool to monitor the viral prevalence. We tested more than 2900 municipal wastewater samples coming from 49 distinctive area in Dubai, where 28.6% showed positive results. We also looked into the wastewater samples from 198 commercial aircrafts arriving at Dubai Airport, giving a positive result percentage of 13.6%. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes was confirmed using TaqPathT Covid-19 RT-PCR kit, which targets ORF1ab, N gene and S gene. This project shows the significance of utilizing wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in monitoring the prevalence of various infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, which can assist the decisionmakers to determine the level of precautionarymeasures according to the areas of the outbreak. With this in mind, pricewise, WBE is considered cost-effective when comparing to clinical nasal swabs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Understanding Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Blacks. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected communities of color, with blacks experiencing the highest rates of disease severity and mortality. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to reduce the race mortality gap from COVID-19; however, hesitancy of the vaccine in the black community threatens vaccine uptake., METHODS: We conducted focus groups with black barbershop and salon owners living in zip codes of elevated COVID-19 prevalence to assess their attitudes, beliefs, and norms around a COVID-19 vaccine. We used a modified grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts., RESULTS: We completed four focus groups (n=24 participants) in July and August 2020. Participants were an average age of 46, 89% were black non-Hispanic. Hesitancy against the COVID-19 vaccine was high due to mistrust in the medical establishment, concerns with the accelerated timeline for vaccine development, limited data on short and long-term side effects, and the political environment promoting racial injustice. Some participants were willing to consider the vaccine once the safety profile is robust and reassuring. Receiving a recommendation to take the vaccine from a trusted health care provider served as a facilitator. Health beliefs identified were similar to concerns around other vaccines, and included the fear of getting the infection with vaccination, and preferring to improve one's baseline physical health through alternative therapies., CONCLUSION: We found that hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine was high; however, provider recommendation and transparency around the safety profile might help reduce hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine.

0	Prevalence and potential consequences of child labour in India and the possible impact of COVID-19 - a contemporary overview. Child labour is a global phenomenon occurring predominantly in countries with lower socioeconomic status and resources. Societal and familial poverty, loss or incapacitation/illness of parents, lack of social security and protection, and ignorance about the value of, or limited access to, education are among the myriad reasons for the involvement of children in the workforce. Child labour is a barrier to the development of individual children and their society and economy. Global estimates indicate that 152 million children (64 million girls and 88 million boys) are working, accounting for almost one in 10 of all children worldwide. Currently the COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market consequences are having a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, impoverished families and their children are often the first to suffer, which may push many more vulnerable children into child labour situations. Child labour in India is more prevalent than in many other countries, with approximately 10 million children actively engaged in, or seeking, work. This paper focuses on the issue of child labour, its causes and its ill effects. Further, it also reviews the international legal framework relating to child labour and legislative issues in India. There is clearly an urgent need for this issue to be effectively addressed and resolved.	false
0	"Two pandemics of the 21st century: Covid-19 and swine flu of 2009. This brief analytical review is devoted to spreading, etiology, pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment of COVID-19 and ""swine flu"" causing pandemics in the 21st century. Both pandemics were caused by respiratory viruses belonging to different families, i.e., Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV-2) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus), respectively. In most cases, pathogens enter human organisms via epithelial cells of the upper airways. Sometimes, these viruses infect intestinal epithelium. Given that symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar, its diagnostics should always be based on laboratory results, especially, PCR evidence for specific RNA presence in clinical material. The paper describes similarities and differences in immune pathogenesis of the diseases. The main characteristics of two pandemic courses caused by SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 are revealed. The presence of influenza vaccine and etiotropic chemotherapeutic agents, as well as preexisting immunity to influenza virus among elderly people in 2009 had a significant influence on morbidity and mortality during the influenza pandemic. The presence of antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in sera of elderly people before the pandemic can be explained by the fact that some antigenic properties of A(H1N1) virus which circulated before 1957 were similar to that of A/California/07/09 (H1N1)pdm09. Consequently, morbidity and mortality among people older than 65 (main risk group) were low, while children and young adults suffered more often. The opposite pattern is observed for COVID-19, since mortality among the elderly population is high, while the children and young adults have an asymptomatic or mild form of a disease. A suggestion is made that population in the South-East Asia may have immunity against SARS-CoV-2, since coronaviruses with antigenic features similar to the pandemic one could circulate in that region and infect population without evident symptoms, while one or several recent virus variants caused severe disease and COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.Copyright © 2020 Russian Association of Allergologists and Clinical Immunologists, St. Petersburg Regional Branch (SPb RAACI).

0	COVID-19 Antibody Tests: A Valuable Public Health Tool with Limited Relevance to Individuals. Antibody tests for detecting past infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have many uses for public health decision making, but demand has largely come from individual consumers. This review focuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in detecting prior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer about future immunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future importance of antibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and necessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be used to inform individual decision making, and antibody testing should remain a tool of public health at this time.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 variants show resistance to neutralization by many monoclonal and serum-derived polyclonal antibodies. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic infecting more than 106 million people and causing 2.3 million deaths. The rapid deployment of antibody-based countermeasures has provided hope for curtailing disease and ending the pandemic 1 . However, the emergence of rapidly-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and elsewhere with mutations in the spike protein has raised concern for escape from neutralizing antibody responses and loss of vaccine efficacy based on preliminary data with pseudoviruses 2-4 . Here, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), animal immune sera, human convalescent sera, and human sera from recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine, we report the impact on antibody neutralization of a panel of authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including a B.1.1.7 isolate, a chimeric Washington strain with a South African spike gene (Wash SA-B.1.351), and isogenic recombinant variants with designed mutations or deletions at positions 69-70, 417, 484, 501, and/or 614 of the spike protein. Several highly neutralizing mAbs engaging the receptor binding domain (RBD) or N-terminal domain (NTD) lost inhibitory activity against Wash SA-B.1.351 or recombinant variants with an E484K spike mutation. Most convalescent sera and virtually all mRNA vaccine-induced immune sera tested showed markedly diminished neutralizing activity against the Wash SA-B.1.351 strain or recombinant viruses containing mutations at position 484 and 501. We also noted that cell line selection used for growth of virus stocks or neutralization assays can impact the potency of antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, which has implications for assay standardization and congruence of results across laboratories. As several antibodies binding specific regions of the RBD and NTD show loss-of-neutralization potency in vitro against emerging variants, updated mAb cocktails, targeting of highly conserved regions, enhancement of mAb potency, or adjustments to the spike sequences of vaccines may be needed to prevent loss of protection in vivo .	false
0	Integrated immune dynamics define correlates of COVID-19 severity and antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2 causes a spectrum of COVID-19 disease, the immunological basis of which remains ill-defined. We analysed 85 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals at acute and/or convalescent timepoints, up to 102 days post-symptom onset, quantifying 184 immunological parameters. Acute COVID-19 presented with high levels of IL-6, IL-18 and IL-10 and broad activation marked by upregulation of CD38 on innate and adaptive lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Importantly, activated CXCR3+cTFH1 cells in acute COVID-19 significantly correlate with and predict antibody levels and their avidity at convalescence as well as acute neutralisation activity. Strikingly, intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of soluble IL-6, IL-6R, IL-18, and hyperactivation of innate, adaptive and myeloid compartments than patients with moderate disease. Our analyses provide a comprehensive map of longitudinal immunological responses in COVID-19 patients and integrate key cellular pathways of complex immune networks underpinning severe COVID-19, providing important insights into potential biomarkers and immunotherapies.

0	Clinical findings in a group of COVID-19 patients: A single-center retrospective study. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly across countries and has infected tens of millions of people all over the world. So far, the pandemic is ongoing globally, and the situation is still worsening. Method(s): In this retrospective, single-center cohort analysis, we included 25 adult inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease from the affiliated hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (Xuzhou, China). Epidemiological characterizations, clinical findings, and medical treatments were all reported. In addition, laboratory markers were investigated in terms of course of treatment. Result(s): Epidemiological features and clinical findings were present for all 25 patients. Laboratory markers were identified due to temporal changes. After medical treatment, all patients were discharged home and recovering from the infection. Conclusion(s): This study provides a comprehensive overview of patients with COVID-19 disease in a single hospital. Some of the laboratory markers were statistically different during the course of the disease, which might serve as indicators in identifying patients with COVID-19 disease at an early stage of the infection.Copyright © 2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.	false
0	"Interactive anesthesiology educational program improves wellness for anesthesiologists and their children. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Anesthesiologists have a high prevalence of burnout with adverse effects on professionalism and safety. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an interactive anesthesiology educational program on the wellness of anesthesia providers and their children, as assessed by a modified Professional Fulfillment Index., DESIGN: Prospective observational study., SETTING: Perioperative area., PATIENTS: Thirty clinicians participated in the program. Twenty respondents, representing 67% of participants and each corresponding to a parent and their child or children, completed the post-event survey., INTERVENTIONS: An interactive anesthesiology educational program incorporating children, between the ages of five and eighteen years old, of anesthesia providers was held in the perioperative area. The program was held over four hours and was comprised of four sessions including pediatric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, airway, and ultrasound stations., MEASUREMENTS: Anesthesia providers and their children were administered a post-event assessment, including a modified Professional Fulfillment Index and satisfaction survey., MAIN RESULTS: All twenty (100%) of respondents indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that their child was happy with the program, and that it was worthwhile and satisfying to both the anesthesia provider and their child. Nineteen (95%) of reporting participants indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that it was meaningful to have the department host such a program and 17 (85%) respondents felt their child now better understands the anesthesia work of the parent. All clinician volunteers indicated it was ""very true"" or ""completely true"" that they were contributing professionally during the program in ways that they valued most., CONCLUSION: An interactive educational wellness initiative provides an effective and feasible method for increasing professional fulfillment and satisfaction among anesthesia providers while educating our youngest generation of learners. Implementation of such a program may also occur with modifications such as televideo to maintain COVID-19 precautions. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."	false
0	Asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus disease 2019 among healthcare workers in Isfahan, Iran. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Isfahan, Iran. Materials & methods: HCWs in COVID-19 wards of three referral COVID-19 hospitals in Isfahan were screened and tested for COVID-19 infection. Results: In total, 102 HCWs were screened whose median age was 43 years old. Moreover, 21 (20.5%) of them had a history of suspected infection with SARS-CoV2, mostly (66.6%) without any symptoms while six (28.5%) of them suffered from relatively mild diseases and one (4.7%) was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: It was found that HCWs were prone to be asymptomatic carriers while their computed tomography images were normal. Therefore, it is recommended that reverse-transcriptase real-time-PCR be essential for the diagnosis of infections.	false
0	Covid-19 in Children and Young Adolescents in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates- a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study. Aim: In this retrospective single-center study, we report our experience with a cohort of children admitted to our hospital in Al Ain City, United Arab Emirates, with confirmed COVID-19. We also compare our findings to similar reports in the literature. Patients and Methods: Between 1st March and 31st May 2020, we reviewed the electronic patient medical records of all children with confirmed COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) managed in Al Ain hospital, designated as the only COVID-19 center in the city. Results: There were 288 children admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 during the study period (mean age 7.3 years, median 6.5, range 1 month to 16.9 years). The age-specific point prevalence was the highest under the age of 5 years (mean 2.0 per 1,000, 95% ci 1.7, 2.4) and decreased progressively to 0.6 per 1,000 (95% ci 0.4, 0.9) over the age of 14 years. Hospital admission was required for 193 (67%) children while 95 (33%) were discharged from the emergency department. Most children (n = 214, 74%) had been exposed to a family member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and asthma which was the most frequent comorbidity (n = 37, 13%). The most common symptoms were cough (n = 130, 45%), fever (n = 14, 4.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 93, 32.3%), and lower respiratory tract infection in 28 (9.7%). None of the children presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, neurological symptoms, sepsis, or septic shock. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count or ANC< 1.5 x 10(9)/L) was observed in 10.4% and thrombocytopenia (<150 platelets x 10(9)/L) in 72% of children. Nineteen patients (9%) had abnormal imaging studies (chest X-ray and chest computed tomography). Abnormalities were bilateral in six (43%), right-sided in seven (50%) with only one child (7%) with left-sided involvement. None of the children required invasive respiratory support, but four (1.4%) required noninvasive respiratory support. The median length of hospital stay was 3.3 days [1.9, 5.9]. There were no deaths in the hospital even in those with comorbidities. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous reports of mild illness of COVID-19 in our child population, even in those with comorbidities. The age-standardized prevalence was higher in children (<5 years) compared to young adolescents.	false
0	Review Study of Digital Health-related Solutions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis for the 10 Highest Prevalent Countries. BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a case of pneumonia becomes a global pandemic, affecting most of the countries around the world. digital health as information technologies that can be applied in three aspects including digital patients, digital devices, and digital clinics could help against this pandemic., OBJECTIVE: Recent reviews have examined the role of digital health in controlling COVID-19 to identify the potential of digital health to fight against the disease. However, this study is aimed at reviewing and analyzing applied digital technology to control the COVID-19 pandemic in ten countries with the highest prevalence of the disease., METHODS: For this review, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in August 2020 to retrieve publications from December 2019 to 15 March 2020. Furthermore, the Google search engine was also investigated to identify additional applications of digital health for COVID-19 pandemic control., RESULTS: 32 papers were included in this review reported 37 digital health applications for COVID-19 control. Most of the projects for COVID-19 fighting were telemedicine visit (N=11, 30%). Digital learning packages for informing about the disease (N=7, 19%), GIS and QR code application for real-time case tracking (N=7, 19%), as well as cloud /mobile based systems for self-care and patient tracking (N=7, 19%) were in the second rank of digital tool applications. projects deployed by collaboration of European countries, USA, Australia, and China., CONCLUSIONS: Having considered the potential of available information technologies across the world in the 21st century, particularly in developed countries, it seems that more digital health products with higher level of intelligence capability have remained to be applied for pandemic and health related crisis management., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Potential False-Positive and False-Negative Results for COVID-19 IgG/IgM Antibody Testing After Heat-Inactivation. Objectives: With the worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), various antibody detection kits have been developed to test for SARS-CoV-2- specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody. However, the use of different testing methods under various heat-inactivation conditions might affect the COVID-19 detection results. Methods: Seven different antibody detection kits produced by four manufacturers for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and total antibody were tested at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China. Most of the kits used the indirect immunity, capture, and double-antigen sandwich methods. The effects of various heat-inactivation conditions on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody detection were analyzed for the different test methods. Results: Using the indirect immunity method, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody significantly increased and those for IgM antibody decreased with increasing temperature of heat-inactivation using indirect immunity method. However, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and total antibody showed no change when the capture and double-antigen sandwich methods were used. The changes in IgG and IgM antibody values with the indirect immunity method indicated that heat-inactivation could affect COVID-19 detection results obtained using this method. In particular, 18 (22.2%) SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive samples were detected as negative with heat-inactivation at 65 degrees C for 30 min, and one (25%) IgG negative sample was detected as positive after heat-inactivation at 56 degrees C for 60 min and 60 degrees C for 30 min. Conclusions: Heat-inactivation could increase SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody values, and decrease IgM antibody values, causing potential false-positive or false-negative results for COVID-19 antibody detection using the indirect immunity method. Thus, before conducting antibody testing, the testing platforms should be evaluated in accordance with the relevant requirements to ensure accurate COVID-19 detection results.	false
0	"Sentiment analysis of user feedback on the HSE's Covid-19 contact tracing app. BACKGROUND: Digital Contact Tracing is seen as a key tool in reducing the propagation of Covid-19. But it requires high uptake and continued participation across the population to be effective. To achieve sufficient uptake/participation, health authorities should address, and thus be aware of, user concerns., AIM: This work manually analyzes user reviews of the Irish Heath Service Executive's (HSE) Contact Tracker app, to identify user concerns and to lay the foundations for subsequent, large-scale, automated analyses of reviews. While this might seem tightly scoped to the Irish context, the HSE app provides the basis for apps in many jurisdictions in the USA and Europe., METHODS: Manual analysis of (1287) user reviews from the Google/Apple playstores was performed, to identify the aspects of the app that users focused on, and the positive/negative sentiment expressed., RESULTS: The findings suggest a largely positive sentiment towards the app, and that users thought it handled data protection and transparency aspects well. But feedback suggests that users would appreciate more targeted feedback on the incidence of the virus, and facilities for more proactive engagement, like notifications that prompt users to submit their health status daily. Finally, the analysis suggests that the ""android battery"" issue and the backward-compatibility issue with iPhones seriously impacted retention/uptake of the app respectively., CONCLUSION: The HSE have responded to the public's desire for targeted feedback in newer versions, but should consider increasing the app's proactive engagement. The results suggest they should also raise the backward compatibility issue, regarding older iPhones, with Apple."	false

The current COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly into one of the most devastating public health crises in recent history. By mid-July 2020, reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000 deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness, hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able to express the non-stationary relationships among variables. Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.	false
0	Pre-existing and post-COVID-19 immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients. Cancer patients, in particular patients with hematological malignancies, are at increased risk for critical illness upon COVID-19. We here assessed antibody as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in unexposed and SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients to characterize SARS-CoV‑2 immunity and to identify immunological parameters contributing to COVID-19 outcome. Unexposed patients with hematological malignancies presented with reduced prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4 + T cell responses and signs of T cell exhaustion when compared to solid tumor patients and healthy volunteers. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses did not differ between COVID-19 cancer patients and healthy volunteers, intensity, expandability, and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses were profoundly reduced in cancer patients, and the latter associated with a severe course of COVID-19. This identifies impaired SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity as determinant for dismal outcome of COVID-19 in cancer patients.	false
0	The ACE2-binding Interface of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Inherently Deflects Immune Recognition. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat, and host immunity remains the main mechanism of protection against the disease. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID-19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

0	Covid-19 and leptospirosis: Cytokine storm and the use of steroids. The majority of patients with Covid-19 have a good outcome. However, complications principally of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure can occur rapidly. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease, is similar to Covid-19 in that most infections are mild or asymptomatic and only a small number develop ARDS. Cytokine storm is considered to be the main incriminating factor in both. High dose steroids have been used to ameliorate the effects in leptospirosis, and similarly, reports suggest a benefit in Covid-19. SARS CoV-2 and leptospira, one a virus and the other a bacterium, are two species separated by millions of years of evolution, but producing illnesses with similar spectra, with cytokine storm being the common precipitating factor. As data are accrued from around the world, more light may be shed on features analogous to both pathways.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Comparison of diagnostic accuracy for eight SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests have been suggested as an additional diagnostic tool in highly suspected cases with a negative molecular test and determination of seroprevalence in population. We compared the diagnostic performance of eight commercial serological assays for IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus., Materials and methods: The comparison study was performed on a total of 76 serum samples: 30 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative and 46 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients with asymptomatic to severe disease and symptoms duration from 3-30 days. The study included: three rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and three chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA)., Results: Agreement between IgM assays were minimal to moderate (kappa 0.26 to 0.63) and for IgG moderate to excellent (kappa 0.72 to 0.92). Sensitivities improved with > 10 days of symptoms and were: 30% to 89% for IgM; 89% to 100% for IgG; 96% for IgA; 100% for IgA/IgM combination; 96% for total antibodies. Overall specificities were: 90% to 100% for IgM; 85% to 100% for IgG; 90% for IgA; 70% for IgA/IgM combination; 100% for total antibodies. Diagnostic accuracy for IgG ELISA and CIA assays were excellent (AUC >= 0.90), without significant difference. IgA showed significantly better diagnostic accuracy than IgM (P < 0.001)., Conclusion: There is high variability between IgM assays independently of the assay format, while IgG assays showed moderate to perfect agreement. The appropriate time for testing is crucial for the proper immunity investigation. Copyright Croatian Society of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine.	false

HIV healthcare providers might be vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by the stress and coping paradigm, the current study aimed at examining the interactive effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping on mental health problems. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the current study was 13.31% and 6.61%, respectively. Results from path analyses revealed that the main effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping were significant on both depression and anxiety. The interaction of coping and COVID-19-related stressors had significant effects on depression and anxiety. Simple slope tests revealed that more coping behaviors buffered against the negative effect of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health problems. Coping acted as a protective factor that alleviated the harm of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health. Intervention targeting coping management might benefit the mental health of HIV healthcare providers.	false
0	Cloth masks in public places: an essential intervention to prevent COVID-19 in Brazil. There is increasing evidence that the use of masks is an indispensable protective measure against COVID-19, given the high transmissibility of the new coronavirus through the respiratory system, including by asymptomatic individuals. The use of cloth masks in public places has been established as a protective measure to be adopted alongside social distancing and hand hygiene. This narrative review aims to systematize the scientific evidence that informs the widespread use of cloth masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19 and to describe the evolution of positions contrary to or in favor of its use outside the home, in view of the advance of the new coronavirus pandemic globally. The scientific articles, technical notes, governmental decrees and other documents analyzed indicate that widespread use of masks has the potential to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus. We recommend that the Brazilian government adopt strategies to increase the supply of reusable cloth masks to the public, especially to vulnerable populations and to support studies on the impact of this measure to control the pandemic in the country. Finally, it is imperative to ensure that use of masks does not exacerbate stigmatization of racial groups that already face prejudice.	false
0	Cardiac Manifestations, Treatment Characteristics, and Outcomes of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2: systematic review of case reports and case series. Objective: To investigate cardiac manifestations, treatment characteristics, and outcomes of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS)., Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases and qualitatively synthesized findings from studies., Results: Twenty-six studies were included with 1228 pooled subjects, with a mean age of 8.6 years, which were dominated by male gender (53%), and African ethnicity (31%). 732 (38%) patients were reactive on a serological test, and 457 patients (45%) were positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. ST-segment abnormalities were the most common ECG findings (16%, n/N: 34/212). Various markers of troponin and the pooled mean of BNP and NT-pro-BNP levels were elevated. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion (21.8%, n/N: 164/751) was the most common chest X-ray findings. In echocardiography, the majority of patients' left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (59.0%, n/N: 180/305), with pericardial effusion/ pericarditis seen the most (17.44%, n/N: 221/1267), and Z score >= 2 in 28% (n/N: 42/139). Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and vasoactive drugs were frequently utilized. The mean length of stay was 6 days, with most patients (71%, n/N: 834/1163) were admitted to the ICU. However, the overall prognosis was favourable, with 98% alive (n/N: 1235/1260), and more than 50% of patients experienced recovery of left ventricular systolic functions at discharge (116 out of 206 patients)., Conclusion: PIMS-TS is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a multiorgan system dysfunction, especially acute cardiac injury, and mandates a higher level of care.Nevertheless, when appropriate treatments are available, the cardiac function rapidly reverted to normal in most cases, and it was associated with a favourable outcome in general. Of concern, medium and long-term prognosis remains to be elucidated. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	The Main Molecular and Serological Methods for Diagnosing COVID-19: An Overview Based on the Literature. Diagnostic tests have been considered as the main alternative for the control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a correct diagnosis allows for decision making when facing the disease, particularly as there is a lack of effective therapeutic protocols and vaccines. Thus, in this review, we summarized the main diagnostic approaches currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans based on studies available in article databases. The tests can be organized into two main categories: nucleic acid-based tests, recommended for the initial detection of the virus, and serological tests, recommended for assessing the disease progression. The studies have shown that the performance of diagnostic methods depends on different factors, such as the type of samples and the characteristics of each assay. It was identified that the positivity of the tests is mainly related to the onset of symptoms. We also observed that point-of-care diagnoses are considered as one of the main trends in this area, due to the low-cost and simplicity of the assay; however, the analytical performance must be critically analyzed. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of diagnostic technologies in the control of infectious diseases.	false
0	The use of checklists to improve safety in each step of the peri-operative period of critical care patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy. COVID-19 is an emerging viral illness, which can cause severe cardiorespiratory illness. Severe COVID-19 can require prolonged invasive ventilation and cause supraglottic and laryngeal oedema, requiring extended ventilator wean and necessitating tracheostomy. These tracheostomies should be performed by experienced operators in a controlled environment. Our ear-nose-throat (ENT), critical care and anaesthetic departments discussed the safest and most resource efficient way to provide such a service and decided upon a surgical approach for tracheostomies in theatre. Like many during the pandemic, our site was subject to a number of challenges: an increase in number and acuity of patients requiring critical care or anaesthetic intervention; reduced staffing due to sickness or shielding and a high demand for surgical tracheostomies from a team that did not perform a large number yearly. As such, performing tracheostomies in these patients presents a number of safety issues. Methods Using national guidance, we developed a series of checklists that follow the patient's clinical pathway from the intensive treatment unit (ITU) to/from theatre. An individual checklist was used for preparing the patient on ITU, patient transfer to theatre and in theatre to prepare for and complete the procedure. Their goals were to ensure patient suitability for transfer and tracheostomy; aid communication between multidisciplinary staff; reduce time delays; ensure adequate equipment; guide technical procedures; and to keep the patient safe and reduce the risk to staff by unnecessary aerosolising procedures. Results The checklists were developed early in the management of the pandemic to be implemented in all tracheostomies performed from that point. The checklists were used in seven cases with copies filed in the notes. All of these tracheostomies were attended by two anaesthetists and two ENT surgeons. All of the patients underwent the procedure without adverse incident, have been decannulated and discharged from ITU. Discussion Endemic or pandemic outbreaks of respiratory infections can put huge pressures on health services. When performing high-risk and highly technical procedures, these pressures can increase the risk of human error leading to adverse outcomes, worsening staff stress and misuse of resources. We have found that the use of a pathway of checklists to form tracheostomies in critically ill patients can improve communication and may improve safety during a high-risk peri-operative episode.	false
0	Gastroenterology manifestations and COVID-19 outcomes: A meta-analysis of 25,252 cohorts among the first and second waves. BACKGROUND AND AIM: A meta-analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during the first and second pandemic waves and investigate their association with the disease outcomes. METHOD(S): A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EMBASE was performed up to July 25, 2020. The pooled prevalence of the GI presentations was estimated using the random-effects model. Pairwise comparison for the outcomes was performed according to the GI manifestations' presentation and the pandemic wave of infection. Data were reported as relative risk (RR), or odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULT(S): Of 125 articles with 25,252 patients, 20.3% presented with GI manifestations. Anorexia (19.9%), dysgeusia/ageusia (15.4%), diarrhea (13.2%), nausea (10.3%), and hematemesis (9.1%) were the most common. About 26.7% had confirmed positive fecal RNA, with persistent viral shedding for an average time of 19.2 days before being negative. Patients presenting with GI symptoms on admission showed a higher risk of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR=8.16), acute cardiac injury (RR=5.36), and acute kidney injury (RR=5.52), ICU admission (RR=2.56), and mortality (RR=2.01). Although not reach significant levels, subgroup-analysis revealed that affected cohorts in the first wave had a higher risk of being hospitalized, ventilated, ICU admitted, and expired. CONCLUSION(S): This meta-analysis suggests an association between GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients and unfavorable outcomes. The analysis also showed improved overall outcomes for COVID-19 patients during the second wave compared to the first wave of the outbreak. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Persistent COVID-19-associated neurocognitive symptoms in non-hospitalized patients. As cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mount worldwide, attention is needed on potential long-term neurologic impacts for the majority of patients who experience mild to moderate illness managed as outpatients. To date, there has not been discussion of persistent neurocognitive deficits in patients with milder COVID-19. We present two cases of non-hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19 with persistent neurocognitive symptoms. Commonly used cognitive screens were normal, while more detailed testing revealed working memory and executive functioning deficits. An observational cohort study of individuals recovering from COVID-19 (14 or more days following symptom onset) identified that among the first 100 individuals enrolled, 14 were non-hospitalized patients reporting persistent cognitive issues. These 14 participants had a median age of 39 years (interquartile range: 35-56), and cognitive symptoms were present for at least a median of 98 days (interquartile range: 71-120 following acute COVID-19 symptoms); no participants with follow-up evaluation reported symptom resolution. We discuss potential mechanisms to be explored in future studies, including direct viral effects, indirect consequences of immune activation, and immune dysregulation causing auto-antibody production.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Characteristics and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first 28 days of the spring and autumn pandemic waves in Milan: An observational prospective study. Background: The therapeutic approach to COVID-19 and healthcare system preparedness improved during 2020. We compared characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first 28 days of the March and October pandemic waves in Milan, Italy. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective, observational study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia during March 7-April 4 (1st period) and October 15-November 12 (2nd period). During the 1st period hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and therapeutic enoxaparin when thrombosis was confirmed were administered; systemic corticosteroids were given in case of severe pneumonia. During the 2nd period dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, remdesivir, thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation were administered according to international recommendations. Patients with respiratory distress on oxygen masks initiated CPAP. Outcomes were: length of hospital stay, all-cause in-hospital mortality and need for intubation. Result(s): We included 70 patients (75% males) during the 1st and 76 patients (51% males, p = 0.522) during the 2nd period. Prevalence of severe respiratory failure (30% vs. 12%, p = 0.006), and D-dimer >3000 FEU (34% vs. 15%, P = 0.012) were reduced during the 2nd period, while anticoagulation and corticosteroids were more frequently administered (both p < 0.01). Mortality and time to referral were also reduced (39.4% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.019 and 6 vs. 5 days, p = 0.014), while need for intubation didn't change. Hospitalization length was comparable, but the proportion of patients discharged home was higher during the 2nd period (28.2% vs. 55.4%, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Changing treatment paradigms and early referral might have reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients. The effects of specific therapeutic regimens needs further confirmation in future clinical studies.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill pediatric patients admitted to the intensive care unit: A multicenter retrospective cohort study. Background: Characteristics of critical Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is not well understood. This study described the clinical characteristics of children admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and explored factors associated with the need for invasive ventilation or mortality. Method(s): A multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was conducted over eight medical centers, including all patients younger than 18 years of age and admitted to the ICU due to a direct consequence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients who were admitted to the ICU for any alternate reason and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by screening test, and patients who were admitted due to multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, were excluded. Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and clinical data were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare survivors and non-survivors. Fine and Gray's hazard model was used to estimate the association between clinical variables and ICU death. Result(s): During the study period, 25 pediatric COVID-19 patients received care in the ICUs. The median age was 2.78 years (IQR 0.21-8.51), and 60% were male. Only three patients were reported to be previously healthy at admission. Nine (36%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, including two were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Four (16%) patients died during ICU care. In univariate analysis, the presence of comorbidity (HR 0.0001; 95%CI 0.00001-0.00016), platelets count (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99), elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.05; 95%CI 1.016-1.09), and circulatory compromise (HR 16.34; 95%CI 1.99-134.35), all at the time of ICU admission, were associated with in-ICU mortality. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that children admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 infection, generally, have a favorable outcome. Low platelets count, elevated procalcitonin, presence of comorbidity, and shock at the time of ICU admission were associated with death. This study may shed more light on the disease dynamics of critical pediatric COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	High expression of CD38 and MHC class II on CD8+ T cells during severe influenza disease reflects bystander activation and trogocytosis. Although co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8 + T cells reflects activation during influenza, SARS-CoV-2, Dengue, Ebola and HIV-1 viral infections, high and prolonged CD38 + HLA-DR + expression can be associated with severe and fatal disease outcomes. As the expression of CD38 + HLA-DR + is poorly understood, we used mouse models of influenza A/H7N9, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 infection to investigate the mechanisms underpinning CD38 + MHC-II + phenotype on CD8 + T-cells. Our analysis of influenza-specific immunodominant D b NP 366 +CD8 + T-cell responses showed that CD38 + MHC-II + co-expression was detected on both virus-specific and bystander CD8 + T-cells, with increased numbers of both CD38 + MHC-II + CD8 + T-cell populations observed in the respiratory tract during severe infection. To understand the mechanisms underlying CD38 and MHC-II expression, we also used adoptively-transferred transgenic OT-I CD8 + T-cells recognising the ovalbumin-derived K b SIINFEKL epitope and A/H1N1-SIINKEKL infection. Strikingly, we found that OT-I cells adoptively-transferred into MHC-II −/− mice did not display MHC-II after influenza virus infection, suggesting that MHC-II was acquired via trogocytosis in wild-type mice. Additionally, detection of CD19 on CD38 + MHC II + OT-I cells further supports that MHC-II was acquired by trogocytosis, at least partially, sourced from B-cells. Our results also revealed that co-expression of CD38 + MHC II + on CD8 + T-cells was needed for the optimal recall ability following secondary viral challenge. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38 + MHC-II + CD8 + T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells. Our findings also highlight the importance of the CD38 + MHC II + phenotype for CD8 + T-cell memory establishment and recall. <h4>Summary</h4> Co-expression of CD38 and MHC-II on CD8 + T cells is recognized as a classical hallmark of activation during viral infections. High and prolonged CD38 + HLA-DR + expression, however, can be associated with severe disease outcomes and the mechanisms are unclear. Using our established influenza wild-type and transgenic mouse models, we determined how disease severity affected the activation of influenza-specific CD38 + MHC-II + CD8 + T cell responses in vivo and the antigenic determinants that drive their activation and expansion. Overall, our study provides evidence that both virus-specific and bystander CD38 + MHC-II + CD8 + T-cells are recruited to the site of infection during severe disease, and that MHC-II expression occurs, at least in part, via trogocytosis from antigen-presenting cells. Our findings also highlight the importance of the CD38 + MHC II + phenotype for CD8 + T-cell memory establishment and recall.	false
0	The potential effectiveness of the WHO International Health Regulations capacity requirements on control of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of 114 countries. OBJECTIVES: We examined if the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities were associated with better COVID-19 pandemic control., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Population-based study of 114 countries., PARTICIPANTS: General population., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index., RESULTS: Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence (beta coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality (beta coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association., CONCLUSIONS: The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.	false

0	Interactions between seasonal human coronaviruses and implications for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective study in Stockholm, Sweden, 2009-2020. OBJECTIVES: The four seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are frequent causes of respiratory infections and show annual and seasonal variation. Increased understanding about these patterns could be informative about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Results from PCR diagnostics for the seasonal coronaviruses, and other respiratory viruses, were obtained for 55,190 clinical samples analyzed at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, between 14 September 2009 and 2 April 2020., RESULTS: Seasonal coronaviruses were detected in 2130 samples (3.9 %) and constituted 8.1 % of all virus detections. OC43 was most commonly detected (28.4 % of detections), followed by NL63 (24.0 %), HKU1 (17.6 %), and 229E (15.3 %). The overall fraction of positive samples was similar between seasons, but at species level there were distinct biennial alternating peak seasons for the Alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and the Betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, respectively. The Betacoronaviruses peaked earlier in the winter season (Dec-Jan) than the Alphacoronaviruses (Feb-Mar). Coronaviruses were detected across all ages, but diagnostics were more frequently requested for paediatric patients than adults and the elderly. OC43 and 229E incidence was relatively constant across age strata, while that of NL63 and HKU1 decreased with age., CONCLUSIONS: Both the Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses showed alternating biennial winter incidence peaks, which suggests some type of immune mediated interaction. Symptomatic reinfections in adults and the elderly appear relatively common. Both findings may be of relevance for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

0	Prevalence of olfactory and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 patients: a community care facility study. PURPOSE: We aim to study the prevalence of olfactory and taste dysfunction (OTD) in subjects residing in a Community Care Facility (CCF), a center unique to Singapore that is dedicated to isolate foreign workers with COVID-19 infection who have mild disease with minimal or no symptoms., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study analyzing data prospectively collected from COVID-19-positive subjects who were admitted into a single-center Singapore EXPO CCF from 1st May 2020 to 1st July 2020. The following variables were collected: age, gender, ethnicity, anosmia, ageusia and acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. Symptoms of anosmia and ageusia were self-declared via a mandatory questionnaire administered on admission., RESULTS: A total of 1983 subjects were included. The overall prevalence of anosmia and ageusia is 3.0% and 2.6%, respectively. 58% of anosmic subjects have co-existent ageusia and 72.6% of anosmic subjects have no concurrent sinonasal symptoms. OTD is less likely to present in subjects who are asymptomatic for ARI, compared to those symptomatic for ARI (anosmia: 2.0% versus 4.4% p = 0.002; ageusia: 1.6% versus 4.2% p < 0.001). There is a difference in the prevalence of OTD between the different ethnic groups (Indian, Chinese, Bangladeshi and Others), with Chinese and Bangladeshi reporting a higher prevalence (p < 0.043) CONCLUSION: The true prevalence of OTD in COVID-19-positive subjects may be low with aggressive screening of all subjects, including those asymptomatic for ARI.	false
0	[Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 test strategy in a southwestern university hospital at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic]. BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published several guidelines addressing the medical health services helping to detect SARS CoV-2. Needing an available and specific test strategy regarding SARS-CoV-2, our own test strategy strictly followed these testing criteria., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective analysis, we verified if such a test strategy was an effective tool in the context of infection prevention control and as reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection. Therefore, we analysed our own test results of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases between 26 February and 6 April 2020. Additionally, we used a geovisualisation tool to visualise test frequencies and positive test results within different districts of Mannheim based on people's addresses., RESULTS: There were on average 7% positive test results of SARS-CoV-2 within a population with typical symptoms of COVID-19 (n= 2808). There was no positive test result within an asymptomatic population (n= 448). However, one positive test result turned out to be a nosocomial infection. Finally, geovisualisation highlighted a shift of test frequencies and local positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 from one district of Mannheim to another., DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our test strategy strictly based on testing criteria suggested by the Robert Koch Institute resulted in a steady rate of positive tests and allowed us to increase test capacity without causing numbers of nosocomial infections of COVID-19. Geovisualisation tools can offer support in analysing an ongoing spread of transmissible diseases. In the future, they could be used as helpful tools for infection prevention control, for example in the context of vaccination programs.	false
0	Background to new treatments for COVID-19, including its chronicity, through altering elements of the cytokine storm. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals, Dexamethasone and rIL-7 are of considerable interest in treating COVID-19 patients who are in danger of, or have become, seriously ill. Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well-conducted human trials. Newer information with anti-TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID-19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti-TNF biologicals on community-acquired COVID-19 during their long-term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL-7Ralpha, the receptor for IL-7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody-based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL-7- enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti-TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL-7, currently being trialed as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID-19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4-positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"Social Support and Aggressive Communication on Social Network Sites during the COVID-19 Pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, use of social networking sites (SNSs) surged in many countries, including the United States. This content analysis of a convenience sample of English language conversations examined how users sought and provided social support on three Western-dominated SNSs, Reddit (N = 100), YouTube (N = 100), and Facebook (N = 100), during the week following the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition to analyzing social support, this study examined aggressive communication, which often leads to undesirable mental health outcomes, on Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook during this period. According to the Social Identity Model of Individuation Effects (SIDE), anonymous environments which codify civil communication norms are more likely to yield prosocial behavior. Results indicate that Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook varied significantly in supportive and aggressive communication prevalence. Reddit users more frequently provided social support than did YouTube and Facebook users. Additionally, Reddit users engaged in aggressive communication significantly less than both YouTube and Facebook users. These findings support predictions from the SIDE model, as Reddit both offers users greater anonymity than YouTube and Facebook and codifies supportive, civil communication norms in a rules system called, ""Reddiquette."""	false
0	SARS-CoV-2, the other face to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV: Future predictions. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is proving to be an unprecedented disaster that lays its dark shadow on global health, economics and personal freedom. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics provide scientific data that is useful in better understanding and resolution of COVID-19. Similarities among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated in the light of available data. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 evolved in bats and have positive-sense RNA genomes of 27.9 kb, 30.1 kb and 29.9 kb, respectively. Molecular and serological tools used for diagnosis of SARS and MERS patients resemble COVID-19 diagnostic tools. Stability and longevity data of SARS and MERS epidemics contribute in the current pandemic precaution policies. Trials to produce vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV failed, therefore different strategies were employed for SARS-CoV2 vaccines production and during the past period antiviral agents, Convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies provide potential treatments for sever patients. The mortality rate caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reached 15% and 37%, respectively. The first declarations about mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was around 2-4% but now this rate differed globally and reached more than 13% in some countries. A realistic COVID-19 outbreak scenario suggest that the pandemic might last for three years with fluctuation in the number of infected cases, unless vaccination process goes faster and/or antiviral drug is discovered.

0	COVID-19 and pregnancy: Case series with diabetes co-morbidity from the registry study 'Covid-19 Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study' (CRONOS). From March 3 to October 13, 2020, 27 cases with diabetes comorbidity have been recorded in the CRONOS registry (Covid-19 Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study in Germany) among 262 registered women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their pregnancy. Of those, 21 presented with gestational diabetes, 5 with type 2 diabetes and 1 with type 1 diabetes. About half of the women were asymptomatic and were diagnosed via general screening at hospital admission. The most common symptoms were nasal congestion, cough, tiredness, malaise and changes in smell and taste. The majority of pregnant women showed a mild to moderate course, three women were admitted to the intensive care unit and none required invasive ventilation. In the type 2 diabetes group, there were two cases with late fetal death (37 and 40 weeks of gestation) and one with a malformation, an association with diabetes being most likely. Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus represent a special subgroup; 1 in 10 women in this small cohort required intensive care monitoring due to COVID-19. In addition, this case series underscores the need for unrestricted access to pregnancy care, especially in times of pandemic, for optimal perinatal outcome.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.	false
0	Pulmonary Thromboembolism and Infarction Mimicking COVID-19 Symptoms; Report of three Cases. Since the novel coronavirus emerged in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, millions of people have been infected and thousands of patients have died. Fever and dyspnea are the most common symptoms of infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, these symptoms are neither specific nor diagnostic for COVID-19. Symptom overlap between COVID-19 and some other conditions may lead other diseases to be missed and underdiagnosed. Just like COVID-19, pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and pulmonary infarction may present with fever and respiratory symptoms. Since COVID-19 emerged and spread worldwide, many clinicians are focused on diagnosis and treatment of this novel viral infection. Hence, other diseases presenting with the same symptoms as COVID-19 may remain underdiagnosed. Here, we report three cases of PTE and pulmonary infarction presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms mimicking COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Archives of Academic EmergencyMedicine, All Rights Reserved	false
0	Pregnancy and COVID-19: pharmacologic considerations. In this review, we summarize evidence regarding the use of routine and investigational pharmacologic interventions for pregnant and lactating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antenatal corticosteroids may be used routinely for fetal lung maturation between 24 and 34weeks' gestation, but decisions in those with critical illness and those <24 or >34weeks' gestation should be made on a case-by-case basis. Magnesium sulfate may be used for seizure prophylaxis and fetal neuroprotection, albeit cautiously in those with hypoxia and renal compromise. There are no contraindications to using low-dose aspirin to prevent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications when indicated. An algorithm for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients with COVID-19 is presented, which considers disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient vs outpatient status, underlying comorbidities and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation. Nitrous oxide may be administered for labor analgesia while using appropriate personal protective equipment. Intravenous remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia should be used with caution in patients with respiratory depression. Liberal use of neuraxial labor analgesia may reduce the need for emergency general anesthesia which results in aerosolization. Short courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be administered for postpartum analgesia, but opioids should be used with caution due to the risk of respiratory depression. For mechanically ventilated pregnant patients, neuromuscular blockade should be used for the shortest duration possible and reversal agents should be available on hand if delivery is imminent. To date, dexamethasone is the only proven and recommended experimental treatment for pregnant patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen. Although hydroxycholoroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir may be used during pregnancy and lactation within the context of clinical trials, data from non-pregnant populations have not shown benefit. The role of monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), immunomodulators (tacrolimus), interferon, inhaled nitric oxide and convalescent plasma in pregnancy and lactation needs further evaluation. © 2020 The Authors.

0	The prevalence and risk factors of depression in prenatal and postnatal women in China with the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression increase with the outbreaks of epidemic disease. The prevalence of depression during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in prenatal and postnatal women was examined in China., METHODS: 2201 prenatal and postnatal women in mainland China were recruited in this cross-sectional study from February 28th to April 26th, 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression in prenatal and postnatal women., RESULTS: The prevalence rate of depression was 35.4%. The risk factors for depression included drinking (p = 0.04; adjusted OR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.26~6.24), nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10~11.44), pregnancy's influence on mobility (p = 0.02; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.11~1.83), anxiety (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.57~1.75), insomnia (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.14~1.21) and daily attention to fetal movement (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.31~0.56)., LIMITATIONS: This study used a cross-sectional design, and cannot compare changes in the incidence of depression before and after the COVID-19 outbreak., CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence rate of depression among Chinese prenatal and postnatal women was 35.4%. Moreover, anxiety, insomnia, drinking, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, as well as the impaired movement and less daily monitoring of fetal movement were risk factors for depression.

0	An original multiplex method to assess five different SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Objectives: Accurate SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed to help diagnose infection, determine past exposure of populations and assess the response to future vaccines. The study aims at assessing the performance of the multiplex D-tek COVIDOT 5 IgG assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (N, S1+S2, S1, S2 and RBD)., Methods: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 218 samples obtained from 46 rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n=118) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with a potential cross-reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis., Results: A gradual dynamic trend since symptom onset was observed for all IgG antibodies. Sensitivities before day 14 were suboptimal. At >=21 days, sensitivities reached 100% (93.4-100%) for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG and 96.3% (87.3-99.6%) for S1-directed IgG. In 42 out of 46 patients (91.3%), all five antibodies were detected at >=14 days. The four remaining patients had between 2 and 4 positive antibodies at their respective maximal follow-up period. The specificity was 100 % for S1+S2, S2 and RBD, 98.3% for N and 92.4% (86.0-96.5%) for S1-directed IgG. The combined use of antigens increases the early sensitivity whilst enforcing high specificity., Conclusions: Sensitivities at >=21 days and specificities were excellent, especially for N, S1+S2, S2 and RBD-directed IgG. Caution is however required when interpreting single S1-directed reactivities. Using a multiplex assay complies with the orthogonal testing algorithm of the CDC and allows a better and critical interpretation of the serological status of a patient.	false
0	Tocilizumab for Severe Worsening COVID-19 Pneumonia: a Propensity Score Analysis. Background: High levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) correlate with disease severity in COVID-19. We hypothesized that tocilizumab (a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor) could improve outcomes in selected patients with severe worsening COVID-19 pneumonia and high inflammatory parameters. Method(s): The TOCICOVID study included a prospective cohort of patients aged 16-80 years with severe (requiring > 6 L/min of oxygen therapy to obtain Sp02 > 94%) rapidly deteriorating (increase by >= 3 L/min of oxygen flow within the previous 12 h) COVID-19 pneumonia with >= 5 days of symptoms and C-reactive protein levels > 40 mg/L. They entered a compassionate use program of treatment with intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/kg with a maximum of 800 mg per infusion; and if needed a second infusion 24 to 72 h later). A control group was retrospectively selected with the same inclusion criteria. Outcomes were assessed at D28 using inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) methodology. Result(s): Among the 96 patients included (81% male, mean (SD) age: 60 (12.5) years), underlying conditions, baseline disease severity, and concomitant medications were broadly similar between the tocilizumab (n = 49) and the control (n = 47) groups. In the IPTW analysis, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduced need for overall ventilatory support (49 vs. 89%, wHR: 0.39 [0.25-0.56]; p < 0.001). Albeit lacking statistical significance, there was a substantial trend towards a reduction of mechanical ventilation (31% vs. 45%; wHR: 0.58 [0.36-0.94]; p = 0.026). However, tocilizumab did not improve overall survival (wHR = 0.68 [0.31-1.748], p = 0.338). Among the 85 (89%) patients still alive at D28, patients treated with tocilizumab had a higher rate of oxygen withdrawal (82% vs. 73.5%, wHR = 1.66 [1.17-2.37], p = 0.005), with a shorter delay before being weaned of oxygen therapy (mean 11 vs. 16 days; p < 0.001). At D28, the rate of patients discharged from hospital was higher in the tocilizumab group (70% vs. 40%, wHR = 1.82 [1.22-2.75]; p = 0.003). The levels of CRP and fibrinogen post therapy (p < 0.001 for both variables) were significantly lower in the tocilizumab group (interaction test, mixed model). Rates of neutropenia (35% vs. 0%; p < 0.001) were higher in the tocilizumab group, yet rates of infections (22% vs. 38%, p = 0.089) including ventilator-acquired pneumonia (8% vs. 26%, p = 0.022) were higher in the control group. Conclusion(s): These data could be helpful for the design of future trials aiming to counter COVID-19-induced inflammation, especially before patients require admission to the intensive care unit.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Risk factors for outbreaks of COVID-19 in care homes following hospital discharge: A national cohort analysis. Background: The population of adult residential care homes has been shown to have high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Method(s): We examined 3115 hospital discharges to a national cohort of 1068 adult care homes and subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring between 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics, including size and type of provision. Result(s): A total of 330 homes experienced an outbreak, and 544 homes received a discharge over the study period. Exposure to hospital discharge was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.47, P =.29) after adjusting for care home characteristics. Care home size was the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison with homes of <10 residents were as follows: 3.40 (1.99, 5.80) for 10-24 residents; 8.25 (4.93, 13.81) for 25-49 residents; and 17.35 (9.65, 31.19) for 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison with periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion(s): Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Acute portal vein thrombosis secondary to COVID-19: a case report. Background: COVID-19 pneumonia exhibits several extra-pulmonary complications. Case presentation: A 23-year old, asthmatic male with coronavirus pneumonia developed with generalized, acute abdominal pain. Further evaluations revealed a mild ascites and portal vein thrombosis although the patient received proper anticoagulation therapy. Routine lab data regarding the secondary causes of portal vein thrombosis were normal. Conclusion(s): We speculated that the underlying cause of portal vein thrombosis in our case was coronaviruses. Therefore, clinicians should always consider thrombosis and other hypercoagulable diseases in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wanzhou, China. The effectiveness of control measures to contain coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wanzhou, China was assessed. Epidemiological data were analyzed for 183 confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from five generations of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 throughout the entire COVID-19 outbreak in Wanzhou. Approximately 67.2% and 32.8% of cases were symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission accounted for 75.9% of the total recorded transmission. The reproductive number was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-2.40) for G1-to-G2 transmission, decreasing to 0.31-0.39 in later generations, concomitant with implementation of rigorous control measures. Substantially higher infection risk was associated with contact within 5 d after the infectors had been infected, frequent contact and >=8 h of contact duration. The spread of COVID-19 was effectively controlled in Wanzhou by breaking the transmission chain through social distancing, extensive contact tracing, mass testing and strict quarantine of close contacts.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.	false
0	Diffusion Capacity Abnormalities for Carbon Monoxide in Patients with COVID-19 At Three-Month Follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pulmonary function and clinical symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors within 3 months after hospital discharge, and to identify risk factors associated with impaired lung function., METHODS AND MATERIAL: COVID-19 patients were prospectively followed up with pulmonary function tests and clinical characteristics for 3 months following discharge from a hospital in Wuhan, China between January and February 2020., RESULTS: 647 patients were included. 87 (13%) patients presented with weakness, 63 (10%) with palpitation and 56 (9%) with dyspnea. Prevalences of the three symptoms were markedly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (19% versus 10% for weakness, p=0.003; 14% versus 7% for palpitation, p=0.007; 12% versus 7% for dyspnea, p=0.014). Results of multivariable regression showed an increased odd in the ongoing symptoms among severe patients (OR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.6, p=0.026) or patients with longer hospital stay (OR: 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00-1.05, p=0.041). Pulmonary function test results were available for 81 patients, including 41 non-severe and 40 severe patients. In this subgroup, 44 (54%) patients manifested abnormal diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (68% severe versus 42% non-severe patients, p=0.019). Chest CT total severity score (TSS)>10.5 (OR: 10.4; 95%CI: 2.5-44.1; p=0.001) on admission and ARDS (OR: 4.6; 95%CI: 1.4-15.5; p=0.014) were significantly associated with impaired DLCO. Pulmonary interstitial damage may be associated with abnormal DLCO., CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function, particularly DLCO, declined in COVID-19 survivors. This decrease was associated with TSS of chest CT >10.5 and ARDS occurrence. Pulmonary interstitial damage might contribute to the imparied DLCO. Copyright ©ERS 2021.	false
0	The tele-transition of toxicity management in routine oncology care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. BACKGROUND: Telehealth modalities were introduced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to assure continuation of cancer care and maintain social distance., METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of our telehealth expansion programme. We adapted two existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) telemonitoring tools that register and (self-)manage toxicities to therapy, while screening for SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. Outpatients from a tertiary cancer centre were enrolled. The adapted PRO interface allowed for uniform registration of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and effective triage of patients at home where we also implemented systematic throat washings, when available., RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty patients registered to the telemonitoring systems from March 13 to May 15, 2020. Four prespecified SARS-CoV-2 alarms resulted in three patients with positive PCR testing. Other Covid-19 symptoms (fever 5x and cough 2x) led to pretreatment triage resulting in 1 seroconversion after initial negative testing. One of the 477 throat washings proved positive., CONCLUSIONS: The rapid adoption of an amended PRO (self-)registrations and toxicity management system was feasible and coordinated screening for Covid-19. Continued clinical cancer care was maintained, with significant decreased waiting time. The systemic screening with throat washings offered no real improvement.	false
0	Depressive Symptoms, Sleep Quality and Diet During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Epidemic in China: A Survey of Medical Students. The psychological condition of medical students may be influenced by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. This study investigated the prevalence and influencing factors of depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality and poor diet in students at Kunming Medical University during the early part of the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional study was used from a questionnaire survey in February 2020. Of a total of 1,026 study participants, the prevalence of depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, and poor diet was, respectively, 22.4, 33.2, and 17.4%. Male students and students with a low degree of focus on COVID-19 had a high risk of depressive symptoms. A high percentage of females and students in the fifth grade, as well as students with high levels of concern about the negative impact of COVID-19 on their education or employment, comprised those with poor sleep quality. Students in the fifth grade and students with high levels of concern about the negative impact of COVID-19 on their education or employment were more likely to report poor diet. This study suggests the importance of monitoring medical students' depressive state during the COVID-19 outbreak, and universities are encouraged to institute policies and programs to provide educational counseling and psychological support to help students to cope with these problems.

0	Favipiravir induced acute pancreatitis in a covid-19 patient. There are a number of gastrointestinal symptoms and complications of COVID-19. Asymptomatic increase in pancreatic enzymes and rarely symptomatic pancreatitis are observed in this disease. This article describes a 37-year-old male suffering from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 infection, who received tablet favipiravir for his management. His condition was improving, when he developed acute pancreatitis, diagnosed clinically, biochemically and also with help of abdominal ultrasound. When he developed this, all typical symptoms of COVID-19 were improved. As a result, role of favipiravir in the development of this pancreatitis was suspected.Copyright © 2021, Bangladesh Society of Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	Long term SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness among three immunocompromised patients: from prolonged viral shedding to SARS-CoV-2 superinfection. Guidelines for stopping COVID-19 patient isolation are mainly symptom-based, with isolation for 10 to 20 days depending on their condition. Here, we describe three deeply immunocompromised patients, each with different clinical evolutions. Asymptomatic carriage, symptom resolution, or superinfection with a second SARS-CoV-2 strain were observed, all leading to prolonged infectious viral shedding several months. We followed the patients epidemiological, clinical, serological data, infectiousness using viral culture and viral mutations accumulated over time. Understanding underlying mechanisms and frequency of prolonged infectiousness is crucial to adapt current guidelines and strengthen the use of systematic PCR testing before stopping isolation in immunocompromised populations.

0	Clinical case: inflammatory multisystem syndrome in minor infant with giant aneurisms of coronary and abdominal aorta. Three-month-old female infant, who was admitted for 40-degree fever of 10 days of evolution, in poor general irritability, with 5 days of diarrheal stools, was treated with antipyretic and antimicrobial with no improvement on the two recent days vomiting, irritability, rejection of the oral route, with a punctate rash, erythematosus, in the chest, upper limbs as well as dry cough, dehydration, for which reason he entered the pediatric acute respiratory care unit in isolation at the risk of infection by SARCOV-2 due to suspicion. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient had leukocytosis, anemia, decreased platelets and altered liver enzymes. During her hospitalization with fever of 40 degrees of difficult handling, systematic desaturation of 50-60%. in paraclinics with elevated Ferritin 569, low hemoglobin 5.7 g, platelets 70,000, elevation of dimer D: 2.3. Chest thorax with apical right infiltrate, light cardiomegaly. Heart echocardiogram without congenital anatomical malformations, light pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, and light tricuspid, LVEF 65% Simpson, TAPSE 12 mm, PSAP 25 mmHg, both right dilated coronaries with rosary image measuring 2.5 mm in origin and 5 x aneurysm 7 mm diameter. Left coronary artery with an 8-mm-diameter aneurysm. EKG sinus rhythm without data on ischemia or arrhythmia, Troponin I 0.001. Immunoglobulin was started at 2 g/kg/dose to pass in 24 to 36 h, aspirin 80 mg/kg/day, continued with antibiotic. Infant Febrile persists, 2 peaks of 38 and 39.2 C despite 72 h of antibiotic and immunoglobulin dose. It was decided to administer a second bolus of immunoglobulin at 2 g/kg/dose, continue ASA and clopidogrel, and Methylprednisolone bolus of 30 mg/kg for 3 days. Without improvement with persistent fever, a second dose of immunoglobulin was administered. With good response to the afebrile patient treatment, without data of respiratory distress, tolerates the oral route, is adequately fed. An angiotomography was performed, showing giant aneurysmal lesions in both coronaries, aneurysms in the left subclavian artery, mammary arteries, and a large aneurysm in the abdominal aorta. At discharge, the patient was on enoxaparin 5 mg every 12 h, aspirin 5 mg/kg/day, Clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg/day, prednisone, and weekly methotrexate. Conclusion(s): From the studies of Dr Yamasaki in Mexico in 2012 and 2018, it was established that in some patients they can develop toxic shock due to kawsaki disease, however, due to the presence of covid- 19, in children with negative pcr but with a positive or igg test for covid-19, develop a very aggressive presentation that can lead to involvement of large-caliber arteries such as the abdominal aorta. The genomic profile is pending.	false
0	Medical cold compress for medical device-related pressure injury during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the effect of medical cold compress on preventing medical device-related pressure injuries (MDRPIs) that cause pain and itching of medical staff in the contact area of the mask and skin during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Method(s): We enrolled 120 medical staffs in a hospital in the Wuhan epidemic-stricken area and randomly divided them into the observation group (used medical cold compress before wearing medical protective equipment) and the control group (didn't use medical cold compress before wearing medical protective equipment), with 60 cases in each group. The cumulative use time of medical personal protective equipment (PPE) within a day, the continuous use time of PPE, average scores of overall discomforts (respiratory resistance caused by PPE, itching and pain in the contact area of the mask, etc.), and the incidence of skin allergy and contact dermatitis were recorded and compared between the two groups. Result(s): The time of cumulative use of PPE in a day and the time of continuous use of PPE were both significantly longer in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.001). Furthermore, the observation group showed significant decrease in the average scores of overall discomforts including respiratory resistance, itching and pain (P<0.001), and the incidence of skin allergy and contact dermatitis than the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Medical cold compress can exert a protective effect on MDRPIs in first-line medical staff, and prolong the use time of medical PPE, which is of high value for clinical application.Copyright © 2021, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

0	Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Background: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in Hong Kong. We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. Method(s): We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Finding(s): Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. Interpretation(s): A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.	false
0	Characteristic of chronic plaque psoriasis patients treated with biologics in Italy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk analysis from the PSO-BIO-COVID observational study. Background: The susceptibility of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and the risks or benefits related to the use of biological therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Few data about prevalence, clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 among psoriatic patients were reported. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents during the first phase of the emergency (22 February to 22 April 2020) in Italy, and 2) to report the clinical outcomes of patients who have been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, aged >=18 years and undergoing treatment with biologic agents as of 22 February 2020, were eligible to be included in PSO-BIO-COVID study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients using any biologic for psoriasis treatment between 22 February and 22 April 2020 were registered. Result(s): A total of 12,807 psoriatic patients were included in the PSO-BIO-COVID study. In this cohort 26 patients (0.2%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eleven patients required hospitalization and two died. Conclusion(s): The incidence of COVID-19 observed in our cohort of psoriatic patients (0.2%) is similar to that seen in the general population (0.31%) in Italy. However, the course of the disease was mild in most patients. Biological therapies may likely lessen 'cytokine storm' of COVID-19, which sometimes lead to multiple organ failure, ARDS, and death.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	false
0	Prevalence and risk indicators of first-wave COVID-19 among oral health-care workers: A French epidemiological survey. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have highlighted the increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 for health-care workers and suggest that oral health-care workers may carry the greatest risk. Considering the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a similar increased risk can be hypothesized for other respiratory infections. However, no study has specifically assessed the risk of contracting COVID-19 within the dental profession., METHODS: An online survey was conducted within a population of French dental professionals between April 1 and April 29, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore risk indicators associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes (i.e. phenotypes present in 15% or more of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases)., RESULTS: 4172 dentists and 1868 dental assistants responded to the survey, representing approximately 10% of French oral health-care workers. The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was 1.9% for dentists and 0.8% for dental assistants. Higher prevalence was found for COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes both in dentists (15.0%) and dental assistants (11.8%). Chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with increased odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, whereas working in a practice limited to endodontics was associated with decreased odds. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of public transportation and having a practice limited to periodontology were associated with increased odds of presenting a COVID-19-related clinical phenotype. Moreover, changes in work rhythm or clinical practice were associated with decreased odds of both outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Although oral health-care professionals were surprisingly not at higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population, specific risk indicators could exist, notably among high aerosol-generating dental subspecialties such as periodontology. Considering the similarities between COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes other viral respiratory infections, lessons can be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the usefulness of equipping and protecting oral health-care workers, notably during seasonal viral outbreaks, to limit infection spread., IMPACT: Results from this study may provide important insights for relevant health authorities regarding the overall infection status of oral health-care workers in the current pandemic and draw attention to particular at-risk groups, as illustrated in the present study. Protecting oral health-care workers could be an interesting public health strategy to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or the emergence of new pandemics.	false
0	Viral Infection and Cardiovascular Disease: Implications for the Molecular Basis of COVID-19 Pathogenesis. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While this respiratory virus only causes mild symptoms in younger healthy individuals, elderly people and those with cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension are susceptible to developing severe conditions that can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of this virus on the cardiovascular system should thus help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since this virus causes severe and fatal conditions in older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities, effective therapies targeting specific populations will likely contribute to ending this pandemic. In this review article, the effects of various viruses-including other coronaviruses, influenza, dengue, and human immunodeficiency virus-on the cardiovascular system are described to help provide molecular mechanisms of pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The goal is to provide mechanistic information from the biology of other viral infections in relation to cardiovascular pathologies for the purpose of developing improved vaccines and therapeutic agents effective in preventing and/or treating the acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.	false
0	Smart technologies driven approaches to tackle COVID-19 pandemic: a review.

Besides this, the technological shift in mask and sensor technology during the pandemic have been illustrated, which includes fabrication method like 3D printing and optical sensing, respectively. Furthermore, the strength, weakness, opportunities, and possible threats that have been shaped by the rigorous implementation of these technologies are also covered in detail.Copyright © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.	false
0	Misinformation about covid-19 and confidential information leakage: Impacts on the psychological well-being of indians. Misinformation, in most cases, is the reconfigured content using basic tools. Fake information related to casualties, infections, contacts, lockdowns, investments, exam schedules, and immigration, leads to confusion, fears, phobophobia, discrimination, harassment, physical injuries, deaths, financial damages, reputational losses, and many more long-lasting side effects. Objective(s): The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the many ways in which misinformation and information leakage related to COVID-19 can influence the stakeholders, such that it gives policymakers and citizens a greater understanding of both direct and indirect risks and harms when assessing the challenges their countries are facing. Method(s): An extensive literature review was done on the prevalence of the COVID-19 related misinformation and its associated significant psychological, reputational, physical, and societal implications on Indians. The novel and possible approaches to fight against the misinformation are described.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.	false
0	Ibrutinib-induced acute kidney injury via interstitial nephritis. The introduction of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib has made a significant progress in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies. Due to the reduction of cytokine release, it is effective in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and its use has also been suggested in autoimmune diseases and in prevention of COVID-19-associated lung damage. Despite this effect on the immune response, we report a severe hypersensitivity reaction in a 76-year-old male patient diagnosed with prolymphocytic leukemia. Four weeks after the ibrutinib start, non-oliguric acute kidney injury with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria developed and that was accompanied by lower limb purpuras and paresthesia. Renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis. Employing 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone administration, serum creatinine decreased from 365 mumol/L to 125 mumol/L at 11 days and the proteinuria-hematuria as well as the purpura, paresthesia resolved. Three months later at stabile eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2 methylprednisolone was withdrawn and a rituximab-venetoclax treatment was initiated without side effects. We conclude that despite the beneficial effect on cytokines response in Th1 direction, ibrutinib can cause acute interstitial nephritis. Early detection, discontinuation of ibrutinib, glucocorticoid administration may help to better preserve renal function, thereby lowering the risk of potential subsequent kidney injury.	false
0	Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality. COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, is one of the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting therapeutic plasma with desired functionalities.	false
0	Vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective observational study. Vitamin D has been reported to have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties [1]. The aim of the study was to understand the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective, observational study. We included COVID-19-positive patients admitted to our hospital between 16 March and 31 May 2020 and had serum vitamin D level recorded. Deficiency was identified as serum level < 25 nmol.l-1. Electronic records were analysed to compare age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, APACHE 2 score and ventilation methods. Only patients requiring invasive ventilation were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Results Two hundred and thirty-nine patients were included, comprising 84 admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and 155 for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) on the ward. Fifty-nine patients had serum vitamin D level recorded; 36 were deficient. The two groups (vitamin D level < or <= 25 nmol.l-1) were comparable with regards to age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, chronic comorbidities and APACHE 2 scores (M (SD) 16.1 (6.2) vs. 15.3 (5.9) t35 = 0.355, p = 0.724). More vitamin D deficient patients needed invasive ventilation (27 (75%) ICU patients vs. 9 (25%) NIV patients X21 = 5.964, p = 0.015). Discussion The literature suggests a correlation between low vitamin D and increased severity of COVID-19 [1]. Based on our small sample, it seems that low vitamin D is associated with increased need for invasive ventilation. It is an interesting observation that although the two groups were comparable, including APACHE 2 scores (highest score on ward used), more vitamin D deficient patients required invasive ventilation. A protective effect of vitamin D on the alveolar epithelium over and above its anti-inflammatory effects is suggested as possible preventative factors for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2]. Although some authors have recommended vitamin D supplementation to prevent COVID-19 infection, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) do not recommend it to prevent or treat COVID-19; however, they recommend prescribing higher therapeutic doses of vitamin D for people with deficiency. In line with this, we are routinely measuring and if required, supplementing vitamin D to our ICU patients. We are collaborating with NHS Trusts in South West London to share data for pooled analysis, although a well-conducted randomised control trial to evaluate vitamin D supplementation on the course of critical illness is needed to provide definitive evidence.	false
0	Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-β (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patient’s plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB pathway, we examined the status of TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Importance</h4> Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.	false
0	COVID-19 pandemic and breast cancer management: A retrospective observational clinical study from Pakistan. Background: COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected care of breast cancer patients world-wide. There is paucity of available data on cancer management in lower-middle income countries during this pandemic, we sought to determine the institutional approach towards management of breast cancer patients and the outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at our institution., Materials and methods: Clinicopathological and treatment record of cancer patients who presented to the Breast Clinic from 15th March to 31st December 2020 was retrieved from the institutional database for this retrospective clinical observational study., Results: A total of 292 patients were qualified for the analysis in which 206 patients (70.5%) underwent breast cancer surgeries. Only 10 of them (4.9%) were identified to be COVID-19 virus positive on routine pre-operative RT-PCR test before elective surgeries. All were asymptomatic, received home-based care via telecommunication and were operated at a later date when test turned out negative. None of them developed any complications post-operatively. Another group of 86 patients (29.5%) were referred for Neoadjuvant/Systemic chemotherapy in which COVID-19 infection was detected in only 4 patients (4.6%) while receiving cycles. Two patients shown symptoms of cough and fever hence hospitalised but were not candidates for Intensive Care Unit admission while other two patient were asymptomatic and isolated at home. All patients recovered well and chemotherapy was commenced again after negative RT-PCR test. No mortality was observed., Conclusion: Despite of being a global crisis particularly for cancer patients we observed infectivity, complications and fatality much lower among breast cancer cases. Further research is needed in this regard including public and private sector hospitals for better understanding behavior of COVID-19 disease and achieve common goal to combat COVID-19 and cancer together.

0	Increased frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis at type 1 diabetes onset among children during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: an observational cohort study. INTRODUCTION: On March 11, 2020 the WHO announced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Lockdown restrictions, compromised access to medical care and fear of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have forced patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) to stay home. Thissituation can lead to delay in T1D diagnosis and insulin treatmentresultingin rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and therefore increased risk of complications and death.., AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of DKA at the onset of T1D in children diagnosed in our department during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 till May 2020 in comparison to corresponding period of the previous year.., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected data ofchildren with newly diagnosed T1D. DKA was defined according to ISPAD guidelines.., RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 34 childrenin group2020and 52 in group2019 with an average age 9.90 +/-4.9 vs. 9.59+/-4.7 years with mean HbA1c 12.9 +/-2.4vs.11.5 +/-2.2%,respectively. The incidence of DKA was higher by 12% ingroup2020 vs.2019 (52.94% vs 40.38%; p = 0.276).  Regarding the DKA severity (2020 vs. 2019)32.35% vs. 11.54% weresevere (p = 0.026), 17.65 vs. 13% were moderate (p = 0.759), and 2.94 vs. 15.38%weremild (p = 0.081). None of the analyzed patients were COVID-19 positive., CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changes in society and health care system, the DKA rate has increased by 12 percentage points with more severe cases noted in children with newly diagnosedT1D. Regular education of the whole society about the symptoms of diabetes could contribute to faster diagnosis of T1D and reduction of DKA prevalence..	false
0	Comparison of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Screening Using Reverse Transcriptase-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction or CRISPR-Based Assays in Asymptomatic College Students. Importance: The reopening of colleges and universities in the US during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant public health challenge. The development of accessible and practical approaches for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in the college population is paramount for deploying recurrent surveillance testing as an essential strategy for virus detection, containment, and mitigation., Objective: To determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic participants in a university community by using CREST (Cas13-based, rugged, equitable, scalable testing), a CRISPR-based test developed for accessible and large-scale viral screening., Design, Setting, and Participants: For this cohort study, a total of 1808 asymptomatic participants were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a CRISPR-based assay and a point-of-reference reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test. Viral prevalence in self-collected oropharyngeal swab samples collected from May 28 to June 11, 2020, and from June 23 to July 2, 2020, was evaluated., Exposures: Testing for SARS-CoV-2., Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 status, viral load, and demographic information of the study participants were collected., Results: Among the 1808 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.3 [11.0] years; 955 [52.8%] female), 732 underwent testing from May to early June (mean [SD] age, 28.4 [11.7] years; 392 [53.6%] female). All test results in this cohort were negative. In contrast, 1076 participants underwent testing from late June to early July (mean [SD] age, 26.6 [10.5] years; 563 [52.3%] female), with 9 positive results by RT-qPCR. Eight of these positive samples were detected by the CRISPR-based assay and confirmed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified diagnostic testing. The mean (SD) age of the positive cases was 21.7 (3.3) years; all 8 individuals self-identified as students. These metrics showed that a CRISPR-based assay was effective at capturing positive SARS-CoV-2 cases in this student population. Notably, the viral loads detected in these asymptomatic cases resemble those seen in clinical samples, highlighting the potential of covert viral transmission. The shift in viral prevalence coincided with the relaxation of stay-at-home measures., Conclusions and Relevance: These findings reveal a shift in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in a young and asymptomatic population and uncover the leading edge of a local outbreak that coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. The concordance between CRISPR-based and RT-qPCR testing suggests that CRISPR-based assays are reliable and offer alternative options for surveillance testing and detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as is required to resume operations in higher-education institutions in the US and abroad.	false
0	The temporary ban on tobacco sales in South Africa: lessons for endgame strategies. BACKGROUND: The endgame literature recommends that, for a tobacco sales ban to be successful, several demand-side preconditions (eg, low prevalence and effective cessation support) should be in place. The South African Government imposed a ban on the sale of all tobacco and vaping products between 27 March and 17 August 2020, as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess how cigarette smokers responded to the sales ban, to evaluate how the ban impacted the cigarette market in South Africa and to use the South African experience to inform endgame planning. METHOD(S): Regular preban cigarette smokers completed an online questionnaire from 4 to 19 June 2020 (n=23 631), in which they reported on their prelockdown cigarette smoking patterns, quitting behaviour (if relevant) and smoking behaviour during the ban. RESULT(S): About 9% of prelockdown smokers in the sample successfully quit smoking. 93% of continuing smokers purchased cigarettes despite the sales ban. The average price of cigarettes increased by 250% relative to prelockdown prices. Most respondents purchased cigarettes through informal channels. CONCLUSION(S): The demand-side preconditions for an effective sales ban were not in place in South Africa, making a sales ban inappropriate. The South African experience suggests that supply-side factors are also important in ensuring the success of a sales ban. These are: (1) the illicit market must be under control before implementing a sales ban; and (2) an effective sales ban needs to be synchronised with a ban on the manufacture, transport and distribution of cigarettes.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	[Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children]. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19. Most infected children have asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations. A few develop serious illness, and the case fatality rate is lower than in adults. The most frequent symptoms are fever and cough. Studies indicate that children might be less susceptible to infection than adults as summarised in this review. Despite mild manifestation, some children experience a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, similarly to Kawasaki disease. The syndrome is still very rare, and the pathogenesis remains unknown.	false
0	Second waves, social distancing, and the spread of COVID-19 across the USA. We recently described a dynamic causal model of a COVID-19 outbreak within a single region. Here, we combine several instantiations of this (epidemic) model to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity—and the exchange of people between regions—and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) firstly emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. After going through the experimental process, the virus was named the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020 which has created a global pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is challenging the people who are especially suffering from chronic health problems such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease or immune system deteriorating disorders, including cancers, Alzheimer's, etc. Other predisposing/risk factors consist of smoking and age (elderly people are at higher risk). The 2019-nCoV attacks epithelial cells in all organs, particularly epithelial cells in the lungs, resulting in viral pneumonia. The 2019-nCoV starts its invasion with the attachment and entry into the respiratory tract epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the epithelial cells. The critical problem with 2019-nCoV is its ability in human to the human asymptomatic transmission which causes the rapid and hidden spread of the virus among the population. Also, there are several reports of highly variable and tightly case-dependent clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV2, which made the virus more enigmatic. The clinical symptoms are varied from common manifestations which occurred in flu and cold, such as cough, fever, body-ache, trembling, and runny nose to severe conditions, like the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even uncommon/unusual symptoms such as anosmia, skin color change, and stroke. In fact, besides serious injuries in the respiratory system, COVID-19 invades and damages various organs, including the kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, and nervous system. Accordingly, to cut the transmission chain of disease and control the infection spread. One of the major solutions seems to be early detection of the carriers, particularly the asymptomatic people with the help of sensitive and accurate diagnostic techniques. Moreover, developing novel and appropriate therapeutic approaches will contribute to the suitable management of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to make comprehensive investigations and study reviews about COVID-19, offering the latest findings of novel therapies, drugs, epidemiology, and routes of virus transmission and pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss new therapeutic outcomes and cover and the most significant aspects of COVID-19, including the epidemiology, biological features, organs failure, and diagnostic techniques.

0	Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 can be unknown carriers magnifying the transmission of COVID-19. This study appraised the frequency of asymptomatic individuals and estimated occurrence by age group and gender by reviewing the existing published data on asymptomatic people with COVID-19. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS), were used to search the literature following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The study population for this review included asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in original articles published up to 30 April 2020. A random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases among all COVID-19 patients and also by age and gender. From the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the pooled prevalence according to the random effect size of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30-67%). Of the asymptomatic cases, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6-66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5-79.1%) were children. Children and females were more likely to present as asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and could act as unknown carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom-based screening might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections escalating the threat of global spread and impeding containment. Therefore, a mass surveillance system to track asymptomatic cases is critical, with special attention to females and children.

0	Pathophysiology of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider. BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global health problem. Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, incompletely understood deleterious and aberrant host immune responses play critical roles in severe disease. Our objective was to summarise the available information on the pathophysiology of COVID-19., METHODS: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the following PICO framework: P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; I (intervention): any intervention/no intervention; C (comparator): any comparator; O (outcome) any clinical or serological outcome including but not limited to immune cell phenotype and function and serum cytokine concentration., RESULTS: Of the 55 496 records yielded, 84 articles were eligible for inclusion according to question-specific research criteria. Proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), was increased, especially in severe COVID-19, although not as high as other states with severe systemic inflammation. The myeloid and lymphoid compartments were differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection depending on disease phenotype. Failure to maintain high interferon (IFN) levels was characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19 and could be related to loss-of-function mutations in the IFN pathway and/or the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a high variability across individuals and disease spectrum. Multiparametric algorithms showed variable diagnostic performances in predicting survival, hospitalisation, disease progression or severity, and mortality., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection affects both humoral and cellular immunity depending on both disease severity and individual parameters. This systematic literature review informed the EULAR 'points to consider' on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory therapies. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	COVID-19 related depression and anxiety among quarantined respondents. OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented threat to public health. Current measures to control the spread include social distancing and quarantine, which may trigger mental health problems. DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sample (N=1160) constituted three groups: people quarantined in an affected area, unaffected areas, and people not in quarantine. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-20) and the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) were administered as measures of depression and anxiety, respectively. The multi-variant logistic and multiple linear regression identified factors associated with depression and anxiety. RESULT(S): Probable depression and anxiety were reported by 26.47% and 70.78% of all respondents, respectively. After adjusting for demographic and community variables, quarantined respondents reported a higher likelihood to exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety than those not quarantined. Respondents living in communities where screening for COVID-19 was required were less likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): The incidence of depression and anxiety among quarantined respondents was significantly higher than that of respondents not quarantined, and twice as common among quarantined respondents in unaffected areas as those in affected areas. Appropriate community screening may reduce the risk of depression and anxiety during an epidemic.	false

0	COVID-19, food security and maternal mental health in Ceara, Brazil: a repeated cross-sectional survey. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the change in the risk of food insecurity and maternal mental disorder (MMD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between July 17 and September 10, 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental disorders. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020., SETTING: Ceara, Brazil., PARTICIPANTS: 577 mother-child pairs who completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age., RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15.5% higher (95% CI: (5.9 - 25.1), p-value < 0.001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared to November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40.2% higher during the pandemic (95% CI: 32.6 - 47.8, p-value < 0.001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of food insecurity and MMD in Ceara increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the need for policies and interventions to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child health, nutrition, and well-being in Brazil.	false
0	Perception of COVID-19 physical distancing effectiveness and contagiousness of asymptomatic individuals: A cross sectional survey of deaf and hard of hearing adults in U.S. BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of information about the coronavirus on the Internet. If the language used in the video message is not clear or understandable to deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people with a high school degree or less, the unclear message can create confusion and information gaps among DHH people during a health emergency., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between DHH people's perceived effectiveness of physical distancing and contagious level for an asymptomatic person., METHODS: A cross-sectional study on the perceptions of DHH people on COVID-19 (N=445). Items pertaining to COVID-19 knowledge were administered to US deaf adults from April 17, 2020, to May 1, 2020 via a bilingual ASL/English online survey platform., RESULTS: The sample consisted of 475 DHH adults aged 18 to 88 years old, with 74% identifying as White and 60% as female. About 88% of the sample felt they knew most or a lot about PD. This figure dropped to 72% for the effectiveness of PD in reducing the spread of coronavirus and 70% for the contagiousness of an infected person without symptoms. Education and PD effectiveness significantly predicted knowledge of asymptomatic individual. Race, gender, and age did not emerge as significant predictors., CONCLUSIONS: This study results point to the strong connection between education and coronavirus-related knowledge. Education-related disparity can be remedied by making information fully accessible and easily understood during emergencies and pandemics., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	COVID-19 in Autoinflammatory Diseases with Immunosuppressive Treatment. COVID-19 disease increases interleukin (IL)-1beta release. Anti-IL-1-treatment is effective in IL-1-mediated autoinflammatory diseases (AID). This case series presents COVID-19 in patients with IL-1-mediated and unclassified AID with immunosuppressive therapy (IT). Patient 1 is a 34-year-old woman with an unclassified AID and methotrexate. Patients 2 and 3 (14-year-old girl and 12-year-old boy, respectively) have a Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (NLRP3 p.Q703K heterozygous, CAPS) treated with canakinumab 150 mg/month since three and five years, respectively. Patient 4 is a 15-year-old girl who has had familial Mediterranean fever (MEFV p. M694V homozygous) for 3 years treated with canakinumab 150 mg/month and colchicine. All patients had a mild acute COVID-19 course, particularly the adolescent patients. A few weeks after COVID-19 recovery, both CAPS patients developed increased AID activity, necessitating anti-IL-1-treatment intensification in one patient. At day 100, one out of four patients (25%) showed positive antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. This is one of the first reports providing follow-up data about COVID-19 in AID. The risk for severe acute COVID-19 disease was mild/moderate, but increased AID activity post-COVID-19 was detected. Follow-up data and data combination are needed to expand understanding of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 immunity in AID and the role of IT.	false
0	Cardiovascular sequalae in uncomplicated COVID-19 survivors. BACKGROUND: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients were reported to have cardiac involvements. Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance., METHODS: We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID-19 survivors including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, serum troponin and NT-proBNP assay 1-4 weeks after hospital discharge. Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed according to initial screening results., RESULTS: The mean age was 46.5 +/- 18.6 years; 53.6% were men. All were classified with non-severe disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care. Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 42.3% including sinus bradycardia (29.9%), newly detected T-wave abnormality (8.2%), elevated troponin level (6.2%), newly detected atrial fibrillation (1.0%), and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NT-proBNP level (1.0%). Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 7.2% COVID-19 survivors, which appeared to be self-limiting and recovered over time. For COVID-19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction., CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVID-survivors with mild disease, which is mostly self-limiting. Nonetheless, cardiac surveillance in form of ECG and/or serum biomarkers may be advisable to detect more severe cardiac involvement including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction.	false
0	Psychiatric challenges of COVID-19. Study Group Summary: In this international study group speakers from different countries will present different ways in which they have been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The unique data will include: Dr. Lewis from New York, the epicenter of Covid-19 in the U.S., will discuss racial disparities of COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on psychiatric patients in hospitals and community settings. Dr. Lewis will discuss (1) fundamental underlying systemand individual-level causes of disparities, (2) initial responses to these disparities by the NYS Office of Mental Health, and (3) salient opportunities to develop innovative strategies for service delivery that prioritize prevention of disparities related to Covid-19, and future pandemics. Dr. Bradley will discuss innovations in consultation-liaison psychiatry developed during the COVID-19 outbreak to improve psychiatric care for these patients while medically hospitalized, including interventions to proactively identify and manage psychological distress, reduce patient isolation, and prevent psychiatric emergencies that may lead to breaches of infection control. Challenges in converting to a largely telephonic and video inpatient service will be described. Dr. Arango from Spain, the country with the largest number of infected health staff, will describe the programs put in place to take care of health professionals by the Liason Department of Psychiatry. The hospital staff has been overwhelmed by the combination of fear, guilt, knowledge that they are not saving lives that they know could be saved under different circumstances, frustration at not having a proper treatment and at not being able to predict who is going to do poorly, working in a different place and with different populations that they are used to, among many other stressful factors. He will present data on psychopathology detected in the health staff (including suicidal ideation/attempts) and results from interventions conducted with them (ventilation groups and individual counseling). Dr. Li from Shanghai will describe his experiences in China during the pandemic, including a systematic review of the prevalence of mental problems in COVID-19 positive patients, the clinical organization of psychiatric wards and outpatient clinics, and psychological intervention for COVID-19 positive patients. Dr. Weiser from Israel will discuss the establishment of a locked psychiatric ward located within a general hospital which treated acute psychiatric patients infected with COVID-19 from the entire country. Modifications included 2-way tele-monitors enabling remote communication between patients and staff, oxygen delivery capabilities, clothing protective both against infection with COVID-19 and also tear-proof. We admitted 17 patients during one month, all involuntary, used high doses of antipsychotics and restraints in order to minimize presence of staff in the corona infected ward. There were significant problems with false positive and false negative PCR testing. These presentations will be clinically useful for psychiatrists currently organizing services and treating COVID-19 patients, and will also be relevant for preparing for future epidemics and natural disasters.	false
0	"Middle Ear Viral Load Considerations in the COVID-19 Era: A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the available medical literature to investigate the viral load in the middle ear and mastoid cavity and the potential risk of exposure to airborne viruses during otologic surgery. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases. STUDY SELECTION: This review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Protocol. DATA EXTRACTION: Using the Boolean method and relevant search term combinations for terms ""mastoid,"" ""middle ear,"" ""virus,"" ""exposure"" ""COVID-19"" ""SARS-CoV-2."" PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were queried. A total of 57 abstracts were identified and screened by two independent reviewers. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 studies were selected for the final analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the heterogeneity of clinical data, a meta-analysis was not feasible. RESULT(S): Rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus are reported to be the most prevalent viruses in MEF samples but formal statistical analysis is precluded by the heterogeneity of the studies. Drilling was identified to have the highest risk for aerosol generation and therefore viral exposure during otologic Surgery. CONCLUSION(S): The medical literature has consistently demonstrated the presence of nucleic acids of respiratory viruses involving the middle ear, including SARS-CoV2 in a recent postmortem study. Although no in vivo studies have been conducted, due to the likely risk of transmission, middle ear and mastoid procedures, particularly involving the use of a drill should be deferred, if possible, during the pandemic and enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) used if surgery is necessary.Copyright © 2020, Otology & Neurotology, Inc."	false
0	Potential SARS-CoV-2 Immune Correlates of Protection in Infection and Vaccine Immunization. Both SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccines induce robust immune responses. Current data suggested that high neutralizing antibody titers with sustained Th1 responses might correlate with protection against viral transmission and disease development and severity. In addition, genetic and innate immune factors, including higher levels of type I interferons, as well as the induction of trained immunity and local mucosal immunity also contribute to lower risk of infection and amelioration of disease severity. The identification of immune correlates of protection will facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics strategies.	false
0	Effective virus-neutralizing activities in antisera from the first wave of severe COVID-19 survivors. The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become one of the worst public health crises. However, knowledge about the dynamics of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients is still poorly understood. In this study, we performed serological study with serum specimens collected at the acute and the convalescent phases from 104 severe COVID-19 patients who were the first wave of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China. Our findings uncovered that neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are persistent at least for more than 6 months in severe COVID-19 patients, despite that immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels against receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) IgG declined from the acute to the convalescent phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that the level of RBD-IgG is capable of correlating with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activities in COVID-19 serum. In summary, our findings identify the magnitude, functionality and longevity of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, which sheds light on better understanding of humoral immune response to COVID-19, and would be beneficial for developing vaccines.	false
0	Dietary Fish, Fish Nutrients, and Immune Function: A Review. Dietary habits have a major impact on the development and function of the immune system. This impact is mediated both by the intrinsic nutritional and biochemical qualities of the diet, and by its influence on the intestinal microbiota. Fish as a food is rich in compounds with immunoregulatory properties, among them omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, tryptophan, taurine and polyamines. In addition, regular fish consumption favors the proliferation of beneficial members of the intestinal microbiota, like short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. By substituting arachidonic acid in the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish change the type of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes being produced, resulting in anti-inflammatory properties. Further, they also are substrates for the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (resolvins, protectins, and maresins), lipid compounds that constitute the physiological feedback signal to stop inflammation and give way to tissue reparation. Evidence from human observational and interventional studies shows that regular fish consumption is associated with reduced incidence of chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and that continuous infusion of fish oil to tube-fed, critically ill patients may improve important outcomes in the ICU. There is also evidence from animal models showing that larger systemic concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids may counter the pathophysiological cascade that leads to psoriasis. The knowledge gained over the last few decades merits future exploration of the potential role of fish and its components in other conditions characterized by deregulated activation of immune cells and a cytokine storm like viral sepsis or COVID-19.

0	Conjugation of Mannans to Enhance the Potency of Liposome Nanoparticles for the Delivery of RNA Vaccines. Recent approval of mRNA vaccines to combat COVID-19 have highlighted the potential of this platform. Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is the delivery vehicle of choice for mRNA as they prevent its enzymatic degradation by encapsulation. We have recently shown that surface exposition of mannose, incorporated in LNPs as stable cholesterol-amine conjugate, enhances the potency of self-amplifying RNA (SAM) replicon vaccines through augmented uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Here, we generated a new set of LNPs whose surface was modified with mannans of different length (from mono to tetrasaccharide), in order to study the effect on antibody response of model SAM replicon encoding for the respiratory syncytial virus fusion F protein. Furthermore, the impact of the mannosylated liposomal delivery through intradermal as well as intramuscular routes was investigated. The vaccine priming response showed to improve consistently with increase in the chain length of mannoses; however, the booster dose response plateaued above the length of disaccharide. An increase in levels of IgG1 and IgG2a was observed for mannnosylated lipid nanoparticles (MLNPs) as compared to LNPs. This work confirms the potential of mannosylated SAM LNPs for both intramuscular and intradermal delivery, and highlights a disaccharide length as sufficient to ensure improved immunogenicity compared to the un-glycosylated delivery system.	false
0	An inverse stage-shift model to estimate the excess mortality and health economic impact of delayed access to cancer services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. AIM: Decreased cancer incidence and reported changes to clinical management indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to develop and apply a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation., METHODS: A model was developed and made publicly available to estimate population-level health economic outcomes by extrapolating and weighing stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation. It was applied to estimate the impact of 3- and 6-month delays based on Australian data for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma. Two approaches were explored to estimate stage shifts following a delay: (a) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal, and lung cancer), and (b) based on the tumor growth rate (melanoma)., RESULTS: Using a conservative once-off 3-month delay and considering only shifts from stage I/T1 to stage II/T2, 88 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs were predicted in Australia over 5 years for all patients diagnosed in 2020. For a 6-month delay, excess mortality and healthcare costs were 349 deaths and $46 million over 5 years., CONCLUSIONS: The health and economic impacts of delays in treatment initiation cause an imminent policy concern. More accurate individual patient data on shifts in stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical for further analyses. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.	false
0	Ventilation and air cleaning to limit aerosol particle concentrations in a gym during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 can spread by close contact through large droplet spray and indirect contact via contaminated objects. There is mounting evidence that it can also be transmitted by inhalation of infected saliva aerosol particles. These particles are generated when breathing, talking, laughing, coughing or sneezing. It can be assumed that aerosol particle concentrations should be kept low in order to minimize the potential risk of airborne virus transmission. This paper presents measurements of aerosol particle concentrations in a gym, where saliva aerosol production is pronounced. 35 test persons performed physical exercise and aerosol particle concentrations, CO2 concentrations, air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the room of 886 m3. A separate test was used to discriminate between human endogenous and exogenous aerosol particles. Aerosol particle removal by mechanical ventilation and mobile air cleaning units was measured. The gym test showed that ventilation with air-change rate ACH = 2.2 h-1, i.e. 4.5 times the minimum of the Dutch Building Code, was insufficient to stop the significant aerosol concentration rise over 30 min. Air cleaning alone with ACH = 1.39 h-1 had a similar effect as ventilation alone. Simplified mathematical models were engaged to provide further insight into ventilation, air cleaning and deposition. It was shown that combining the above-mentioned ventilation and air cleaning can reduce aerosol particle concentrations with 80 to 90% , depending on aerosol size. This combination of existing ventilation supplemented with air cleaning is energy efficient and can also be applied for other indoor environments. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Stability analysis and optimal control of Covid-19 pandemic SEIQR fractional mathematical model with harmonic mean type incidence rate and treatment. In the present work, we investigated the transmission dynamics of fractional order SARS-CoV-2 mathematical model with the help of Susceptible S ( t ) , Exposed E ( t ) , Infected I ( t ) , Quarantine Q ( t ) , and Recovered R ( t ) . The aims of this work is to investigate the stability and optimal control of the concerned mathematical model for both local and global stability by third additive compound matrix approach and we also obtained threshold value by the next generation approach. The author's visualized the desired results graphically. We also control each of the population of underlying model with control variables by optimal control strategies with Pontryagin's maximum Principle and obtained the desired numerical results by using the homotopy perturbation method. The proposed model is locally asymptotically unstable, while stable globally asymptotically on endemic equilibrium. We also explored the results graphically in numerical section for better understanding of transmission dynamics. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Estimation of the fraction of COVID-19 infected people in U.S. states and countries worldwide. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial undocumented infections have obscured the true size of the currently infected population, which is arguably the most critical number for public health policy decisions. We developed a machine learning framework to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in all 50 U.S. states and the 50 most infected countries from reported test results and deaths. Using published epidemiological parameters, our algorithm optimized slowly varying daily ascertainment rates and a time course of currently infected cases each day. Severe under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases was found to be universal across U.S. states and countries worldwide. In 25 out of the 50 countries, actual cumulative cases were estimated to be 5-20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Our estimates of cumulative incidence were in line with the existing seroprevalence rates in 46 U.S. states. Our framework projected for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. that ~10% of the population has been infected once. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population was estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York this fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.	false
0	Prophylaxis for COVID-19: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: While the landscape of vaccine and treatment candidates against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reviewed systematically, prophylactic candidates remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE(S): Map pre- and post-exposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and MedRxiv. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: All studies in humans or animals and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations. INTERVENTIONS: PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19. METHOD(S): Systematic review (SR) and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of MedRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCTs outcomes since SR search completion. RESULT(S): We identified 13 studies (out of 2,119 database records) and 117 RCTs (out of 5565 RCTs in the registries) meeting inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n=2) or reported on animal studies (n=7) most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, anti(retro)virals, or use of vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSION(S): The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work, there is little evidence regarding other compounds with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.Copyright © 2021.

0	Elevated mucosal antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 are correlated with lower viral load and faster decrease in systemic COVID-19 symptoms. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Mucosal antibodies play a key role in protection against SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but their role during primary infection is not well understood. We assessed mucosal antibody responses during primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 and examined their relationship with viral load and clinical symptoms. Elevated mucosal IgM was associated with lower viral load. RBD and viral spike protein-specific mucosal antibodies were correlated with decreases in systemic symptoms, while older age was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms. Up to 42% of household contacts developed SARS-CoV-2-specific mucosal antibodies, including children, indicating high transmission rates within households in which children might play an important role.	false
0	Acute transverse myelitis of childhood due to novel coronavirus disease 2019: The first pediatric case report and review of literature. The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic appears to have some streaks of severity in pediatrics. These streaks include variable signs of respiratory distress, a new entity called multi-system inflammatory syndrome, and some evidences of neurological symptoms involving both central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we described the first pediatric patient with COVID-19 who presented with acute transverse myelitis. An 11-year-old otherwise healthy girl presented to our clinic with acute onset of lower limbs paresis, urinary and fecal retention, alongside epigastric pain, and fever for 3 days. A neurological examination revealed a severe flaccid paraplegia in her lower limbs associated with a sensory level at T5. She was evaluated systematically for all probable causes of her symptoms, and finally, due to having a positive nasopharyngeal PCR test, she was considered to suffer from post-COVID-19 transverse myelitis. She underwent intravenous-immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone pulse, and other supportive cares without obvious results. Therefore, she underwent seven sessions of plasma exchange with little effects on muscle strength. The focal inflammation and injury of the spinal cord, otherwise known as transverse myelitis, have a wide array of potential etiologies. Transverse myelitis has been well documented to be the result of viral and bacterial infections. We believe our patient was not involved in a cytokine storm status due to good CRP, IL-6 and Ferritin levels. Albeit, we cannot certainly consider the patient to have a direct viral impactor involved in a late immunity process. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TM in the field of pediatrics occurred after COVID-19. Thus, this is critical to note that children can present with some severe types of COVID-19.	false
0	The impact of COVID-19 on statewide EMS use for cardiac emergencies and stroke in Massachusetts. Objective: To evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emergency medical services (EMS) use for time-sensitive medical conditions. We examined EMS use for cardiac arrest, stroke, and other cardiac emergencies across Massachusetts during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating their relationship to statewide COVID-19 incidence and a statewide emergency declaration., Methods: A retrospective analysis of all EMS calls between February 15 and May 15, 2020 and the same time period for 2019. EMS call volumes were compared before and after March 10, the date of a statewide emergency declaration., Results: A total of 408,758 calls were analyzed, of which 49,405 (12.1%) represented stroke, cardiac arrest, or other cardiac emergencies. Average call volume before March 10 was similar in both years but decreased significantly after March 10, 2020 by 18.7% (P < 0.001). Compared to 2019, there were 35.6% fewer calls for cardiac emergencies after March 10, 2020 (153.6 vs 238.4 calls/day, P < 0.001) and 12.3% fewer calls for stroke (40.0 vs 45.6 calls/day, P = 0.04). Calls for cardiac arrest increased 18.2% (28.6 vs 24.2 calls/day, P < 0.001). Calls for respiratory concerns also increased (208.8 vs 199.7 calls/day, P < 0.001). There was no significant association between statewide incidence of COVID-19 and EMS call volume., Conclusions: EMS use for certain time-sensitive conditions decreased after a statewide emergency declaration, irrespective of actual COVID-19 incidence, suggesting the decrease was related to perception instead of actual case counts. These findings have implications for public health messaging. Measures must be taken to clearly inform the public that immediate emergency care for time-sensitive conditions remains imperative.

0	Descriprive Study of hemocultives in patients admitted to the ICU COVID-19 from march to may 2020. Introduction: Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and other infections have beenfrequent in patients admitted in ICU for Covid-19. However, many cultures collected withsuspected infectionhave been negative or contaminated. Objective(s): We aim to analyze the microbiological isolates from blood cultures in patients admitted for Covid-19 and Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in our Unit during the months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Method(s): Retrospective, descriptive, observational study of the microbiological isolates in blood cultures and catheter tips in patients admitted for Covid-19 from March to May 2020 in the ICU of a thirdlevel hospital. The data we used was obtained from the ENVIN-HELICS registry. The following were analyzed: demographic data, number of blood cultures extracted, number of positive blood cultures, percentage of Gram positive, Gram negative and fungal organisms, number and incidence density of CRBSI, hospital mortality and ICU mortality. Result(s): 60 patients were included, 48 (80%) were men and 12 women (20%), median APACHE II score 14.1 points, median age 60.47 years. Some blood culture was extracted from 51 patients (90%), 31 of them (53.4%) had the blood culture positive. In total, 163 blood cultures were performed: 73 were positive (45%) and 90 negative (55%). Of the positive results, 80% correspond to Gram positive microorganisms, 9% to Gram negative and 9% to fungi. The most frequent microorganism was coagulase-negative Staphilococcus (34%). 69 catheter tips were removed. In 21 (30.4%) microorganisms were isolated: gram positive 60%, gram negative 17% and fungi 23%. The remaining 69.6% were negative. There were 12 CRBSI in a total of 1285 days of central venous catheter (9.34 bacteremia/1000 days of central venous catheter). Utilization ratio = 1.02. ICU mortality was 33% and hospital mortality 38.98%. Conclusion(s): Our study reported a high number of blood cultures sent and catheters removed with suspected infection. Although most blood cultures were negative, there is a high rate of Gram-positive isolated and catheter-related infections, probably due to the high number of devices used and the severity of the disease. Despite these data, mortality in our ICU is similar to that described in the literature. This study makes us think that in an unknown Scenario and with exceptional protection measures, we cannot forget 'zero projects' as a measure to lower infection rates and to establish improvement points in ICUs.	false
0	Anakinra treatment in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Introduction: The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and viral sepsis leading to organ dysfunction and high mortality (1). A subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a hyperinflammatory state. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. Recently, small studies suggest that anakinra improve respiratory function and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients (2-4). Objective(s): We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation. Method(s): In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of 39 critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of several circulating cytokines were aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. Analysis were performed from day-10 to +10 relative to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed in propensity score matched groups. Result(s): Patient characteristics and clinical parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. Due to bias by indication, plasma levels of ASAT (p = 0.0002), ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no differences in the kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decrease of temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0 003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007) was more pronounced in the anakinra group (Fig. 1 a-f respectively). No differences in clinical outcomes were observed between groups. The propensity-matched analysis confirmed these results. Conclusion(s): Anakinra is effective in treating clinical signs of hyperinflammation that may promote organ dysfunction in critically ill COVID-19 patients.	false
0	High central venous pressure and high ventilatory pressures are associated with acute kidney injury in COVID19 critically ill patients. Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequent complication for COVID-19 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is independently associated with higher mortality. The patophysiology of COVID-19 related AKI is supposed to be multifactorial: haemodynamic alteration due to high levels of PEEP may play a role. Objective(s): We investigate if higher central venous pressure (CVP) and higher positive end expiratory pressure (Peep) were associated to higher incidence of AKI and if AKI was related to 28 days mortality. Method(s): 130 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Bergamo General Hospital for acute respiratory failure from 22th February to 22th March were enrolled. AKI was defined by KDIGO criteria. Age, sex and SOFA score were collected at ICU admission. Mean values of PVC and Peep during the first 14 days in ICU were compared between AKI group and controls, using Mann Whitney test. The association between AKI and mortality was evaluated with Fisher exact test. Result(s): In our population median age was 62 (IQR 14), 107 (82%) were male and median SOFA score was 6 (range 4-8). 74 (57%) patients developed AKI; 17 (13%) in stage 1, 16 (12%) in stage 2, and 41 (31%) in stage 3; 22 patients (17%) required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 28 days mortality among AKI group was significantly higher (46% vs 18% p-value 0.0008). Furthermore mean values of PVC and Peep were higher in AKI group compared to controls; relevant data are represented in the Table 1. Data are presented as median and interquartile range. Two groups are compared using Mann Whitney test for continuous variables and using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables Conclusion(s): Our data confirm that AKI represent a risk factor for mortality in COVID patients (odds ratio 3.9, 95% IC 1.8-8.8). Both higher PEEP and PVC are significantly associated with AKI, suggesting that the haemodynamic impact of high intrathoracic pressure may be involved in its pathogenesis.	false
0	Shorter telomere lengths in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The incidence of severe manifestations of COVID-19 increases with age with older patients showing the highest mortality, suggesting that molecular pathways underlying aging contribute to the severity of COVID-19. One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.	false
0	Evaluating 10 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests by use of the STARD (standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies) method. Numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapid serological tests have been developed, but their accuracy has usually been assessed using very few samples, and rigorous comparisons between these tests are scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) methodology. Two hundred fifty serum samples from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected 0 to 32 days after the onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests. Control serum samples (n = 254) were retrieved from pre-coronavirus disease (COVID) periods from patients with other coronavirus infections (n = 11), positivity for rheumatoid factors (n = 3), IgG/IgM hyperglobulinemia (n = 9), malaria (n = 5), or no documented viral infection (n = 226). All samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) from 10 manufacturers. Only four tests achieved $98% specificity, with the specificities ranging from 75.7% to 99.2%. The sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection after the onset of symptoms, from 31.7% to 55.4% (days 0 to 9), 65.9% to 92.9% (days 10 to 14), and 81.0% to 95.2% (.14 days). Only three of the tests evaluated met French health authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests ($90% sensitivity and $98% specificity). Overall, the performances varied greatly between tests, with only one-third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds. Knowledge of the analytical performances of these tests will allow clinicians and, most importantly, laboratorians to use them with more confidence; could help determine the general population's immunological status; and may help diagnose some patients with false-negative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in oral fluid obtained using a rapid collection device. Current commercially available methods for reliably detecting antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain expensive and inaccessible due to the need for whole-blood collection by highly trained phlebotomists using personal protective equipment (PPE). We have evaluated an antibody detection approach using the OraSure Technologies oral antibody collection device (OACD) and their proprietary SARS-CoV-2 total antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the OraSure test for total antibody detection in oral fluid had comparable sensitivity and specificity to commercially available serum-based ELISAs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection while allowing for a more accessible form of specimen collection with the potential for self-collection.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	COVID-19 Pandemic and Infertility: Gynecological Dilemma from an Indian Perspective. As the emaciated healthcare system is attempting to break the tide of the novel coronavirus pandemic across the globe, the highest cost of this fight is being borne by the third world countries. India is currently experiencing the peak incidence of COVID-19 cases. For the last 9 months, non-emergency services including OPDs have been suspended in majority of the hospitals to divert resources for combatting emergency medical care during this deadly pandemic. This temporary pause and containment could be detrimental to even patients suffering from malignancy. During this critical hour, commencement of infertility treatments including assisted reproductive technologies (ART) will add to additional burden upon the crippled medical fraternity. Fate of thousands of patients seems to hang by a fine thread now. In the resource-poor countries, it is our duty to divert maximum medical power to curtail this contagious pandemic rather than focusing on non-urgent treatment services.	false

0	Covid-19 outcomes among patients with multiple sclerosis: Experience from RWJBH multiple sclerosis comprehensive care center. Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) used to treat Multiple Sclerosis (MS) act primarily by altering the immune system. While many DMTs have well understood mechanisms of action, the consequences of immunomodulation in the setting of exposure to a novel viral pathogen were largely unknown until recently. Objective(s): Analyze clinical outcomes and risk of treatment with DMTs among patients with MS and related disorders who contracted COVID-19. Method(s): From March 10to July 1st, 2020, patients with MS and related disorders at RWJBH MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCCC) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified. The diagnosis was established through the nurse triage telephone line, telehealth visits with physicians, and review of medical records with subsequent clinical follow up. Result(s): We identified 25 patients (13 with relapsing MS; 11 with progressive MS; and 1 with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)) with laboratory-confirmed COVID19, either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing for SARSCoV- 2 antibodies. Of the entire cohort, 23 (92%) were on DMTs, with the majority on either anti-CD20 monoclonal therapies 10/25 (40%) or dimethyl fumarate 7/25 (28%). A total of 21 (84%) are fully recovered or recovering; 1 (4%) never developed symptoms; 8 (32%) required hospitalization; and 3 (12%) are deceased. Among those hospitalized, 5/8 (62.5%) were on anti-CD20 therapies. While the majority of our sample of MS patients had relapsing MS 13/24 (54.2%), the majority of hospitalized patients had progressive MS 5/8 (62.5.8%). Among the cohort, 9/25 (36%) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 8/9 (88.9%) had detectable antibodies while 1/9 (11.1%) did not, likely as a consequence of peripheral B lymphocyte depletion. Conclusion(s): Although nearly all patients at our MS center who contracted COVID-19 were on DMTs, most did not require hospitalization. According to June 2020 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 14% of patients with COVID-19 in the US required hospitalization, and 5% died. While the proportion of patients on DMT requiring hospitalization was higher than that reported for the general population, the mortality rate was similar.	false
0	A Prospective Cohort of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Health Care Workers: Clinical Characteristics, Outcomes, and Follow-up Strategy. Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of infection. Strategies to reduce in-hospital transmission between HCWs and to safely manage infected HCWs are lacking. Our aim was to describe an active strategy for the management of COVID-19 in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected HCWs and investigate its outcomes., Methods: A prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers in a tertiary teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain, was performed. An active strategy of weekly polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 was established by the Occupational Health department. Every positive HCW was admitted to the Hospital at Home Unit with daily assessment online and in-person discretionary visits. Clinical and epidemiological data were recorded., Results: Of the 590 HCWs included in the cohort, 134 (22%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15% (89 patients) remained asymptomatic during follow-up. A third of positive cases were detected during routine screening. The most frequent symptoms were cough (68%), hyposmia/anosmia (49%), and fever (41%). Ten percent of the patients required specific treatment at home, while only 4% of the patients developed pneumonia. Seventeen patients required a visit to the outpatient clinic for further evaluation, and 6 of these (1%) required hospital admission. None of the HCWs included in this cohort required intensive care unit admission or died., Conclusions: Active screening for SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs for early diagnosis and stopping in-hospital transmission chains proved efficacious in our institution, particularly due to the high percentage of asymptomatic HCWs. Follow-up of HCWs in Hospital at Home units is safe and effective, with low rates of severe infection and readmission. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio for predicting prognosis of severe COVID-19. ABSTRACT: To develop a useful score for predicting the prognosis of severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We retrospectively analyzed patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted from February 10, 2020 to April 5, 2020. First, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort. By univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis. Subsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort.A total of 145 patients were enrolled. In the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors. Among the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score >=2 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674-31.487, P < .001). Lastly, we confirmed that LLR was also an independent risk factor for prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients in the validation cohort where the AUC was 0.857 (95% CI: 0.718-0.997). LLR is an accurate predictive score for poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.	false
0	Perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Siberia and the Russian Far East. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women in the Far Eastern and Siberian Federal Districts of Russian Federation over 10 months of a pandemic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was secondary analysis of Public Data basis on 25 Dec 2020. Statistics included descriptive statistics, analysis of contingency tables, which assessed the value of chi 2, the achieved significance level (p)., RESULTS: During the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 8485 cases of COVID-19 were registered in pregnant women in the Far Eastern Federal District and the Siberian Federal District, accounting for 5.9% of registered pregnant women and 1.71% of the total affected population. The morbidity rate in pregnant women was 3.02 times higher than in the general population: 5933.2 vs 1960.8 per 100 thousand population. 27.4% of mothers had asymptomatic disease; 52.7% - mild; 16.6% - moderate, 2.5% - severe, 0.5% - critical disease. The incidence of hospitalization in ICU of pregnant women was higher relative to the general population (3.57% vs 2.24%, p < .001), but the frequency of mechanical ventilation was lower (0.48% vs 1.05%, p < .001). Preterm delivery had 18.3% (p < .001 CS - 42.0%. The mortality rate in pregnant women was 0.14% vs 1.95% - in the general population (p < .001). Perinatal mortality was 37 cases (1.56%), of which there were 31 stillbirths (1.26%), and 6 (0.25%) cases of early neonatal mortality. 148 (6.2%) COVID-19(+) newborns were identified, despite anti-epidemic measures., CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Siberia and the Far East is higher than in the general population, but the disease is characterized by a milder. Women with COVID-19 have a high rate of preterm birth and CS. 148 (6.2%) newborns isolated COVID-19.	false
0	Performance evaluation of antibody-based point-of-care devices intended for the identification of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. The novel coronavirus outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The local outbreak quickly rose to pandemic level that has spread to more than 188 countries with more than 19 million cases and 732,467 deaths worldwide. The current recommendation for testing is RT-PCR based tests of nasopharyngeal or alternatively nasal- and/or oropharyngeal swabs that detects infection with SARS-CoV-2 to diagnose acute infection. However, there is an urgent need for a quick and accurate antibody-based point-of-care test method to quickly identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who might be missed through active case finding and surveillance efforts. Serology tests measure the presence of antibodies in serum after infection. Here we compared the performance characteristics of 6 commercially available antibody-based point-of-care devices and their potential for identification of individuals infected at some time by SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Optimize the management of urological tube-related emergencies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Background: To introduce and determine the value of optimized strategies for the management of urological tube-related emergencies with increased incidence, complexity and operational risk during the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., Methods: All emergent urological patients at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, during the period of January 23 (the beginning of lockdown in Wuhan) to March 23, 2020, and the corresponding period in 2019 were recruited to form this study's COVID-19 group and control group, respectively. Tongji Hospital has the most concentrated and strongest Chinese medical teams to treat the largest number of severe COVID-19 patients. Patients in the control group were routinely treated, while patients in the COVID-19 group were managed following the optimized principles and strategies. The case incidence for each type of tube-related emergency was recorded. Baseline characteristics and management outcomes (surgery time, secondary complex operation rate, readmission rate, COVID-19 infection rate) were analyzed and compared across the control and COVID-19 periods., Results: The total emergent urological patients during the COVID-19 period was 42, whereas during the control period, it was 124. The incidence of tube-related emergencies increased from 53% to 88% (P<0.001) during the COVID-19 period. In particular, the incidence of nephrostomy tube-related (31% vs. 15%, P=0.027) and single-J stent-related problems (19% vs. 6%, P=0.009) increased significantly. The mean surgery times across the two periods were comparable. The number of secondary complex operations increased from 12 (18%) to 14 (38%) (P=0.028) during the COVID 19-period. The number of 2-week postoperative readmission decreased from 10 (15%) to 1 (3%) (P=0.049). No participants contracted during the COVID-19 period., Conclusions: Urological tube-related emergencies have been found to have a higher incidence and require more complicated and dangerous operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the optimized management strategies introduced in this study are efficient, and safe for both urologists and patients. Copyright 2021 Translational Andrology and Urology.

0	Impact of COVID-19 on MS patients' access to care and neurologists' treatment practices worldwide: Results from the ectrims survey. Background: Restrictions imposed by the National and local authorities to mitigate the spread of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) posed unique challenges in the access to care and management of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Objective(s): To collect data about the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on access to care for PwMS and analyze influence on treatment practices of MS neurologists worldwide. Method(s): Between March and July 2020 the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) promoted an online survey among Council members and MS specialists worldwide, covering five major areas: general information; MS patient access to care; management of relapses and visits; use of disease modifying therapy (DMT); experience with COVID-19 MS patients. Result(s): Three-hundred-sixty neurologists (46% females, median age 48 years) from 52 countries (Europe 68%; Central/South America 17%; North America 10%, others 5%) completed the survey. Seventy-five percent worked within a specialized MS centre, 42% followed >= 1000 patients. Ninety-eight percent of respondents reported COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on patients' care. Routine MS clinical activities were suspended in 63% of cases and only urgent visits were guaranteed. Telemedicine services (mainly calls, video-calls, messaging) were provided by 90% of respondents: only in 20% of cases telemedicine was already in use in the practice. Forty-five percent revealed changes in relapse treatment: dosage and/or duration reduction 30%; treatment offered only for severe relapses 36%; treatment delivered at home 28%. As for DMT, 98% of respondents felt no modification was needed for interferons and glatiramer; 48-60% deemed no change was needed for dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod and siponimod, while nearly 25% considered switching/suspending these agents based on lymphopenia. On the other hand, for natalizumab 31% applied an extended-dose regimen, for cladribine and alemtuzumab 42-52% considered postponing treatment in any case as the best choice. For anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, postponing treatment in any case (32%) or based on the patient immunophenotype (25%) were the preferred options. Sixty-one percent of respondents had at least one patient affected by COVID-19, 27% had at least one patient with severe infection; 70% of severe cases were on DMT. Finally, 11% of respondents reported at least one COVID-19 related death and 36% of fatal cases were on DMT. Conclusion(s): While analysis of geographic differences is ongoing, the survey highlighted that COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on MS care worldwide. Telemedicine has a great potential to mitigate issues and needs to be potentiated/implemented de novo at most centres. As for DMT, major changes regarded cladribine, alemtuzumab and anti-CD20. Collecting standardized, reliable data on the potential impact of DMT on COVID-19 in PwMS is urgently needed to inform appropriate treatment decisions.	false
0	"A novel STING agonist for cancer immunotherapy and a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adjuvant. A novel STING agonist, CDGSF, ipsilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine, was synthesized. The phosphorothioate in CDGSF might be a site for covalent conjugation. Injection of CDGSF generated an immunogenic (""hot"") tumor microenvironment to suppress melanoma, more efficiently than dithio CDG. In particular, immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using CDGSF as an adjuvant elicited an exceptionally high antibody titer and a robust T cell response, overcoming the drawbacks of aluminum hydroxide. These results highlighted the therapeutic potential of CDGSF for cancer immunotherapy and the adjuvant potential of the STING agonist in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for the first time.

0	Shorter telomere lengths in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The incidence of severe manifestations of COVID-19 increases with age with older patients showing the highest mortality, suggesting that molecular pathways underlying aging contribute to the severity of COVID-19. One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.	false
0	Risk of venous thromboembolic disease in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Introduction: Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present an inflammatory state that conditions a high thrombotic risk. There are several studies about thrombotics events in patients with COVID-19 in ICU but they are limited in size and without report all thrombotic events. Objective(s): To determine the incidence of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the correlation with D-dimer levels. Method(s): A prospective study of critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Inclusion criteria: severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by PCR and admission to the ICU. Exclusion criteria: ECMO, pregnant woman, puerperium, age < 18 years. The study included all patients admitted to the ICU who met the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion on 15-16 April 2020. Ultrasound screening with venous compression bilateral in lower extremities was performed. Asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE was recorded [pulmonary thromboembolism (PD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT)] throughout the ICU stay, patient characteristics, blood test results, and results with 30 days follow-up. Categorical data are expressed as frequency (%). The quantitative data are expressed as mean (standard deviation) or as median (interquartile range 25-75). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared with the T Student test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The association between D-Dimers and VTE has been calculated using the area below the curve (AUROC). Approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Research (PR (AG) 213/2020). Result(s): On 15-16 April 2020, 118 patients [77% male, age mean 59.37 (10.20) years, BMI 30.5 (4.74), 100 (84.74%) with invasive mechanical ventilation] were studied. D-Dimer on the day of the ultrasound screening was 1575 (703.5-2963) ng/mL. VTE was prevalence of 30.5% (36/118). At 30 days of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of VTE was 35% (41/118): 31 DVT, 5 PD, 5 DVT + PD. There were 17 (14%) hemorrhages (4 major and 14 minor). The VTE was not more frequent in ventilated patients. Mortality was 13.6% (16 patients) without difference depending on the existence of thrombosis (5 patients in patients with VTE and 11 in patients without VTE, p ns). Elevation of the D-Dimer above 1500 ng/ml is related to thromboembolic phenomena (AUROC 0.77, p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.62-0.82), sensitivity 73% and specificity 60%. Conclusion(s): Patients admitted to the ICU for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are at high risk of VTE. The elevation of D-Dimers is related to VTE.	false
0	Incidence and mortality of thrombotic complications ICU patients with COVID-19. Introduction: In COVID-19 patients hyperinflamation, immobilisation, hypoxia and vascular dysfunction may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism. Describing these complications is necessary in order to adjust the intensity of thromboprophylaxis specially in critically ill patients who are at increased thrombotic risk. Objective(s): To identify predictive factors and determine the frequency of thrombotic complications in ICU COVID-19 patients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Method(s): Descriptive retrospective study. Statistical analysis was performed with IBMaSPSS Statistics 25. Result(s): 77 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU of our second level hospital were screened between March 6, 2020 and May 6, 2020. All patients were adults diagnosed with respiratory failure and undergoing mechanical ventilation. Demographics, comorbidities, severity score,inflammatory markers, medical and antithrombotic treatment were collected. All these data were analyzed between patients with thrombotic episodes and those who did not, establishing the incidence of thrombosis, the type, the diagnosis used, and analyzed the significance of the risk factors. Of the 77 patients included in the study, 64.9% were male. The average age is 58 +/- 11 years. At admission, the mean APACHE II was 17 +/- 17.32. 40.3% had a history of HT, 70% chronic lung disease, 67.5% DM, 45.5% DL and 74% obesity, with CKD being present in one of the patients and 7.8% previous thrombotic events. 15.5% were oncologic patients. Regarding anti-thrombotic treatment with LMWH, 55.8% received thromboprophylaxis, 16.9% adjusted the dose to weight/renal function, 15.6% received intermediate doses of prophylaxis (1 mg/kg/day) and 10.4% anticoagulant doses. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was 32.5% of the total with DVT being 32% (3 with distal; 2 with distal and proximal; 1 with bilateral; 1 other type) and pulmonar thromboembolism in 76% (6 bilateral; 8 with segmental; 2 with lobar; 3 with massive). Note that, the means of the inflammation parameters were significantly higher in the patients with thrombotic complications compared to those who did not suffer them (D-dimer 63,3 +/- 124vs16 +/- 21 ng/ml, p = 0,001; Il-6 2311 +/- 2767 vs 924 +/- 1175, P = 0,001;PCR 246 +/- 122 vs 215 +/- 117, p = 0,016; Ferritina 6012 +/- 2014 vs 1827 +/- 1560 ng/ml, p = 0,012;LDH 708 +/- 388 vs 1344 +/- 1552 ng/ml, p < 0,01). Paradoxically, mortality among thrombosed patients is not significantly higher. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, despite systematic thrombosis prophylaxis, the 32,5% incidence of thrombotic complications in these patients is remarkably high and well comparable to the VTE incidence in other patient categories, but mortality mong these patients is not significantly higher. D-dimer, IL-6, Ferritina, LDH and PCR level-guided more aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin seem to be a good instrument in critically ill patients but more prospective studies are needed in this regard.	false
0	Comparison of three automatic chemiluminescent immunoassays for monitoring dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. Background: Seldom performance evaluation and diagnosis comparison studies were reported for different chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) kits approved under an emergency approval program for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): A total of 100 and 105 serum separately from non-infected populations and COVID-19 patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. The characteristics including precision, functional sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy were evaluated for Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi CLIA kits. Result(s): Maglumi and iFlash had the best analytical sensitivity for IgM and IgG, respectively. Axceed kits had a linearity response in the detected concentration. The clinical sensitivity of Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi was 68.0%, 64.9%, and 63.9% with a specificity of 99.0%, 96.0%, and 100% for IgM, 85.6%, 97.9%, and 94.8% with a specificity of 97.0% for IgG. ROC analysis indicated all kits had a diagnostic power greater than 0.9. Notably, either IgM or IgG kits obtained a poor agreement (Kappa value from 0.397 to 0.713) with others. Among 38 recovered patients, 94.7% had an effective immune response, and both seropositive IgM and IgG accounted for the biggest proportion (medium, 42 days onset), then followed by the single seropositive IgG (medium, 50 days onset) in Ab profile. Conclusion(s): The performance of CLIA kits satisfied the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both positive of IgG and IgM contributes to improve the specificity, and a positive one will enhance the sensitivity.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Unmet Needs of People With Parkinson's Disease and Their Caregivers During COVID-19-Related Confinement: An Explorative Secondary Data Analysis. Self-perceived unmet needs in people with typical and atypical parkinsonism (PwP) and their caregivers, support network, personalized ways to address self-perceived unmet needs during confinement, as well as the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and self-reported COVID-19 related hospitalization in Luxembourg and the Greater Region were assessed. From 18th March to 10th April 2020, 679 PwP were contacted by phone. Data was collected in the form of a semi-structured interview. The thematic synthesis identified 25 themes where PwP need to be supported in order to cope with consequences of the pandemic, and to adapt their daily and health-related activities. The present work highlights that in the context of personalized medicine, depending on the individual needs of support of the patient the identified self-perceived unmet needs were addressed in various ways ranging from one-directed information over interaction up to proactive counseling and monitoring. Family and health professionals, but also other support systems were taking care of the unmet needs of PwP (e.g., shopping, picking-up medication, etc.) during the pandemic. 7/606 PwP (1.15%) reported COVID-19 related symptoms, 4/606 (0.66%) underwent a rRT-PCR-based diagnostic test and 2/606 (0.33%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive. None of these PwP reported being hospitalized due to COVID-19. Our results will allow health professionals to expand their services in a meaningful way i.e., personalize their support in the identified themes and thus improve the healthcare of PwP in times of crisis.

0	COVID-19 and kidney transplant recipients. Background: The novel coronavirus has become a global threat and healthcare concern. The manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. Aim(s): This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Patients/Methods: Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20, 2020, to May 20, 2020. Result(s): The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8%), followed by fever (62.5%) and cough (45.8%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8%) showed typical findings of patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. Conclusion(s): It seems that COVID-19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O2 saturation, and multilobar view in chest CT scan may be of prognostic value. However, many SARS-CoV-2 demonstrations are similar to those of the general population.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	672 Native American gravidas are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness than non-Native American women. Objective: To evaluate the characteristics of pregnant patients with COVID-19 cared for at the University of New Mexico, the primary referral center for the state of New Mexico and much of the Four Corners region. Furthermore, to evaluate whether the Native American pregnant population is at an increased risk for severe and critical COVID-19 illness compared to other pregnant populations. Study Design: A retrospective chart review was performed of all pregnant and peripartum patients known to been infected with SARS-CoV-2 who presented to either the inpatient or outpatient services at the University of New Mexico through July 31st, 2020. Patients were classified by their most severe presentation into asymptomatic, mild-moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 disease. Result(s): Native American patients were significantly more likely to have severe or critical COVID-19 disease compared with other race groups (p<0.05). Though the Native American group had a higher incidence of medical comorbidities, this did not remain true for the sickest patients. Additionally, obesity levels were not significantly different between groups. Consistent with more severe COVID-19 disease, the proportion of hospitalized patients and length of stay was higher in the Native American group. Conclusion(s): We found a greater proportion of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19-related illness at our institution than has been reported in the scientific literature from other populations. When evaluated by race/ethnicity, we found Native American women to be at a disproportionately higher risk of critical COVID-19 illness with all 6 patients who required critical care being Native American, predominantly from the Dine'e or Navajo Nation. This disparity is alarming; however, the causes and solutions require further investigation. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Longitudinal analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals up to 8 months post-symptom onset. Functional and lasting immune responses to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are currently under intense investigation as antibody titers in plasma have been shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance. Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month period. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd immunity against COVID-19.	false
0	564 Comparison of clinical outcomes in pregnant women with and without COVID-19 based on disease severity. Objective: We sought to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with differing COVID-19 severity (asymptomatic versus symptomatic) to those without COVID-19 infection. Study Design: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women delivering at three hospitals in a large not-for-profit health care organization from March through July 2020. Coarsened exact matching was performed to match women with and without COVID-19 using maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at delivery, parity and institution of delivery. Women without COVID-19 infection was the reference group. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal complications: stillbirth, postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection, endometritis and ICU admission. Outcomes were examined by adjusted binomial logistic regression analysis incorporating matched weights. Result(s): Of 2,714 women who delivered at the three hospitals, 122 (4.5%) women had COVID-19 in the pregnancy. After coarsened exact matching, the study cohort included 486 women, 55 (11.3%) asymptomatic women, 36 (7.4%) symptomatic women and 395 (81.3%) women without disease. Demographic data (Table 1) showed that more Hispanic women were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease and represented the largest proportion in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Although there was an increase in the maternal composite outcome in both asymptomatic and symptomatic women compared to COVID-19 negative women, this was not statistically significant (Table 2). When compared to COVID-19 negative women, symptomatic women are more likely to be diagnosed with intraamniotic infection (aOR 5.3 95% CI [1.02-27.4]) and require ICU admission (aOR 31.9 [95% CI 2.9-344.8]. There were no statistically different neonatal outcomes. Conclusion(s): Women with symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection does not lead to increased odds of overall maternal morbidity compared to women without COVID-19 in pregnancy. This can be considered reassuring information to share with women who are contemplating or are pregnant in the pandemic. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Evaluation of the specificity of six commerciallyavailable SARS-COV-2 screening immunoassays. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID) serological assays are essential for diagnosis, contact tracing, epidemiological studies and to the seroprevalence of the population. Highly specific and sensitive assays are essential to support the clinical diagnosis and especially epidemiological investigations with the aim to study the immunological situation in different populations. The results of such investigations are crucial as a base for future strategic decision making. During the initial months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic many serological assays were developed. These assays target several viral proteins; e.g. SARS-CoV-2 viral spike S1/S2 and nucleocaspid NCP proteins) detecting either IgG alone or total antibodies. Furthermore, several high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serological mass screening assays have been developed and are now commercially. Aim(s): We performed a head-to head comparison of six commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening immunoassays with the primary goal to determine and compare the specificities of these tests. Method(s): 4,044 blood donor plasma archive plasma samples were selected for the test evaluation. The plasma was collected during the March and June 2018, several years prior to the first report of the new SARS-CoV-2 infections. Around 1,000 samples were selected from each month. The plasma samples had been stored in archive plates at -30degreeC. Six SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening immunoassays were selected (name, target, IgG or total AB): (1) Abbott SARS-CoV-2, NCP, IgG; (2) BioRad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 NCP, total AB; (3) DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/ S2 IgG; (4) Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2, NCP, IgG; (5) Euroimmun Anti-SARSCoV- 2, S1, IgG; and (6) Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, S1, total AB. All samples were tested and evaluated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specificities and 99.17% confidence intervals were calculated. Result(s): Following specificities were calculated: (1) Abbott 99.46% (CI 99.07-99.71); (2) BioRad 99.46% (CI 99.17-99.77) (3) DiaSorin 99.09% (CI 98.61-99.43); (4) Euroimmun NCP 99.33% (CI 98.92-99.62); (5) Euroimmun S1 99.55% (CI 99.20-99.78); and (6) Roche 99.83% (CI 99.57-99.95). Four manufactures (BioRad, DiaSorin, Euroimmun NCP and Euroimmun S1 recognise a borderline value as well as a positive value. If these borderline values are considered positive as is often done in diagnostic situations, then the specificities of the assays were calculated as follows: 2) BioRad 99.36% (CI 98.95-99.64) 4) 3) DiaSorin 98.69% (CI 98.14-99.11); 4) Euroimmun NCP 98.96% (CI 98.46-99.33); 5) Euroimmun S1 99.09% (CI 98.61-99.43). Summary/Conclusions: This study demonstrated that all the six commerciallyavailable SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening immunoassays investigated demonstrated high specificities >99%. It is assumed that the positive samples are false positive with cross-reactivity to other antigens. The Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 had the least (7) false positive results. Based on the results of this study all the assays are suitable for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.	false
0	Early therapy with remdesivir and antibody combinations improves COVID-19 disease in mice. Improving the standard of clinical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of single agent therapies has not been comprehensively defined over the time course of infection and it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis model, we show that single-agent therapies exert potent antiviral effects even when initiated relatively late after infection, but their efficacy is diminished as a function of time. RDV and a cocktail of two mAbs in combination provided improved outcomes compared to single agents alone extending the therapeutic window of intervention with less weight loss, decreased virus lung titers, reduced acute lung injury, and improved pulmonary function. Overall, we demonstrate that direct-acting antivirals combined with potent mAb can improve outcomes over single agents alone in animal models of COVID-19 thus providing a rationale for the coupling of therapies with disparate modalities to extend the therapeutic window of treatment.	false
0	How does vulnerability to COVID-19 vary between communities in England? Developing a Small Area Vulnerability Index (SAVI). BACKGROUND: During the initial wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England, several population characteristics were associated with increased risk of mortality-including, age, ethnicity, income deprivation, care home residence and housing conditions. In order to target control measures and plan for future waves of the epidemic, public health agencies need to understand how these vulnerabilities are distributed across and clustered within communities., METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional ecological analysis across 6789 small areas in England. We assessed the association between COVID-19 mortality in each area and five vulnerability measures relating to ethnicity, poverty, prevalence of long-term health conditions, living in care homes and living in overcrowded housing. Estimates from multivariable Poisson regression models were used to derive a Small Area Vulnerability Index., RESULTS: Four vulnerability measures were independently associated with age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality. Each SD increase in the proportion of the population (1) living in care homes, (2) admitted to hospital in the past 5 years for a long-term health condition, (3) from an ethnic minority background and (4) living in overcrowded housing was associated with a 28%, 19% 8% and 11% increase in age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate, respectively., CONCLUSION: Vulnerability to COVID-19 was noticeably higher in the North West, West Midlands and North East regions, with high levels of vulnerability clustered in some communities. Our analysis indicates the communities who will be most at risk from a second wave of the pandemic. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

0	Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 protect against re-infection during outbreaks in care homes, September and October 2020. Two London care homes experienced a second COVID-19 outbreak, with 29/209 (13.9%) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive cases (16/103 residents, 13/106 staff). In those with prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 1/88 (1.1%) individuals (antibody positive: 87; RT-PCR-positive: 1) became PCR-positive compared with 22/73 (30.1%) with confirmed seronegative status. After four months protection offered by prior infection against re-infection was 96.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72.7-99.5%) using risk ratios from comparison of proportions and 96.1% (95% CI: 78.8-99.3%) using a penalised logistic regression model.	false
0	Healthcare associated COVID-19 transmission: Strategies to prevent. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause another problem for healthcare facilities, which is nosocomial transmission. Clinicians performed nosocomial pneumonia prevention vigilantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, the magnitude and risk factors for infection in healthcare environments are unknown in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission. An overwhelming number of COVID-19 infections not only could paralyze the health system but could contribute, above all, to the occasional epidemic of hospital patients and the healthcare workers, along with elevated morbidity and mortality. The COVID-19 increasing case may limit the availability of occupancy rooms in hospitals, so doctors need tools to assess the likelihood of COVID-19 at the initial examination by triage based on epidemiological risks, routine investigations and bedside observation for safe isolation. The specific challenges of COVID-19 exist because this is a new disease with clinical, radiological, and laboratory features that can be variable We review nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The data indicate that the prevalence of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection varies. While reports regarding nosocomial transmission or healthcare-associated COVID-19 infection are still growing, several hospitals claim there were none or minimal nosocomial transmission. Infection prevention and control techniques were initially aimed at prompt patient identification, separation and monitoring in compliance with case descriptions. Engineering controls provide proper and efficient ventilation, likely augmented by filtration of pollutants and air disinfection, air recirculation protection, and overcrowding protection. Administrative assistance to reduce the risk of nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is introduced with the reduction of choice healthcare services, decanting centers, deployment of isolation facilities, appropriate personal security facilities, coordination of the rapid molecular diagnostic laboratory network, constructive monitoring, and organization of the personnel forum and training. These principal strategies can suppress intra-hospital transmission of COVID-19 if strictly implemented during a pandemic era.Copyright © 2020, Yerevan State Medical University.

0	A multiplex microsphere IgG assay for SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2-mediated inhibition as a surrogate for neutralization. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity, and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 prepandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to that of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals (<=5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and >=21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at <=5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% versus 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained >=21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7 [in days from symptom onset]), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP. Taking the data together, this study described the performance of an assay built on a flexible and high-throughput serological platform that proved adaptable to the emergence of a novel infectious agent.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

0	A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The COVID-19 pandemic affects more than 81 million people worldwide with over 1.7 million deaths. As the population returns to work, it is critical to develop tests that reliably detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Here we present results from a multiplex serology test for assessing the antibody responses to COVID-19. In an initial large cohort, this test shows greater than 99% agreement with COVID-19 PCR test. In a second outpatient cohort consisting of adults and children in Colorado, the IgG responses are more robust in positive/symptomatic participants than in positive/asymptomatic participants, the IgM responses in symptomatic participants are transient and largely fall below the detection limit 30 days after symptom onset, and the levels of IgA against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain are significantly increased in participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms compared to those with mild-to-moderate symptoms or asymptomatic individuals. Our results thus provide insight into serology profiling and the immune response to COVID-19.	false
0	763 Hemostasis changes among COVID-19 gravidas during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on rotational thromboelastography. Objective: The novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19, is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that is reported to manifest as coagulopathy in up to 50% of severe cases. Despite a majority of patients receiving low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), data suggests a high incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). Pregnancy is a hypercoaguable state that predisposes gravidas to VTEs. Rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) is a point-of-care viscoelastic device that uses whole blood sample to define coagulation and fibrinolysis in a particular patient. It is shown to be useful in evaluating clot kinetics in trauma and acutely bleeding patients. This study aims to describe the hypercoaguable effect of COVID-19 in gravidas using ROTEM. Study Design: A prospective observational study was employed to collect ROTEM parameters (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM) between May and September 2020 from gravidas on admission for labor or scheduled delivery at Yale-New Haven Hospital. ROTEM was run for panels EXTEM (extrinsic hemostasis), INTEM (intrinsic hemostasis), FIBTEM (fibrin assay). One way ANOVA was performed to assess mean differences in ROTEM parameters between COVID-positive and COVID-negative term gravidas at the time of hospital admission. Result(s): Thirty-nine samples were collected from 19 COVID-positive women and 20 COVID-negative women as the control. Of all standard measurements, the significant findings were: A10 (clot firmness at 10 minutes) [F(2)) = 18.3, p = 0.0001],Mean COVID - = 69.8; Mean COVID + = 61.6;ALPHA (angle between baseline and clotting curve) [F (2)= 4.13, p = 0.05], Mean COVID - = 77.3, Mean COVID + = 74.7;CFT (clot formation time) [F(2) = 5.6, p = 0.02],Mean COVID- = 63.7,Mean COVID + = 79.3 Conclusion(s): These observations support the that COVID-positive gravidas are more hypercoaguable than their COVID-negative matches.Though statistical significance is demonstrated in this early data, a more robust exploration of this population is needed to determine whether clinical significance exists as well in this at-risk group.Copyright © 2020	false
0	565 Timing of COVID-19 during pregnancy and impact on placental pathology. Objective: To characterize the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) proximate and remote from delivery on placental pathology. Study Design: Within a prospective cohort study of pregnant women undergoing universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery, placental pathology was performed for all SARS-CoV-2 positive women over a 3-month period. Serologic testing was performed on a subset of patients for clinical or research purposes. Acute COVID-19 was defined as RT-PCR positive women with COVID-19 onset within 2 weeks of delivery, based on symptom history and/or negative serology or positive IgM only. Non-acute COVID-19 was defined as women with COVID-19 onset >2 weeks from delivery, based on symptom history, prior positive RT-PCR, and/or positive IgG serology. A subset of SARS-CoV-2 negative women whose placentas were examined for routine indications were included as negative controls in an additional analysis. Demographic, clinical, and obstetric data were abstracted from the medical record. All placentas were examined by a senior pathologist, and lesions categorized according to the Amsterdam criteria. The primary outcome was fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM); the secondary outcome was maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM). Result(s): 90 placentas were evaluated from 63 non-acute and 27 acute cases. There were no differences in clinical characteristics by exposure group (Table 1). Placentas of women with acute COVID-19 had significantly more FVM lesions compared to women with non-acute COVID-19 (51.9% vs 19.0%, p=0.004), while frequency of MVM lesions did not differ by exposure (29.6% vs 30.2%, p>0.99) (Table 2). When including 188 SARS-CoV-2 negative, control placentas, FVM lesions remained significantly more frequent among acute than either non-acute or control cases (p<0.001; data not shown). Conclusion(s): Placental pathology may differ based on the timing of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. Increased frequency of FVM during acute infection may reflect pregnancy-specific sequelae of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and the implications for maternal or neonatal thrombotic events requires further study.

0	Sexual Orientation Disparities in Risk Factors for Adverse COVID-19-Related Outcomes, by Race/Ethnicity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2017-2019. Sexual minority persons experience health disparities associated with sexual stigma and discrimination and have a high prevalence of several health conditions that have been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). Current COVID-19 surveillance systems do not capture information about sexual orientation. To begin bridging the gap in knowledge about COVID-19 risk among sexual minority adults, CDC examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults in the prevalence of underlying conditions with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe COVID-19-related illness (3), by using data from the 2017-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). * When age, sex, and survey year are adjusted, sexual minority persons have higher prevalences than do heterosexual persons of self-reported cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease (including myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease), obesity, smoking, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and stroke. Sexual minority adults who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic also have higher prevalences of several of these health conditions than do racial/ethnic minority adults who are heterosexual. Collecting data on sexual orientation in COVID-19 surveillance and other studies would improve knowledge about disparities in infection and adverse outcomes by sexual orientation, thereby informing more equitable responses to the pandemic.	false
0	789 Association of food deserts and coronavirus severity in pregnancy. Objective: Socioeconomic disparities play an important role in disease epidemiology and outcome. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether pregnant women with Coronavirus infection living in a food desert, as defined by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are at increased risk of having more severe disease reflected as need for hospitalization. Study Design: In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed electronic medical records of all pregnant patients with coronavirus in our urban 3-hospital system for demographics, potential co-morbidities and outcomes between April-August 2020. Food deserts were defined by the USDA as low income neighborhoods more than half-mile from a supermarket. The patients' location was mapped on the Food Access Research Atlas to determine whether each patient lived within a food desert. Comparisons between those with Coronavirus requiring hospitalization and those who remained asymptomatic were made using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The cohort consisted of 81 pregnant patients with coronavirus, 45% asymptomatic and 55% symptomatic. The majority (70.9%) were Hispanic, and obese (BMI>30 70%) with 27.2% living in a food desert. Symptomatic patients were significantly more likely to reside in a food desert (90.9% versus 41.4%, p<.0001, OR 14.167, 95% CI 3.023, 66.388). No other significant differences were identified on univariate analysis for any demographic or potential confounders. Logistic regression modeling confirmed food desert residence to be the only independent predictor of need for hospitalization in those with Coronavirus in our cohort (see Table 1). Conclusion(s): The results of this study revealed an association between living in a food desert and developing symptomatic coronavirus. However, with such wide confidence intervals, a larger population analysis is indicated to confirm this association, and if confirmed would serve as an opportunity to change a modifiable socioeconomic risk factor for Coronavirus disease severity in pregnancy.

0	COVID-19 Impact on Health & Well-Being Survey: Measuring Depression and Anxiety Among Individuals Sheltering at Home. Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify factors impacting mental health while sheltering at home. Method(s): English or Spanish speaking adults (n=834) responded April to July 2020 to online survey and self-reported information on demographics, symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), stressors and factors of resilience. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were categorized: none to moderate (0-14) and moderately severe to severe (>=15) depression. Similarly, anxiety was categorized: minimal to mild (0-9) and moderate to severe (>= 10). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to measure associations between covariates and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Result(s): Respondents were female (78%), Hispanic (56%), with household incomes over $70,000 (53%) and currently sheltering at home (76%). Approximately, 13% and 19% reported moderately severe to severe depression and anxiety. Sheltering at home, job loss, and working in healthcare were not associated with depression or anxiety. Being Hispanic (OR=1.65; 95% CI:1.03, 2.64), single (OR=3.58; 95% CI: 2.17, 5.91), 3 or more children in household (OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.62), no insurance (OR=3.82, 95% CI: 2.33, 6.25), and abuse (OR=2.19; 95% CI: 1.35 to 3.54) were associated with increased odds of moderately severe to severe depression; with similar findings for moderate to severe anxiety. Conclusion(s): Sheltering at home was not associated with levels of depression or anxiety during the pandemic. We present important drivers of depression and anxiety for a predominately Hispanic female population currently sheltering at home.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Recent Advances in Nanomaterials based Biosensors for Point of Care (PoC) Diagnosis of Covid-19 - A Minireview. Early diagnosis and ultrahigh sample throughput screening are the need of the hour to control the geological spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional laboratory tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography are implemented for the detection of COVID-19. However, they are limited by the laborious sample collection and processing procedures, longer wait time for test results and skilled technicians to operate sophisticated facilities. In this context, the point of care (PoC) diagnostic platform has proven to be the prospective approach in addressing the abovementioned challenges. This review emphasizes the mechanism of viral infection spread detailing the host-virus interaction, pathophysiology, and the recent advances in the development of affordable PoC diagnostic platforms for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. First, the well-established optical and electrochemical biosensors are discussed. Subsequently, the recent advances in the development of PoC biosensors, including lateral flow immunoassays and other emerging techniques, are highlighted. Finally, a focus on integrating nanotechnology with wearables and smartphones to develop smart nanobiosensors is outlined, which could promote COVID-19 diagnosis accessible to both individuals and the mass population at patient care.

0	Exploratory study on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general Brazilian population. The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the main international concerns regarding its impact on mental health. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and behavioral aspects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a Brazilian population. An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic. That said, it should be emphasized that these findings are preliminary and portray a moment still being faced by many people amid the pandemic and quarantine measures. Therefore, we understand that the magnitude of the impacts on mental health will only be more specific with continuous studies after total relaxation of the quarantine.	false
0	COVID-19, COPD, and AECOPD: Immunological, Epidemiological, and Clinical Aspects. The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes several heterogeneous clinical conditions collectively known as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Older patients with significant cardiovascular conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are predisposed to a more severe disease complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. COPD is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, and viruses are among the top causes of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Thus, COVID-19 could represent the ultimate cause of AECOPD. This review will examine the pathobiological processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the effects of cigarette smoke and COPD on the immune system and vascular endothelium, and the known effects of cigarette smoke on the onset and progression of COVID-19. We will also review the epidemiological data on COVID-19 prevalence and outcome in patients with COPD and analyze the pathobiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of other known viral causes of AECOPD. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 shares common pathobiological and clinical features with other viral agents responsible for increased morbidity, thus representing a novel cause of AECOPD with the potential for a more long-term adverse impact. Longitudinal studies aimed at COPD patients surviving COVID-19 are needed to identify therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV2 and prevent the disease's burden in this vulnerable population.

0	"A Comprehensive Systematic Review of CSF analysis that defines Neurological Manifestations of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Limited literature exists on CSF findings in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. In this review, we conducted a descriptive analysis of CSF findings in patients with COVID-19 to understand prognosis and explore therapeutic options. METHOD(S): We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus databases using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complications"""" for reports of CSF findings in COVID-19 related neurological manifestations. Descriptive analysis were conducted to observe the CSF protein and cell counts based on age, gender, severity and fatality of COVID-19, and whether central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). RESULT(S): A total of 113 patients were identified from 67 studies. Of these, 7 patients (6.2 %) were fatal COVID-19 cases and 35 patients (31%) were considered severe COVID-19 cases. CSF protein was elevated in 100% (7/7) of the fatal cases with an average of 61.28mg/dl, and in 65.0 % (52/80) in non-fatal cases with an average 56.73mg/dl. CSF protein levels were elevated in 74.5% (38/51) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 68.6% (24/35) in those with a severe COVID-19 infection. CSF cell count was increased in 43% of fatal cases, 25.7% severe cases and 29.4% of non-severe cases. CONCLUSION(S): Our analysis showed that the most common CSF picture in COVID-19 infection is elevated protein with very occasionally mild lymphocyte predominant pleiocytosis. Further studies to elucidate pathophysiology of neurological complications in COVID-19 are recommended.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."	false
0	First use of NxStage portable intermittent haemodialysis in ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT during COVID-19 pandemic in UK. Introduction: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought extraordinary demands on many Intensive Care Units (ICU) in the UK. Our ICU faced an unprecedent rate of admissions [ref1], with 32.7% of patients requiring Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) [ref2]. Pre-pandemic, our conventional RRT was Continuous Veno Venous Haemofiltration (CVVHF), favoured over other modalities in view of more stable haemodynamic profile [ref3]. With a shortage of RRT machines, consumables, and trained workforce, we explored NxStage Pure Flow System and Cycler (NxS) as an alternative to provide portable intermittent haemodialysis (iHD) as RRT in ICU. Method(s): This study was designed as a service evaluation to review NxS safety and efficacy, including all patients with COVID-19 and AKI Stage 3 by KDIGO criteria treated with NxS between 24/04 and 24/06/2020. Exclusion criteria were liver failure or haemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors. Study approval SE20/015 (28/05/2020). Result(s): Ten consecutive patients were included, 9/10 male, all of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity; mean age 54.9 years (SD 11.7). 7/10 had diabetes, 6/10 had hypertension, one had chronic kidney disease. All patients had radiological features typical for COVID-19 and 7 had positive nasopharyngeal swab. In the first 24 hours in ICU, mean APACHE II score was 19.8 (SD 5.7) and PaO2/ FiO2 ratio 137mmHg (SD 69). All patients were intubated and ventilated during admission. 45 NxS treatments were delivered over two months, with a median of 3.5 days of NxS per patient (IQR 1.5-8), versus 14 days of CVVHDF (IQR 8-22.5). 5 of 45 treatments were aborted: 3 secondary to vascular access mechanical issues, one for change in therapeutic priority, and one for hypotension requiring metaraminol. Adverse events per patient are detailed in the table below. 7/10 patients developed hypokalaemia during NxS, requiring replacement in 24 of 45 treatments, without any arrhythmia. 36 treatments were delivered through standard vascath, and 9 through TesioCath. We report one bleeding episode from TesioCath site, but no episodes of catheter-associated thrombosis, nor any pneumothorax secondary to dialysis catheter insertion. We report 3 episodes of dialysis catheter associated sepsis, versus 26 septic episodes from other sources. The pH variation over NxS treatment remained stable and no patient was acidotic at the end of NxS treatment. Serum lactate level increased during all treatments, by virtue of the lactate buffer used, and decreased to the normal reference range within five hours of NxS completion in 31 of 45 cases, without clinical sequelae in the remaining cases. Efficacy was described by achieving the target fluid balance in 40/45 treatments, and reducing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) post-NxS compared to pre-NxS in 37/45 treatments (on average 5.1 mmol/l less than pre-NxS BUN samples, p < 0.01 on paired t test). 8/10 patients survived to ICU discharge or last follow up; 3 have been discharged home, 2 remain in hospital and 3 in ICU. Mean ICU length of stay was 38.7 days (SD 16.8). At ICU discharge, median eGFR was 73 mL/min/1.73 m2 (IQR 14 - 84) with no dialysis dependence. Conclusion(s): This pilot project was developed and delivered through necessity, and it was not designed to compare or displace the use of CVVHF by iHD in ICU [ref4], but proved that NxS is safe and effective in selected patients in order to preserve the use of CVVHF for patients who are haemodynamically unstable or with liver failure.

0	Enriching neuroimmunology telemedicine encounters with objective measures of vision during the sarscov- 2 pandemic. Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and antibodymediated optic neuritis attend periodic outpatient clinic visits to quantify visual acuity, color vision and visual fields. Many of these tests involve prolonged proximity and contact, which patients who are immunocompromised may wish to avoid during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Telemedicine is increasingly used to lessen the need for clinic visits but lacks objective means for vision monitoring. Objective(s): With the goal of enriching pandemic telemedicine encounters, we conducted a pilot study testing the feasibility of telemedicine-guided computer tests for monitoring vision. Method(s): For this pilot study, 22 patients with optic neuropathies from the Neuro-Ophthalmology outpatient clinic were recruited. Participants were asked to repeat their clinic eye exams with a home-based adaptation of the Freiburg Acuity Test (FRACT ), a robust and validated computer-based method for measuring visual acuity, the EYESAGE visual field test (http:// www.eyesage.org/?lang=us), and a computer-based Ishihara color perception application. Blinded reviewers interpreted the results of both home-based and outpatient tests, and the correlation of the results was analyzed alongside patient cooperation and reliability indices. Result(s): 18/22 patients completed the visual monitoring tests during the telemedicine-guided encounters. Patients' mean age was 44yrs. (SD 13.42), of whom four were male. Patients with low vision (n=2, one patient with hand motion, second patient 6/30) on clinic visit had a similar low visual acuity with the telemedicine guided FRACT method. No patient with good FRACT vision had low visual acuity documented during their clinic visit. Significant visual field defects (n=6, homonymous hemianopsia and quadrantanopia (n=3), inferior altitudinal (n=1) and central scotomas (n=2)) were all picked up by the EYESAGE home method. Smaller nasal steps and peripheral concentric field scotomas were unreliably detected by the EYESAGE method. Conclusion(s): This pilot study of enriching telemedicine visits with a method for monitoring vision reveals that FRACT and EYESAGE potentially identify low visual acuities and severe visual field defects. Further improvement of home vision monitoring methods can enrich telemedicine encounters with objective means of monitoring vision. A large-scale multicenter international study is currently underway to examine the sensitivity of these visual monitoring methods in patients with demyelinating disease.	false
0	Sleep Conditions Associate with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms among Pregnant Women during the Epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Background: Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. Method(s): An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. Result(s): In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. Limitation(s): Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. Conclusion(s): Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Drastic Reduction of Bacterial, Fungal and Viral Pathogen Titers by Cuprous Oxide Impregnated Medical Textiles. Hospital patients and personnel are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, as clearly manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission of respiratory viral pathogens can occur through contaminated surfaces, including from medical textiles. Copper has potent biocidal properties, and cuprous oxide impregnated medical textiles (CMT) reduce hospital-acquired bacterial infections. In the current study we confirm the antimicrobial properties of CMT and determine their capacity to reduce infectious titres of human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in an independent laboratory. The antibacterial and antiviral activities of the CMT were determined according to AATCC TM100-2019 and ISO 18184:2019 standards, respectively. The CMT reduced by 4 logs the viable titers of MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida auris after 2 h of incubation. Viable titers of Clostridium difficile were reduced by 2.3, 3, and 4 logs after 2, 6, and 18 h, respectively. Infectious titers of HCoV-229E exposed to CMT for 2 h were reduced by 2.8 and 4 logs (99.85% and 99.99% reductions) as compared to Time-0 control and initial inoculum, respectively. The CMT retain their antibacterial efficacy even after 100 industrial washings. Use of cuprous oxide impregnated textiles in clinical settings may reduce not only hospital acquired infections caused by bacterial and fungal pathogens, but also, and equally important, those caused by coronavirus and other viruses.	false
0	Multiple organ injury on admission predicts in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Multiorgan injury has been implicated in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to assess the impact of organ injury (OI) on prognosis according to the number of affected organs at admission. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Third Hospital & Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from February 17 to March 22, 2020. We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of CRP were at a higher risk of death compared with those without. Patients with three organ injuries had the highest mortality rate (57.9%; hazard ratio [HR] with 95% confidence interval [CI] vs. patients without OI: 22.31 [10.42-47.77], those with two [23.6%; HR = 8.68, 95% CI = 4.58-16.48], one [8.6%; HR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.7-5.7], or no OI [2.6%]; p <.001). The increasing number of OI was associated with a high risk of mortality in COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"Psychological and psychiatric impact of COVID-19 pandemic among children and adolescents. Background: COVID-19 outbreak and the unprecedent measures imposed by the government, including quarantine and social distancing, cause psychological distress in children and adolescents. Method(s): we review literature about mental health effects of COVID-19 pandemic by using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", ""pandemic"", ""mental health"", ""psych*"", ""adolescent"" and ""child"". Result(s): early evidence show high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, due to the pandemic itself, to social isolation and to parents' stress. High grade students, females and low-income families are at higher risk to de-velop psychiatric symptoms. Psychological distress can be reduced by maintaining contact with peers through social networks and by accurate updates provided by the government through the mass media. Online resources such as information about mental health education and preventive measure, video-counselling, telemedicine and telepsychiatry services, can be useful to reduce the psychosocial effects of the novel coronavirus. Conclusion(s): there is urgent need to plan new strategies for early psychological interventions in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents mental health status.

0	The Mental Well-Being of Frontline Physicians Working in Civil Wars Under Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Conditions. Background and Objective:  Emergency medical physicians are regarded as essential frontline staff in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These health-care workers are faced with significant stressors in addition to the usual stress felt in their regular work. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and burnout among emergency physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Using a cross-sectional study methodology, we surveyed physicians active on April 2020 to study depression and anxiety [using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and burnout [using the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) scale]. Results: A total of 154 emergency physicians completed the survey. We found that about 65.6% of patients were experiencing anxiety (based on a HADS score >= 11), and 73.4% were displaying depressive symptoms. For burnout, three subscales indicated that 67.5% endured emotional exhaustion, and 48.1% experienced depersonalization (defined as a score of >=10 on aMBI). A total of 21.4% of respondents perceived a sense of personal underachievement, defined as a score of <10 via aMBI. Conclusion:  Physicians' psychological status is crucial and plays a major role in their well-being, affecting their work satisfaction. Therefore, implementing strategies aimed at decreasing the impact of stressful events is crucial to alleviate the distress experienced by physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	The association between sleep quality, depression, anxiety and stress levels, and temporomandibular joint disorders among Turkish dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to examine the association between sleep quality, depression, anxiety and stress levels, and the frequency of temporomandibular disorders in a sample of Turkish dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The current cross-sectional study was conducted with 699 dental university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fonseca Anamnestic Index (FAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used in the present study. Results: The incidence of temporomandibular joint disorders in the present study was found to be 77.5%. Female students' FAI scores were found to be statistically significantly higher than males (p < 0.05). Additionally, higher depression and anxiety and stress levels caused increased PSQI and FAI scores. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased temporomandibular joint disorders were observed with increased impaired sleep quality and higher depression, anxiety and stress levels among dental university students.	false
0	Neurological Aspects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 - which causes COVID-19 - has rapidly reached pandemic proportions, causing widespread morbidity and mortality. It has had a major impact on society in general, and in medicine and health in particular. Although primarily a potentially fatal respiratory pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can be neurotropic. Its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed in endothelial cells in the brain and can be induced in neural cells. COVID-19 is therefore of high relevance to neurological disease. Indeed, various neurological manifestations are increasingly being reported. On the other hand, COVID-19 has a major impact on people with certain neurological diseases. Patients with neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis who are on immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatments may be more susceptible to infection or have a more severe disease due to a blunted immune response. Patients with many neurological disorders may be at risk of severe COVID-19 infection, due to immobility, frailty, disability, diminished respiratory capacity or cognitive dysfunction. Disease-specific patient organisations and neurological societies have been prompt in providing advice and generating guidelines for various neurological conditions. Local, national and international registers are being created and will be essential in monitoring the disease and its outcomes. New knowledge about COVID-19, including issues of relevance to neurology, is generated daily. This review presents some succinct background information on coronaviruses and its neuro-invasive potential, the current knowledge of neurological manifestations, and the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with neurological disease.

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap). Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap. Results Across the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth. Interpretation Mobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide the provincial and regional implementation and loosening of physical distancing measures.	false

BACKGROUND: Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI) have risen steadily in recent years, and racial and ethnic minorities have borne the disproportionate burden of STI increases in the United States. Historical inequities and social determinants of health are significant contributors to observed disparities and affect access to diagnostic testing for STI. CONTENT: Public health systems rely heavily on laboratory medicine professionals for diagnosis and reporting of STI. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians and laboratory professionals be familiar with issues underlying disparities in STI incidence and barriers to reliable diagnostic testing. In this mini-review, we will summarize contributors to racial/ethnic disparity in STI, highlight current epidemiologic trends for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, discuss policy issues that affect laboratory and public health funding, and identify specific analytic challenges for diagnostic laboratories. SUMMARY: Racial and ethnic disparities in STI in the US are striking and are due to complex interactions of myriad social determinants of health. Budgetary cuts for laboratory and public health services and competition for resources during the COVID-19 pandemic are major challenges. Laboratory professionals must be aware of these underlying issues and work to maximize efforts to ensure equitable access to diagnostic STI testing for all persons, particularly those most disproportionately burdened by STI.Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

0	Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19: A narrative review. Introduction: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that has spread rapidly throughout the world. This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discussion(s): Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data. Conclusion(s): The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.Copyright © Ordem dos Medicos 2020.	false
0	Use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 in India: A review & practical guidelines. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is one of the promising therapies being tried for COVID-19 patients. This passive immunity mode involves separating preformed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from a recently recovered COVID-19 patient and infusing it into a patient with active disease or an exposed individual for prophylaxis. Its advantages include ease of production, rapid deployment, specificity against the target infectious agent, and scalability. In the current pandemic, it has been used on a large scale across the globe and also in India. However, unequivocal proof of efficacy and effectiveness in COVID-19 is still not available. Various CP therapy parameters such as donor selection, antibody quantification, timing of use, and dosing need to be considered before its use. The current review attempts to summarize the available evidence and provide recommendations for setting up CP protocols in clinical and research settings.	false
0	Elderly's food security and its associated socioeconomic determinants in Tehran: A cross-sectional study. Introduction: The mechanism by which a suppressed immune system of a cancer patient makes them susceptible to COVID-19 is still unclear. Any delay or discontinuation of cancer care due to the pandemic is expected to have a detrimental impact on the outcome of cancer. A few studies have addressed the incidence of COVID-19 among cancer patients, but the small sample size of such studies makes it difficult to draw inference to the general population., Methods: For our review, 'Pubmed' database and Google search engines were used for searching the relevant articles. The criterion used for review includes their relevance to the defined review question, which is the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 among cancer patients and the relevant therapeutic interventions therewith. This review includes 20 studies and other relevant literature which address the determinants of COVID-19 among Cancer patients., Results: Delay in cancer diagnosis will increase the stage progression of cancer patients and increased mortality in the future. A short delay in administering cancer related treatment to aid the odds of patient surviving the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be at the discretion of the treating Physician. Oncologists dilemma in the current situation includes titrating the density of drug doses and intensity of treatment regimen, for the optimal management of metastatic and adjuvant cancer patients. Patients are thus subjected to suboptimal treatment and undetected disease recurrence, To circumvent the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, Providers need to consider staggered regimen or alternate therapies such as biological/immunotherapy, targeted therapy, anti-angiogenic drugs, hormone therapy and/or antibody-based therapeutics., Conclusion: This review provides insights on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which could enable Physicians in formulating therapeutic strategies for the management of severe patients, more so in Oncology settings, thus reducing the mortality. The key is to balance the continuation of urgent cancer care, but rationing the elective treatment according to the circumstances. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	A critical review of point-of-care diagnostic technologies to combat viral pandemics. The COVID-19 global pandemic of 2019-2020 pointedly revealed the lack of diagnostic solutions that are able to keep pace with the rapid spread of the virus. Despite the promise of decades of lab-on-a-chip research, no commercial products were available to deliver rapid results or enable testing in the field at the onset of the pandemic. In this critical review, we assess the current state of progress on the development of point-of-care technologies for the diagnosis of viral diseases that cause pandemics. While many previous reviews have reported on progress in various lab-on-a-chip technologies, here we address the literature from the perspective of the testing needs of a rapidly expanding pandemic. First, we recommend a set of requirements to heed when designing point-of-care diagnostic technologies to address the testing needs of a pandemic. We then review the current state of assay technologies with a focus on isothermal amplification and lateral-flow immunoassays. Though there is much progress on assay development, we argue that the largest roadblock to deployment exists in sample preparation. We summarize current approaches to automate sample preparation and discuss both the progress and shortcomings of these developments. Finally, we provide our recommendations to the field of specific challenges to address in order to prepare for the next pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	mRNA-1273 efficacy in a severe COVID-19 model: attenuated activation of pulmonary immune cells after challenge. The mRNA-1273 vaccine was recently determined to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interim Phase 3 results. Human studies, however, cannot provide the controlled response to infection and complex immunological insight that are only possible with preclinical studies. Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose. Unlike in mice and non-human primates, mRNA-1273- mediated immunity was non-sterilizing and coincided with an anamnestic response. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue permitted high resolution analysis which is not possible in vaccinated humans. mRNA-1273 prevented inflammatory cell infiltration and the reduction of lymphocyte proportions, but enabled antiviral responses conducive to lung homeostasis. Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters. Our results support the use of mRNA-1273 in a two-dose schedule and provides insight into the potential responses within the lungs of vaccinated humans who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	94 Perinatal outcomes of asymptomatic versus symptomatic COVID positive pregnant women. Objective: COVID-19 infection may be associated with placental changes including vasculopathy and thrombosis. The extent to which these findings translate to perinatal outcomes and correlate to symptomatology is unclear. The aim of the study is to examine whether placentally related perinatal outcomes differ in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic COVID positive women. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of women with singleton gestations diagnosed with COVID infection by PCR and admitted to our institution for delivery from 3/12- 8/12/20. Women were categorized as symptomatic if they had COVID symptoms prior to or at presentation for delivery or developed any until discharge. Asymptomatic women did not develop any symptoms during the same period. Pregnancies with major congenital anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was a perinatal composite of any of the following: small for gestational age, preeclampsia or abruption. Secondary outcomes are listed in Table 1. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables. We fit a logistic regression model to adjust for confounders. Result(s): Of 189 COVID positive women admitted for delivery, 157 met inclusion criteria. 95(60.5%) women were asymptomatic and 62(39.4%) symptomatic. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups(Table 1A). The primary outcome was similar between the groups (24.2% vs 21%, p=0.64). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of birthweight, mode of delivery, NICU admission, blood transfusion or ICU admission. There were no cases of VTE. Symptomatic COVID infection was associated with higher risk for cesarean delivery (CD) for non-reassuring fetal status (p=0.035) and longer hospital stay (p<0.001)(Table 1B). After adjusting for confounders, the primary outcome was similar between groups (OR: 0.78, 95%CI 0.34, 1.77). Conclusion(s): COVID positive pregnant women had similar placentally related outcomes, irrespective of symptomatology. Symptomatic women were associated with higher risk for CD for non-reassuring fetal status and had longer hospital stay. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2019	false
0	A computational modeling study of covid-19 in Bangladesh. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally. Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (gamma). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (beta) and Rt. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8beta, 1.2gamma) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8beta, 1.2gamma) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	false
0	[Is Disinfection of Public Surfaces useful for the Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infections?]. Measures to control SARS-CoV-2 often include the regular disinfection of public surfaces. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection on surfaces in the surrounding of confirmed cases was evaluated in this systematic review. Overall, 26 studies showed 0 and 100% rates of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in the surrounding of patients. Seven studies with at least 100 samples mostly showed detection rates between 1.4 and 19%. Two other studies did not detect infectious SARS-CoV-2 on any surface. Similar results were obtained from surfaces in the surrounding of confirmed SARS- and influenza-patients. A contamination of public surfaces with infectious virus is considerably less likely because there are much less potential viral spreaders around a surface, the contact time between a person and the surface is much shorter, and the asymptomatic carriers typically have no symptoms. In addition, a hand contact with a contaminated surface transfers only a small part of the viral load. A simple cleaning reduces the number of infectious viruses already by 2 log10-steps. That is why public surfaces should in general be cleaned because the wide use of biocidal agents for surface disinfection further increases the microbial selection pressure without an expectable health benefit.

0	Coronavirus infection in hip fractures (CHIP) study. AIMS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence of hip fracture has not changed. Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined., METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality., RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance., CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.	false
0	High Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients With Cancer. Background and Aim: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data on the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms in patients with cancer are limited. We sought to characterize the GI manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in oncology patients. Materials and Methods: We performed a multicenter cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 9 Massachusetts medical centers and identified those with an active malignancy. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of GI symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer. Results: Of 395 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 36 (9%) had an active malignancy. Of the 36 cancer patients, 23 (63%) reported >= 1 new GI symptom. The most prevalent symptoms were anorexia (12, 52%), diarrhea (9, 39%), and vomiting (8, 35%). GI symptoms were the initial symptom in 4/36 (11%) patients, were the predominant symptom in 5/36 (14%) patients, and were severe in 4/23 (17%) patients. Four of 5 patients with GI symptoms at presentation reported concurrent fever; notably 1 patient had no fever or respiratory symptoms. Twelve (33%) patients had elevations in liver transaminases at presentation; patients with elevated transaminases were more likely to have associated GI symptoms (83% vs. 54%, P=0.04). Conclusions: Acute GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 are highly prevalent in hospitalized cancer patients and can occur as a presenting symptom without respiratory symptoms. Symptoms are severe in a small subset of patients.	false
0	Temporal development and neutralising potential of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised COVID-19 patients: An observational cohort study. Antibody responses are important in the control of viral respiratory infection in the human host. What is not clear for SARS-CoV-2 is how rapidly this response occurs, or when antibodies with protective capability evolve. Hence, defining the events of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and the time frame for the development of antibodies with protective potential may help to explain the different clinical presentations of COVID-19. Furthermore, accurate descriptions of seroconversion are needed to inform the best use of serological assays for diagnostic testing and serosurveillance studies. Here, we describe the humoral responses in a cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients (n = 19) shortly following the onset of symptoms. Commercial and 'in-house' serological assays were used to measure IgG antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens-Spike (S) S1 sub-unit and Nucleocapsid protein (NP)-and to assess the potential for virus neutralisation mediated specifically by inhibition of binding between the viral attachment protein (S protein) and cognate receptor (ACE-2). Antibody response kinetics varied amongst the cohort, with patients seroconverting within 1 week, between 1-2 weeks, or after 2 weeks, following symptom onset. Anti-NP IgG responses were generally detected earlier, but reached maximum levels slower, than anti-S1 IgG responses. The earliest IgG antibodies produced by all patients included those that recognised the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were capable of inhibiting binding to ACE-2. These data revealed events and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion that may be important predictors of the outcome of infection and guide the delivery of clinical services in the COVID-19 response.	false
0	Feasibility and predictive performance of a triage system for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: Triage procedures have been implemented to limit hospital access and minimize infection risk among cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the absence of prospective evidence, we aim to evaluate the predictive performance of a triage system in the oncological setting., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzes hospital admissions to the Oncology and Hematology Department of Udine, Italy, during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 30th to April 30th , 2020). A total of 3923 triage procedures were performed, and data of 1363 individual patients were reviewed., RESULTS: A self-report triage questionnaire identified 6% of triage-positive procedures, with a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI: 43.0%-85.4%), a specificity of 94.3% (95% CI: 93.5%-95.0%), and a positive predictive value of 5.9% (95% CI: 4.3%-8.0%) for the identification of patients who were not admitted to the hospital after medical review. Patients with thoracic cancer (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.13-2.53, p=0.01), younger age (OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.15-2.01, p<0.01), and body temperature at admission >=37degreeC (OR 9.52, 95% CI: 5.44-16.6, p<0.0001) had increased risk of positive triage. Direct hospital access was warranted to 93.5% of cases, a further 6% was accepted after medical evaluation, whereas 0.5% was refused at admission., CONCLUSIONS: A self-report questionnaire has a low positive predictive value to triage patients with cancer and suspected SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Differential diagnosis with tumor- or treatment-related symptoms is always required to avoid unnecessary delays. Body temperature measurement improves the triage process's overall sensitivity, and widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing should be implemented to identify asymptomatic carriers., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study to provide data on the predictive performance of a triage system in the oncological setting during the COVID-19 outbreak. A questionnaire-based triage has a low positive predictive value to triage patients with cancer and suspected SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, and a differential diagnosis with tumor- or treatment-related symptoms is mandatory to avoid unnecessary treatment delays. Consequently, adequate recourses should be reallocated for a triage implementation in the oncological setting. Of note, body temperature measurement improves the triage process's overall sensitivity, and widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be implemented to identify asymptomatic carriers.

0	Performance of two rapid point of care SARS-COV-2 antibody assays against laboratory-based automated chemiluminescent immunoassays for SARS-COV-2 IG-G, IG-M and total antibodies. Introduction: We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antibody point-of-care tests (POCTs) (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM and Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody tests) and compared the results to their respective chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) (Abbott Architect IgM, Architect IgG, Roche Cobas total antibody assays)., Method: 200 pre-pandemic sera and 48 samples positive for various conditions (18 viral hepatitis, 18 dengue, 11 ANA and 1 dsDNA) were used as controls and to assess for cross-reactivity. Anonymised residual leftover sera positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were recruited as cases (n = 133). The sensitivity/specificity/cross-reactivity/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of the POCTs were assessed. Concordance between the POCTs and chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) were analysed., Results: Abbott/Roche POCT specificity was 98.7%/100% (95% CI 96.5-99.8/98.5-100) and sensitivity was 97.2%/97.2% (95% CI 85.5-99.9/85.5-99.9) in cases >=14 days post-first positive RT-PCR (POS), PPV was 68.7%/100% (95% CI 41.3-87.2/94.7-100.0), and NPV was 97.4%/97.6% (95% CI 97.0-97.8/97.2-98.0). In cases >=14 days POS, concordance of Abbott/Roche POCT and CLIAs was 97.2%/100% (35/36 and 36/36 results). The sensitivity of individual IgM-band results on both POCTs did not increase >95% even after 14 days POS (Abbott 2.78%, Roche 44.4%)., Conclusion: Both POCTs have good specificity, little cross-reactivity with other antibodies, and sensitivity >95% when used in subjects >=14 days POS. Analysis of individual POCT IgG/IgM-bands did not provide any additional information. POCTs can substitute for CLIAs in cases >=14 days POS. In low prevalence areas, POCTs would be especially useful when combined with antigen testing in an orthogonal format to increase the PPV of COVID-19 results. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.	false
0	Top five ethical lessons of COVID-19 that the world must learn. As the world reflects upon one year since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prepare for and experience surges in cases, it is important to identify the most crucial ethical issues that might lie ahead so that countries are able to plan accordingly. Some ethical issues are rather obvious to predict, such as the ethical issues surrounding the use of immunity certificates, contact tracing, and the fair allocation of vaccines globally. Yet, the most significant ethical challenge that the world must address in the next year and beyond is to ensure that we learn the ethical lessons of the first year of this pandemic. Learning from our collective experiences thus far constitutes our greatest moral obligation. Appreciating that decision-making in the context of a pandemic is constrained by unprecedented complexity and uncertainty, beginning in June 2020, an international group of 17 experts in bioethics spanning 15 countries (including low-, middle-, and high-income countries) met virtually to identify what we considered to be the most significant ethical challenges and accompanying lessons faced thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic. Once collected, the group met over the course of several virtual meetings to identify challenges and lessons that are analytically distinct in order to identify common ethical themes under which different challenges and lessons could be grouped. The result, described in this paper, is what this expert group consider to be the top five ethical lessons from the initial experience with COVID-19 that must be learned.	false
0	Lesson of the month: Severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): a diagnostic challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the case of a 71-year-old woman with bilateral pneumonia who continued to deteriorate despite multiple courses of antibiotics. When dexamethasone was added to cover the possibility of COVID-19 pneumonia, she rapidly improved. Subsequently, she was found to have a strongly positive PR3 anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and clinical features consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) with upper respiratory tract and renal involvement. The case highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic can create new challenges in the diagnosis of GPA. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2021. All rights reserved.	false
0	Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infections in Geriatric Hospitalized Patients before and after the COVID-19 Outbreak: Results from a Retrospective Observational Study in Two Geriatric Wards. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess prevalence, etiology, and association with mortality of MDR bacteria in older adult patients before and after the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. An observational retrospective study was conducted in two geriatric wards of the Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedali Riuniti Marche Nord, Fano, and of the INRCA, IRCCS, Ancona, in the Marche Region, Italy, from December 2019 to February 2020 and from May to July 2020. A total of 73 patients (mean age 87.4 +/- 5.9, 27.4% men) and 83 cultures (36 pre-COVID-19 and 47 post-COVID-19) were considered. Overall, 46 cultures (55.4%) reported MDR bacteria (50% in pre- and 59.6% in post-COVID-19 period, p = 0.384). MDR bacteria in bloodstream significantly increased in post-COVID-19 period (68.8% vs. 40.0% p = 0.038) and MDR bacteria in urine did not change (51.6 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.799). Escherichia coli was the main MDR bacterium in pre-COVID-19, p = 0.082 and post-COVID-19, p = 0.026. Among patients with MDR infection, in-hospital mortality was 37.5% and 68.8% in pre- and post-COVID-19, respectively (p = 0.104), and mortality at 30 days was higher in post-COVID-19 period (78.9% vs. 27.3%, p = 0.012). An increased number of MDR bacteria in bloodstream and mortality after MDR infection have been observed in the post-COVID-19 period.	false
0	Risk of Coronavirus Disease Incidence, Severe Presentation, and Mortality in Patients with Lung Cancer. Purpose: This study aimed to analyze whether patients with lung cancer have a higher incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), severe presentation, and higher mortality than those without lung cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): A nationwide cohort of confirmed COVID-19 (n=8,070) between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121,050) were constructed. A nested case-control study to compare the proportion of patients with lung cancer between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Result(s): The proportion of patients with lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (0.5% [37/8,070]) than in the matched cohort (0.3% [325/121,050]) (p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of having lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-2.10). Among patients in the COVID-19 cohort, compared to patients without lung cancer, those with lung cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 (54.1% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.01), including mortality (18.5% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01). The adjusted OR for the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer was 2.24 (95% CI = 1.08-4.74). Conclusion(s): The risk of COVID-19 incidence and severe presentation, including mortality, may be higher in patients with lung cancer than in those without lung cancer.	false
0	Poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with severe asthma on biologic therapy. Background: It is unclear whether asthma and asthma medications increase or decrease the risk of severe COVID-19, and this is particularly true for patients with severe asthma receiving biologics. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to assess incidence and disease course of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma on biologic therapy (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab), as compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population. Method(s): COVID-19 cases were identified through a prospective ongoing survey between March 17 and April 30, 2020 among all severe asthma specialists from 15 hospitals of the Dutch Severe Asthma Registry RAPSODI. From these cases, data was collected on patient characteristics, including co-morbidities, COVID-19 disease progression and asthma exacerbations. Findings were then compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population. Result(s): Of 634 severe asthma patients who received biologic therapy in RAPSODI, 9 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Seven patients (1.1%) required hospitalization for oxygen therapy, of which 5 were admitted to the intensive care for intubation and mechanical ventilation. One patient died (0.16%). All intubated patients had >=1 co-morbidities. Odds (95%CI) for COVID-19 related hospitalization and intubations were 14 (6.6-29.5) and 41 (16.9-98.5) times higher, respectively, compared to the Dutch population. One patient presented with an asthma exacerbation. Conclusion(s): Patients with severe asthma using biologic therapy showed to have a more severe course of COVID-19 compared to the general population. This may be due to co-morbidities, the severity of asthmatic airway inflammation, the use of biologics, or a combination of these.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Nonadministration of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is less common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is higher than most other hospitalized patients. Nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is common and is associated with VTE events. Our objective was to determine whether nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is more common in patients with COVID-19 versus other hospitalized patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients discharged from the Johns hopkins hospital between Mar 1 and May 12, 2020, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, VTE outcomes, prescription and administration of VTE prophylaxis between COVID-19 positive, negative, and not tested groups., RESULTS: Patients tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly older, and more likely to be Hispanic, have a higher median body mass index, have longer hospital length of stay, require mechanical ventilation, develop pulmonary embolism and die (all p < 0.001). COVID-19 patients were more likely to be prescribed (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.38-1.66) and receive all doses of prescribed pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.62). The number of patients who missed at least one dose of VTE prophylaxis and developed VTE was similar between the three groups (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that high rates of VTE in COVID-19 are due to nonadministration of doses of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Hence, we should prioritize research into alternative approaches to optimizing VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Injury to the endothelial glycocalyx in critically ill Covid-19 patients. Introduction: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect the endothelium leading to microvascular endothelialitis. The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) plays an essential role in maintaining endothelial function. Objective(s): To investigate if injury to the eGC can be found in critical ill Covid-19 patients Methods: Sublingual assessment of the eGC via sublingual dark field imaging was performed in 19 critically ill Covid-19 patients within 24h after intubation and in 10 controls. Blood samples were analyzed for markers of endothelial and eGC injury. A 3D microfluidic flow assay was performed to examine eGC ex vivo in naive and Heparanase-2 overexpressing endothelial cells (ECs). Result(s): In Covid-19 patients, transmembrane proteins such as Syndecan- 1 and sTie2 were increased in the circulation indicting pathological shedding. Hpa-1, a key regulator of eGC, and its enzymatic activity were unchanged. In contrast, its protective counterpart Hpa-2 was profoundly reduced (median (IQR) 18.7 (10.6-31.1) U/ml vs. 4.7 (2.6-5.6) U/ml, p = 0.014). Ex vivo stimulation of ECs with serum from Covid-19 patients was sufficient to lower Hpa-2 transcription and to induce glycocalyx damage that could be rescued by lentiviral Hpa-2 overexpression. Consistently, in vivo imaging of the eGC revealed a reduced thickness (increased perfused boundary region (PBR) 1.9 (1.8-1.9) mum vs. 2.1 (1.8-2.2)mum, p = 0.009) in Covid-19. Conclusion(s): In critically ill patients with Covid-19, early endothelial injury involves the integrity of the glycocalyx. Acquired Hpa-2 deficiency might be a potentially causative factor. These observations may trigger novel therapeutic interventions aiming at protecting endothelial function.	false
0	The impact of ethnicity and gender on outcome in patients admitted to intensive care for management of COVID-19. Introduction: Northwick Park Hospital supplies a diverse population of at least 40% black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (BAME). During the COVID19 pandemic, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experienced an unprecedented demand for beds, leading to the declaration of a critical incident on 19th March demanding a rapid expansion and restructure. Recent analyses of COVID19 transmission and susceptibility have shown that the BAME population is disproportionately affected by both a high infection rate and increased mortality from COVID19. These inferences have been attributed to both socioeconomic disparity and occupational hazard. Similarly, an association has been found between the male sex and the severity of COVID19 infection. This study investigates these associations. The large sample size provided within a single clinical setting provides valuable insights into BAME disparity in order to optimise future treatment of COVID19. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of all the patients admitted to ICU at NWP with COVID19 between 01/03/2020 and 31/05/2020. Data were collected from patient notes, local histopathology databases and the ICNARC database. These included baseline characteristics (ethnicity, date of birth, sex and comorbidities), baseline P/F ratio (PaO2/FiO2), organ support requirements and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed in R. We used logistic regression to determine predictors of mortality and differences between BAME and white patients. Result(s): 264 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID19, of which 83.3% of these identified as BAME. 80.3% of patients were male. Stepwise regression showed that increasing age, and male sex, were the significant predictors of low P/F at admission. Logistic regression analyses showed that pre-morbid state (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.22-2.32), BAME (OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.77-17.70) and age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were significantly associated with requiring haemodialysis, but as expected, only P/F on admission was significantly associated with likelihood of intubation (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99). Regression analyses on admission parameters demonstrated that age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08), pre-morbid state (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.05), and low PF (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99) were significantly associated with death. Adjusting regression for intra-ICU parameters showed that age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) and haemodialysis (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.67-5.44) were the statistically significant predictors of death. Ethnicity was not associated with mortality in the ICU. Conclusion(s): While BAME patients are over-represented in ICU admissions for COVID19, the BAME population had parity in severity of ARDS on admission and mortality. Pulmonary capacity at admission was negatively affected by being male and by increasing age, in keeping with national and international data. Being of BAME ethnicity was significantly associated with haemodialysis requirement on ICU, which is something to be considered during a second wave of the pandemic.	false
0	Differential effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on patients presenting to a neurological emergency room depending on their triage score in an area with low COVID-19 incidence. Background: We analyzed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on neurologic emergencies, depending on the patients' triage score in a setting with relatively few COVID-19 cases and without lack of resources. Method(s): Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with a dedicated neurologic emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17, 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke, and the quality of stroke care. Result(s): A total of 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median [interquartile range] per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p = 0.015). The median numbers of patients per week with triage 1 (emergent) and 4 (non-urgent) were comparable (51 [43-58] vs. 59 [54-62]; p = 0.132, and 10 [4-16] vs. 16 [7-18]; p = 0.310, respectively).The median number of patients per week declined in categories 2 and 3 in 2020 (41 [37-45] vs. 57 [52-61]; p = 0.004, and 28 [23-35] vs. 61 [52-63]; p = 0.002, respectively. No change was observed in the absolute number of strokes (138 in 2019 and 141 in 2020). Quality metrics of stroke revascularization therapies (symptom-to-door time, door-to-needle time or relative number of therapies) and stroke severity remained constant. Conclusion(s): During the lockdown period in 2020, the number of patients with emergent symptoms remained constant, while fewer patients with urgent symptoms presented to the nER. This may imply behavioral changes in care-seeking behavior.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The Impact of Halting Elective Admissions in Anticipation of a Demand Surge Due to the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: In anticipation of a demand surge for hospital beds attributed to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) many US states have mandated that hospitals postpone elective admissions. OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate excess demand for hospital beds due to COVID-19, the net financial impact of eliminating elective admissions in order to meet demand, and to explore the scenario when demand remains below capacity. RESEARCH DESIGN: An economic simulation to estimate the net financial impact of halting elective admissions, combining epidemiological reports, the US Census, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the National Inpatient Sample. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored the results while varying assumptions for demand and capacity. SUBJECTS: Inputs regarding disease prevalence and inpatient utilization were representative of the US population. Our base case relied on a hospital admission rate reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 137.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (378.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (207.4 per 100,000). On average, elective admissions accounted for 20% of total hospital admissions, and the average rate of unoccupied beds across hospitals was 30%. MEASURES: Net financial impact of halting elective admissions. RESULT(S): On average, hospitals COVID-19 demand for hospital bed-days fell well short of hospital capacity, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net financial impact of a 90-day COVID surge on a hospital was only favorable under a narrow circumstance when capacity was filled by a high proportion of COVID-19 cases among hospitals with low rates of elective admissions. CONCLUSION(S): Hospitals that restricted elective care took on a substantial financial risk, potentially threatening viability. A sustainable public policy should therefore consider support to hospitals that responsibly served their communities through the crisis.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Development of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in a relapsing multiple sclerosis patient on ofatumumab. We report the case of a MS patient on subcutaneous ofatumumab who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remained asymptomatic while developing antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies. The patient was B-cell depleted with normal serum immunoglobulin levels. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies remained positive three months after the initial infection. These findings suggest that a MS patient treated with ofatumumab may be able to mount an effective humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and probably to COVID-19 vaccines as well. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the humoral response of MS patients on ofatumumab to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

0	Early Acceleration of COVID-19 in Areas with Larger Nursing Homes and Certificate of Need Laws. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have become common in large nursing homes, placing not only residents but also staff and community members at risk for infection. However, the relationship between larger nursing homes and the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented., OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between county average nursing home bed size and presence of certificate of need (CON) laws, which influence nursing home size, with county-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using county-level data from March 11 through June 12, 2020., PARTICIPANTS: All US counties with at least one nursing home (n = 2,883)., MAIN MEASURES: The main explanatory variables were county average nursing home bed size and presence of a CON law. The main outcome was the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases on each day of the study period adjusted for county population size and density, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, total nursing home bed supply, other health care supply measures, epidemic stage, and census region., KEY RESULTS: By June 12, a between-county difference in average nursing home size equal to 1 bed was associated with 3.92 additional SARS-COV-2 cases (95% CI = 2.14 to 5.69; P < 0.001), on average, and counties subject to CON laws had 104.53 additional SARS-CoV-2 cases (95% CI = 7.68 to 201.38; P < 0.05), on average. Counties with larger nursing homes also demonstrated higher growth in the frequency of SARS-COV-2 throughout the study period., CONCLUSIONS: At the county level, average nursing home size and CON law presence was associated with a greater frequency of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Controlling the impact of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic may require additional resources for communities with larger nursing homes and more attention towards long-term care policies.	false
0	Home quarantine in COVID-19: A study on 50 consecutive patients in Austria. A cohort of the first 50 COVID-19 patients in East Tyrol, a region in the southwest of Austria, were monitored in home quarantine. Specific viral ribonucleic acid was detected in throat swabs and stool samples. Analysis indicated a median virus shedding duration of 13 days; however, statistical outliers highlight the importance of consequent testing. This underlines the need of negative throat swabs prior to removing quarantine. We monitored the disease's characteristics via an in-house score called Corona Severity Index, in order to predict an aggravation of the disease. Special attention was paid to early symptoms, such as headache, which appeared to be significantly more common in younger patients (p=0.019). Anosmia and ageusia showed a predominance in female patients (p=0.028). Investigation revealed seven relapses and viral shedding fluctuation in four cases. A follow-up examination shed light on seroconversion which could be observed in 35 of 40 participants. This further clarifies the necessity of establishing discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2021. All rights reserved.	false
0	Early induction of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associates with rapid viral clearance and mild disease in COVID-19 patients. Virus-specific humoral and cellular immunity act synergistically to protect the host from viral infection. We interrogate the dynamic changes of virological and immunological parameters in 12 patients with symptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from disease onset to convalescence or death. We quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the respiratory tract in parallel with antibodies and circulating T cells specific for various structural (nucleoprotein [NP], membrane [M], ORF3a, and spike) and non-structural (ORF7/8, NSP7, and NSP13) proteins. Although rapid induction and quantity of humoral responses associate with an increase in disease severity, early induction of interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is present in patients with mild disease and accelerated viral clearance. These findings provide support for the prognostic value of early functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with important implications in vaccine design and immune monitoring.

0	No SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. INTRODUCTION: Convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT), a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), requires strict quality control of the donor blood. Whether to confirm the disappearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (RNAemia) in convalescent donor blood or not is unclear. Reports recommending the proof of viral disappearance from the blood are controversial. Foreseeing CPT in treating COVID-19 patients in Japan, we investigated RNAemia in 100 convalescent donors with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19., METHODS: Between April 30 and July 30, 2020, we measured RNAemia in the plasma samples of donors with resolved COVID-19. Data on patients' demographics, comorbidities, pneumonia, treatment, and real-time polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2 were collected. Date of onset of initial symptoms or date of positive testing (for asymptomatic patients) were self-reported by the patients. Disease severity was defined as: no, mild, moderate oxygen demand, or severe (requiring mechanical ventilation)., RESULTS: Of 100 donors (58 males [58.0%]; median age, 47 [range 22-69] years) screened as of July 30, 2020, 77 (77.0%); 19 (19.0%); and 4 (4.0%) had mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Median time between onset and testing was 68.5 (range, 21-167) days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the plasma samples., CONCLUSION: RNAemia was not found in recovered COVID-19 patients at least 21, 27, and 57 days after the onset of mild, moderate, and severe symptoms. Our study may contribute to determining a suitable time for collecting convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients and to future CPT use.

0	CD8+ T cell immunogenicity induced by endogenous EVs engineered by antigens fused to a truncated Nefmut EV-anchoring protein. Intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing the extracellular vesicle (EV) anchoring protein Nefmut fused at its C terminus to viral and tumor antigens elicits a potent, effective, and anti tolerogenic CD8+ T cell immunity against the heterologous antigen. The immune response is induced through the production of EVs incorporating Nefmut derivatives released by muscle cells. In the perspective to a possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety profile by identifying the minimal part of Nefmut retaining the EV anchoring protein property. We found that a C terminal deletion of 29 amino acids did not affect the ability of Nefmut to associate with EVs. Furthermore, the EV-anchoring function was preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i.e., E6 and E7) and SARSCoV2 (i.e., S1 and S2) were fused to its C terminus. By analyzing the immune responses induced after intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing fusion products based on the four viral antigens, we found that the Nefmut C terminal deletion did not impact on the levels of antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocytes as evaluated by IFN-γ EliSpot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. In addition, immune responses at distal sites remained unaffected, as indicated by the similar percentages of SARS CoV 2 S1 and S2 specific CD8+ T cells detected in spleens and lung airways of mice injected with DNA vectors expressing the viral antigens fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL. We concluded that the C terminal Nefmut truncation does not affect stability, EV anchoring, and CD8+ T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen. Hence, NefmutPL represents a safer alternative to full length Nefmut for the design of CD8+ T cell vaccines for humans.	false
0	Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA concentrations in nasopharyngeal samples from children and adults using an ultrasensitive and quantitative antigen assay. Background: Diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR offers high sensitivity, but the utility of detecting samples with high cycle threshold (Ct) values remains controversial. Currently available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens (Ag) have sensitivity well below PCR. The correlation of Ag and RNA quantities in clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) samples is unknown. Method(s): An ultrasensitive, quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (the MSD S-PLEX CoV-2 N assay) was used to measure Ag in clinical NP samples from adults and children previously tested by PCR. Result(s): The S-PLEX Ag assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.16 pg/mL and a cutoff of 0.32 pg/mL. Ag concentrations measured in clinical NP samples (collected in 3.0 mL media) ranged from less than 160 fg/mL to 2.7 ug/mL. Log-transformed Ag concentrations correlated tightly with Ct values. In 35 adult and 101 pediatric PCR-positive samples, sensitivity was 91% (95% CI, 77-98%) and 79% (70-87%), respectively. In samples with Ct <= 35, sensitivity was 100% (88-100%) and 96% (88-99%), respectively. In 50 adult and 40 pediatric PCR-negative specimens, specificity was 100% (93-100%) and 98% (87-100%), respectively. Conclusion(s): Nucleocapsid concentrations in clinical NP samples span 8 orders of magnitude and correlate closely with RNA concentrations (Ct values). The S-PLEX Ag assay had 96-100% sensitivity in samples from children and adults with Ct values <= 35, and 98-100% specificity. These results clarify Ag concentration distributions in clinical samples, providing insight into the performance of Ag RDTs and offering a new approach to diagnosis of COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and antibiotics treatment in suspected bacterial infection patients with COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought challenges to health and social care systems. However, the empirical use of antibiotics is still confusing. Presently, a total of 1123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was included in this retrospective cohort study. The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group. Moreover, penicillin and meropenem treatments were associated with increased mortality of the patients with no evidence of bacterial infection. In conclusion, patients with suspected bacterial infection were more likely to have negative clinical outcomes than those without bacterial infection. Empirical use of antibiotics may not have the expected benefits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Effect of anakinra versus usual care in adults in hospital with COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate pneumonia (CORIMUNO-ANA-1): a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have an excess of inflammation and increased concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1). We aimed to determine whether anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, could improve outcomes in patients in hospital with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia., METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, Bayesian randomised clinical trial (CORIMUNO-ANA-1), nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort, we recruited patients from 16 University hospitals in France with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen by mask or nasal cannula but without ventilation assistance, a score of 5 on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS), and a C-reactive protein serum concentration of more than 25 mg/L not requiring admission to the intensive care unit at admission to hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based secure centralised system, stratified by centre and blocked with varying block sizes (randomly of size two or four), to either usual care plus anakinra (200 mg twice a day on days 1-3, 100 mg twice on day 4, 100 mg once on day 5) or usual care alone. Usual care was provided at the discretion of the site clinicians. The two coprimary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had died or needed non-invasive or mechanical ventilation by day 4 (ie, a score of >5 on the WHO-CPS) and survival without need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen) at day 14. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341584, and is now closed to accrual., FINDINGS: Between April 8 and April 26, 2020, we screened 153 patients. The study was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, after the recruitment of 116 patients: 59 were assigned to the anakinra group, and 57 were assigned to the usual care group. Two patients in the usual care group withdrew consent and were not analysed. In the analysable population, the median age was 66 years (IQR 59 to 76) and 80 (70%) participants were men. In the anakinra group, 21 (36%) of 59 patients had a WHO-CPS score of more than 5 at day 4 versus 21 (38%) of 55 in the usual care group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -2.5%, 90% credible interval [CrI] -17.1 to 12.0), with a posterior probability of ARD of less than 0 (ie, anakinra better than usual care) of 61.2%. At day 14, 28 (47%; 95% CI 33 to 59) patients in the anakinra group and 28 (51%; 95% CI 36 to 62) in the usual care group needed ventilation or died, with a posterior probability of any efficacy of anakinra (hazard ratio [HR] being less than 1) of 54.5% (median posterior HR 0.97; 90% CrI 0.62 to 1.52). At day 90, 16 (27%) patients in the anakinra group and 15 (27%) in the usual care group had died. Serious adverse events occurred in 27 (46%) patients in the anakinra group and 21 (38%) in the usual care group (p=0.45)., INTERPRETATION: Anakinra did not improve outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of anakinra in other selected groups of patients with more severe COVID-19., FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique, Foundation for Medical Research, and AP-HP Foundation.

0	Repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing after recovery. Is a pre-transplant PCR necessary?. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical syndrome of COVID19 resulted in a major decrease in transplant volumes during the first months of the pandemic followed by a change in practice, with strict screening and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing prior to transplant. Protocols required a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR prior to proceeding with transplantation. Many transplants were delayed nationwide due to persistent positive PCRs in asymptomatic patients, sometimes for months (1). Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	The Adrenal Cortex, an Underestimated Site of SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Background: The majority of the critically ill patients may have critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). The therapeutic effect of dexamethasone may be related to its ability to improve cortical function. Recent study showed that dexamethasone can reduce COVID-19 deaths by up to one third in critically ill patients. The aim of this article is to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can attack the adrenal cortex to aggravate the relative adrenal insufficiency., Methods: We summarized the clinical features of COVID-19 reported in currently available observational studies. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was examined in human adrenal glands by immunohistochemical staining. We retrospectively analyzed serum cortisol levels in critically ill patients with or without COVID-19., Results: High percentage of critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection in the study were treated with vasopressors. ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 serine protease were colocalized in adrenocortical cells in zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. We collected plasma cortisol concentrations in nine critically ill patients with COVID-19. The cortisol levels of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were lower than those in non-COVID-19 critically ill group. Six of the nine COVID-19 critically ill patients had random plasma cortisol concentrations below 10 microg/dl, which met the criteria for the diagnosis of CIRCI., Conclusion: We demonstrate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized in adrenocortical cells, and that the cortisol levels are lower in critically ill patients with COVID-19 as compared to those of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Based on our findings, we recommend measuring plasma cortisol level to guide hormonal therapy. Copyright © 2021 Mao, Xu, Guan, Xu, Li, Ren, Zhu, Gao and Jiang.	false
0	Altered high-density lipoprotein composition and functions during severe COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting millions of patients worldwide. The consequences of initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2 go beyond pulmonary damage, with a particular impact on lipid metabolism. Decreased levels in HDL-C were reported in COVID-19 patients. Since HDL particles display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and potential anti-infectious properties, we aimed at characterizing HDL proteome and functionality during COVID-19 relative to healthy subjects. HDLs were isolated from plasma of 8 severe COVID-19 patients sampled at admission to intensive care unit (Day 1, D1) at D3 and D7, and from 16 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. Proteomic analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS. The relative amounts of proteins identified in HDLs were compared between COVID-19 and controls. apolipoprotein A-I and paraoxonase 1 were confirmed by Western-blot analysis to be less abundant in COVID-19 versus controls, whereas serum amyloid A and alpha-1 antitrypsin were higher. HDLs from patients were less protective in endothelial cells stiumalted by TNFalpha (permeability, VE-cadherin disorganization and apoptosis). In these conditions, HDL inhibition of apoptosis was blunted in COVID-19 relative to controls. In conclusion, we show major changes in HDL proteome and decreased functionality in severe COVID-19 patients.	false

0	COVID-TRACK: world and USA SARS-COV-2 testing and COVID-19 tracking. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major health and socio-economic disruptions worldwide. Accurate investigation of emerging data is crucial to inform policy makers as they construct viral mitigation strategies. Complications such as variable testing rates and time lags in counting cases, hospitalizations and deaths make it challenging to accurately track and identify true infectious surges from available data, and requires a multi-modal approach that simultaneously considers testing, incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. Although many websites and applications report a subset of these data, none of them provide graphical displays capable of comparing different states or countries on all these measures as well as various useful quantities derived from them. Here we introduce a freely available dynamic representation tool, COVID-TRACK, that allows the user to simultaneously assess time trends in these measures and compare various states or countries, equipping them with a tool to investigate the potential effects of the different mitigation strategies and timelines used by various jurisdictions. Finding(s): COVID-TRACK is a Python based web-application that provides a platform for tracking testing, incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths related to COVID-19 along with various derived quantities. Our application makes the comparison across states in the USA and countries in the world easy to explore, with useful transformation options including per capita, log scale, and/or moving averages. We illustrate its use by assessing various viral trends in the USA and Europe. Conclusion(s): The COVID-TRACK web-application is a user-friendly analytical tool to compare data and trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic across areas in the United States and worldwide. Our tracking tool provides a unique platform where trends can be monitored across geographical areas in the coming months to watch how the pandemic waxes and wanes over time at different locations around the USA and the globe.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false
0	Searching for a role of procalcitonin determination in COVID-19: A study on a selected cohort of hospitalized patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed for differentiating viral vs. bacterial infections. In COVID-19, some preliminary results have shown that PCT testing could act as a predictor of bacterial co-infection and be a useful marker for assessment of disease severity. We studied 83 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in whom PCT was specifically ordered by attending physicians. PCT results were evaluated according to the ability to accurately predict bacterial co-infections and death in comparison with other known biomarkers of infection and with major laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity. Thirty-three (39.8%) patients suffered an in-hospital bacterial co-infection and 44 (53.0%) patients died. In predicting bacterial co-infection, PCT showed a relatively low accuracy (area under receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC]: 0.757; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.651-0.845), with a strength for detecting the outcome not significantly different from that of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). In predicting patient death, PCT showed an AUC of 0.815 (CI: 0.714-0.892), not better than those of other more common laboratory tests, such as blood lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.874, p=0.19), serum lactate dehydrogenase (AUC: 0.860, p=0.47), blood neutrophil count (AUC: 0.845, p=0.59), and serum albumin (AUC: 0.839, p=0.73). Procalcitonin (PCT) testing, even when appropriately ordered, did not provide a significant added value in COVID-19 patients when compared with more consolidated biomarkers of infection and poor clinical outcome. The major application of PCT in COVID-19 is its ability, associated with a negative predictive value >90%, to exclude a bacterial co-infection when a rule-out cut-off (<0.25 mug/L) is applied.

0	REGN-COV2, a neutralizing antibody cocktail, in outpatients with Covid-19. BACKGROUND Recent data suggest that complications and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may be related to high viral loads. METHODS In this ongoing, double-blind, phase 1-3 trial involving nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19, we investigated two fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, used in a combined cocktail (REGN-COV2) to reduce the risk of the emergence of treatment-resistant mutant virus. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 2.4 g of REGN-COV2, or 8.0 g of REGN-COV2 and were prospectively characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive or serum antibody-negative). Key end points included the time-weighted average change in viral load from baseline (day 1) through day 7 and the percentage of patients with at least one Covid-19-related medically attended visit through day 29. Safety was assessed in all patients. RESULTS Data from 275 patients are reported. The least-squares mean difference (combined REGN-COV2 dose groups vs. placebo group) in the time-weighted average change in viral load from day 1 through day 7 was-0.56 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI],-1.02 to-0.11) among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline and-0.41 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI,-0.71 to-0.10) in the overall trial population. In the overall trial population, 6% of the patients in the placebo group and 3% of the patients in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups reported at least one medically attended visit; among patients who were serum antibody-negative at baseline, the corresponding percentages were 15% and 6% (difference,-9 percentage points; 95% CI,-29 to 11). The percentages of patients with hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and other adverse events were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS In this interim analysis, the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, with a greater effect in patients whose immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load at baseline. Safety outcomes were similar in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups and the placebo group. Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.	false
0	Increased Colonic Expression of ACE2 Associates with Poor Prognosis in Crohn’s Disease. <h4>Background: </h4> and Aims: The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is highly expressed in small intestine. Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course. <h4>Methods: </h4> We examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients. <h4>Results: </h4>: Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18; 95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Increased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients. These data point to the need for molecular stratification that may impact CD disease-related outcomes.	false
0	Epidemiological and evolutionary considerations of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dosing regimes. As the threat of Covid-19 continues and in the face of vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels. How timing of delivery of the second dose affects infection burden but also prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape are critical questions. Both hinge on the strength and duration (i.e. robustness) of the immune response elicited by a single dose, compared to natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short-term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection, evaluating how different second dose delays might drive immune escape via a build-up of partially immune individuals. Under certain scenarios, we find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose, and to ramp up vaccination efforts throughout the world.	false
0	COVID-19 intervention models: An initial aggressive treatment strategy for controlling the infection. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in December 2019. The disease has caused loss of many lives and has become an unprecedented threat to public health worldwide. We develop simple COVID-19 epidemic models to study treatment strategies to control the pandemic. The results show that eradication of the disease is possible if the efficacy of treatment is perfect. We also investigate the existence of a dual-rate effect. Conditions under which the effect occurs are derived. When the effect is present, a tactic to control the infection might be to initially treat infected individuals aggressively at a relatively high rate to drive the prevalence to a lower region that can be maintained in the long run at relatively moderate rate and cost.

0	The E484K mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reduces but does not abolish neutralizing activity of human convalescent and post-vaccination sera. One year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the first vaccines are being rolled out under emergency use authorizations. It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples, with low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However, human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals with a primer vaccination. Our data suggests that this may leave vaccinees less protected against newly emerging variants.	false
0	Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62 354 COVID-19 cases in the USA. Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62 354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. Method(s): We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69.8 million patients. TriNetX included 62 354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. Finding(s): In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.5 vs influenza; 1.7, 1.5-1.9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1.6, 1.4-1.9 vs skin infection; 1.6, 1.3-1.9 vs cholelithiasis; 2.2, 1.9-2.6 vs urolithiasis, and 2.1, 1.9-2.5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18.1% (95% CI 17.6-18.6), including 5.8% (5.2-6.4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1.6% (95% CI 1.2-2.1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI 1.59-1.71; p<0.0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. Interpretation(s): Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

0	Laryngotracheal stenosis following intubation and tracheostomy for COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report. Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is a rare but serious condition characterized by narrowing of the airway. Iatrogenic injury from endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy insertion is the most common cause of LTS. We present the first reported experience of managing a patient diagnosed with subglottic stenosis (a subtype of LTS) following previous intubation and tracheostomy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This patient required an urgent surgical tracheostomy and subsequent referral to a tertiary airway surgery unit for definitive treatment, which included microlaryngoscopy, laser excision and balloon dilatation. This case highlights that LTS should be included in the differential diagnosis for patients re-presenting with breathing difficulties after prolonged intubation or tracheostomy for COVID-19. Furthermore, it raises the concern of a rise in the incidence of this condition and an increased burden on the few units specializing in airway surgery.

0	An Incidental Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia With Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The most common clinical findings related to COVID-19 are fever and cough, with the proportion of patients developing interstitial pneumonia. Other symptoms include dyspnea, expectoration, headache, anosmia, ageusia, myalgia and malaise. To date, the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 include nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax showing signs of interstitial pneumonia are important in the management of respiratory disease and in the evaluation of lung involvement. In the literature, there are few cases of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In our report, we describe a case of accidental detection of findings related to interstitial pneumonia in a patient who underwent abdominal MRI for other clinical reasons. A 71-year-old woman was referred to our department for an MRI scan of the abdomen as her oncological follow-up. She was asymptomatic at the time of the examination and had passed the triage carried out on all the patients prior to diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. The images acquired in the upper abdomen showed the presence of areas of altered signal intensity involving asymmetrically both pulmonary lower lobes, with a patchy appearance and a preferential peripheral subpleural distribution. We considered these features as highly suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia. The nasopharyngeal swab later confirmed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are limited reports about MRI features of COVID-19 pneumonia, considering that high-resolution chest CT is the imaging technique of choice to diagnose pneumonia. Nevertheless, this clinical case confirmed that it is possible to detect MRI signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. The imaging features described could help in the evaluation of the lung parenchyma to assess the presence of signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in asymptomatic patients during the pandemic phase of the disease.

0	Biospecimen collection during the covid-19 pandemic considerations for biobanking. Objectives: Millions of biospecimens will be collected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As learned from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), proper biospecimen handling is necessary to prevent laboratoryrelated infections. Method(s): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. Conclusion(s): All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon, it will be imperative to convene expert working groups to address the current and long-term storage and use of these biospecimens. Ideally, worldwide guidelines will be established to protect the personnel handling these biospecimens and communities at large.Copyright © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.	false
0	Intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: In December 2019, the first cases of respiratory pathology (COVID-19) caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in Wuhan. Since then, COVID-19 has spread exponentially throughout the world, having been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the WHO has officially declared the COVID-19 pandemic. In our country the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on March 2, with causalities starting on March 18. The differences between countries or different Intensive Care Units (ICU) are still under investigation for the disparities in regional admissions and the severity of illness. This illustrates how natural evolution of COVID-19 and its prognosis are still not fully understood. Conscient that there is an important impact of public health restriction and confinement in local evolution and transmission, there is relevancy in mentioning that National Emergency State was declared on March 18, and a national calamity on May 3, resulting in closure of not essential public stores. There was an adjustment of our ICU organization, with the creation of a separate cohort, named COVID ICU exclusively dedicated to these patients. Objective(s): Characterization of the population of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 admitted to Intensive Care Unit at a university affiliated hospital, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of a district hospital experience during an outbreak (from preparation to the results). Method(s): This is a retrospective and descriptive study that includes only data from the usual clinical practice. All positive COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 2, 2020 to June 26 were included. Patients were followed from admission to discharge from the ICU. Result(s): Over the last 3 months, coincidentally with the national spike and the so-called 'first wave' of cases, there was an adjustment of the ICU organization, with the creation of a separate cohort exclusively dedicated to this patients. With a total of 169 patients admitted to our hospital, we had 13 admissions (12 patients, but one readmitted). The mean age of the patients was 74 years, and 66.6% were men. Of the 12 patients, 2 had no symptoms but had known risk contact and presented with silent hypoxemia. Length of stay varied from 1 to 25 days. Laboratory results showed the usual highly elevated c-reactive Protein levels and lactate dehydrogenase. At admission, patients had a mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 169, with a minimum of 52. Five had mechanical ventilation since the admission with an average of 14 days of ventilation. Patients who developed an ARDS (5 patients) were treated according to the recommendations. All patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine following the recommendations in force until the hospitalization. Four of the 12 patients didn't survive (33.3%). Conclusion(s): The pandemic has tested public health measures as the functioning and responsiveness of health services worldwide. The ICUs, in the role of manager of the critical patient, have a particularly important role in the approach of these patients considering the risk of flooding ICU during outbursts, and the consciousness that intensive care support is crucial for the surviving of severe cases. The lack of knowledge and the limit of resources are factors of added difficulty in the approach of patients with COVID-19. The variability between centers is still not understood. The lack of evidence has originated different strategies around the world.	false
0	Respiratory and Psychophysical Sequelae Among Patients With COVID-19 Four Months After Hospital Discharge. Importance: Although plenty of data exist regarding clinical manifestations, course, case fatality rate, and risk factors associated with mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), long-term respiratory and functional sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 are unknown., Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 4 months after discharge., Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results., Exposure: Severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as Dlco <60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with Dlco reduction and psychological or functional sequelae., Results: Among 767 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 494 (64.4%) refused to participate, and 35 (4.6%) died during follow-up. A total of 238 patients (31.0%) (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-71] years; 142 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] comorbidities, 2 [1-3]) consented to participate to the study. Of these, 219 patients were able to complete both pulmonary function tests and Dlco measurement. Dlco was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score <11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for age and sex in 75 patients (40.5%); thus, a total of 128 patients (53.8%) had functional impairment. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were reported in a total of 41 patients (17.2%)., Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that at 4 months after discharge, respiratory, physical, and psychological sequelae were common among patients who had been hospitalized for COVID-19.	false
0	Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis in association with covid-19. Background: Since the beginning of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several neurological associations have been described in literature including Transverse Myelitis. Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis (LETM) is largely known in association with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) but can be seen with many other inflammatory, infectious, malignant and metabolic causes. Objective(s): We hereby report our experience with 3 patients who suffered from LETM preceded by COVID-19 infection. The clinical presentation and outcome as well as the laboratory data is being discussed. Method(s): We collected the data from 3 patients who were diagnosed to have COVID-related LETM between the period from March 2020 to July 2020. We describe the clinical and laboratory data of these patienst in detail. Result(s): There were 3 patients seen from March 2020 to July 2020 who suffered from COVID-19 related post-infectious LETM. They were males from different backgrounds with age ranging from 32 to 52 years. Two of them presented with sensory symptoms and unstable gait, other presented with pure motor syndrome. We investigated the patients for other possible infectious/ autoimmune etiologies in detail. All had positive COVID-19 PCR and developed myelitis-related symptoms in variable phase of post-infective period, ranging from 4 days to 4 weeks. NMO- antibodies were absent in all. Associated lab investigations revealed positive Lupus anticoagulant and low Protein S in one patent who developed myelitis within first week of infection and subsequently developed pulmonary embolism. Two patients had CSF results which showed slight increments in protein and leukocytes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging results long segment involvement of cervical and dorsal at different levels, with variable contrast enhancement. One had concomitant involvement of brain. They were all treated as acute post-infectious myelitis as per the general consensus with IV pulse steroid therapy, Methylprednisolone 1 gm daily for 5 days. All showed remarkable recovery and were discharged with minimal neurological symptoms, if at all. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that despite being a potential cause of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, COVID-19 carries a good prognosis if treated in time, with pulse steroid therapy as in our case.	false
0	Incidence and Outcomes of COVID-19 in Kidney and Liver Transplant Recipients With HIV: Report From the National HOPE in Action Consortium. BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients with HIV may have worse outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to impaired T-cell function coupled with immunosuppressive drugs. Alternatively, immunosuppression might reduce inflammatory complications and/or antiretrovirals could be protective. METHOD(S): Prospective reporting of all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection was required within the HOPE in Action Multicenter Consortium, a cohort of kidney and liver transplant recipients with HIV who have received organs from donors with and without HIV at 32 transplant centers in the United States. RESULT(S): Between March 20, 2020 and September 25, 2020, there were 11 COVID-19 cases among 291 kidney and liver recipients with HIV (4%). In those with COVID-19, median age was 59 y, 10 were male, 8 were kidney recipients, and 5 had donors with HIV. A higher proportion of recipients with COVID-19 compared with the overall HOPE in the Action cohort were Hispanic (55% versus 12%) and received transplants in New York City (73% versus 34%, P < 0.05). Most (10/11, 91%) were hospitalized. High-level oxygen support was required in 7 and intensive care in 5; 1 participant opted for palliative care instead of transfer to the intensive care unit. HIV RNA was undetectable in all. Median absolute lymphocyte count was 0.3 x 103 cells/muL. Median CD4 pre-COVID-19 was 298 cells/muL, declining to <200 cells/mul in 6/7 with measurements on admission. Treatment included high-dose steroids (n = 6), tocilizumab (n = 3), remdesivir (n = 2), and convalescent plasma (n = 2). Four patients (36%) died. CONCLUSION(S): Within a national prospective cohort of kidney and liver transplant recipients with HIV, we report high mortality from COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

0	Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made unprecedented impact on the psychological health of university students, a population vulnerable to distress and mental health disorders. This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (N = 1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020., RESULTS: Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Interventions targeting multi-level factors, such as promoting mindfulness and social support at individual and interpersonal levels while reducing public stigma about COVID-19, may be particularly promising. Attending to the needs of disadvantaged groups including those financially impacted by COVID-19 is needed.	false
0	"Association Between Care Utilization and Anxiety Outcomes in an On-Demand Mental Health System: Retrospective Observational Study. BACKGROUND: Anxiety is an extremely prevalent condition, and yet, it has received notably less attention than depression and other mental health conditions from a research, clinical, and public health perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated growing concerns about the burden of anxiety due to the confluence of physical health risks, economic stressors, social isolation, and general disruption of daily activities., OBJECTIVE: This study examines differences in anxiety outcomes by care modality (coaching, teletherapy and telepsychiatry, and combined care) within an on-demand mental health system. We also explore the association between levels of engagement within each care modality and odds of improvement in symptoms of anxiety., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of individuals who accessed Ginger, an on-demand mental health system. Data were collected from 1611 Ginger members between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used logistic regression to assess the association between care modality and improvement in anxiety symptoms. Within each modality, we assessed the association between level of engagement and improvement., RESULTS: Of 1611 Ginger members, 761 (47.0%) experienced a decrease in anxiety symptoms, as measured by a change from a positive to a negative 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screen. Among members who still screened positive at follow-up (865/1611, 53%), a total of 192 members (11.9%) experienced a clinically significant score reduction in the full GAD-7 (ie, a score reduction of >5 points), even though their GAD-2 scores were still positive. All modalities showed increased odds of improvement compared to those who were not engaged with coaching or clinical services (""app-only""). Higher GAD-7 intake scores were also associated with decreased odds of improvement., CONCLUSIONS: This study found increased odds of anxiety improvement for all care modalities compared to those who did not engage in care, with larger effect sizes for higher utilization within all care modalities. Additionally, there is a promising observation that those engaged in combined care (teletherapy and text-based coaching) had the greatest odds of anxiety improvement. Future directions include more detailed classifications of utilization patterns and an exploration of explanations and solutions for lower-utilization members.

0	Occupational hazards in anaesthesiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor of the United States, the exposure risk for anaesthesiologists working with COVID-19 patients can be classified as high or very high. This is mostly due to fact that the anaesthesiologists work in close contact with patients' airways, and the aerosol-generating nature of some procedures they perform. Fortunately, despite the occupational hazard, the incidence of COVID-19 among anaesthesiologists and intensivists remains relatively low. Current evidence suggests that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this group were either contracted outside of the work environment or can be attributed to personal protective equipment (PPE) malfunction. This article focuses on different aspects of anaesthesiologists' safety, risks connected with different clinical scenarios and procedures, issues related to testing and screening, as well as modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for severe illness or from COVID-19. This analysis is accompanied by a review of guidelines dedicated to mitigating said risks. Educating the personnel, introducing appropriate procedures, and proper utilisation of PPE are essential to the safety of all parties involved in hospital care, particularly those with significant exposure risk.Copyright © 2020 Via Medica.

0	Effects of COVID-19 on Sense of Smell: Human Factors/Ergonomics Considerations. OBJECTIVE: We review the effects of COVID-19 on the human sense of smell (olfaction) and discuss implications for human-system interactions. We emphasize how critical smell is and how the widespread loss of smell due to COVID-19 will impact human-system interaction., BACKGROUND: COVID-19 reduces the sense of smell in people who contract the disease. Thus far, olfaction has received relatively little attention from human factors/ergonomics professionals. While smell is not a primary means of human-system communication, humans rely on smell in many important ways related to both quality of life and safety., METHOD: We briefly review and synthesize the rapidly expanding literature through September 2020 on the topic of smell loss caused by COVID-19. We interpret findings in terms of their relevance to human factors/ergonomics researchers and practitioners., RESULTS: Since March 2020 dozens of articles have been published that report smell loss in COVID-19 patients. The prevalence and duration of COVID-19-related smell loss is still under investigation, but the available data suggest that it may leave many people with long-term deficits and distortions in sense of smell., CONCLUSION: We suggest that the human factors/ergonomics community could become more aware of the importance of the sense of smell and focus on accommodating the increasing number of people with reduced olfactory performance., APPLICATION: We present examples of how olfaction can augment human-system communication and how human factors/ergonomics professionals might accommodate people with olfactory dysfunction. While seemingly at odds, both of these goals can be achieved.	false
0	Multifactorial expression of IL-6 with update on COVID-19 and the therapeutic strategies of its blockade (Review). Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a cytokine produced by various cells of the human body (macrophages, lymphocytes, astrocytes, ischemic myocytes, endothelial cells) has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties, being a key component in regulating various physiologic and pathological processes. The structure of this molecule and the receptor system it possesses are important due to the different activities that IL-6 can exert; through trans-signaling pro-inflammatory activities are medi- ated, while through classic signaling, IL-6 is responsible for anti-inflammatory and regenerative activities. IL-6 signaling is involved in coronary artery disease and the global COVID-19 pandemic. This proatherogenic cytokine reaches elevated serum levels in the cytokine storm generated by SARS-CoV-2, and is also associated with smoking or obesity-classic cardiovascular risk factors which promote inflammatory states. IL-6 levels are proportionally correlated with dyslipidemia, hypertension and glucose dysregulation, and they are associated with poor outcomes in patients with unstable angina or acute myocar- dial infarction. IL-6 targeting for treatment development (not only) in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is still a matter of ongoing research, although tocilizumab has proven to be effective in reducing the proatherogenic effects of IL-6 and is suggested to improve COVID-19 patient survival.Copyright © 2021 Spandidos Publications.

0	A review of COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 with focus on proof of efficacy. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is rapidly becoming an established consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 patients though there is a need to critically review this area for proof of efficacy. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are considered to play main role in viral clearance. CP infusion may also help in the modulation of immune response by its immunomodulatory effect. The FDA allows for administration of CP to COVID-19 patients. The present published literature in COVID-19 is limited to case series and randomised controlled trial where plasma therapy was used in moderate, severe and critically ill patients. Though multiple uncertainties exist regarding to its efficacy, appropriate donor selection and NAb titres, the efficacy data of CP use inCOVID-19 is limited having shown hope with early and severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Institutionalising wastewater surveillance systems to minimise the impact of COVID-19: cases of Indonesia, Japan and Viet Nam. This mini review describes the current status and challenges regarding institutionalisation of wastewater surveillance systems against COVID-19. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been proposed to be a potential tool to understand the actual prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, and it could be an effective approach to monitor the trend during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, challenges to institutionalise wastewater surveillance systems are still abundant and unfolding at a rapid rate given that the international understanding regarding the scientific knowledge and socio-political impacts of COVID-19 are in the developing stages. To better understand the existing challenges and bottlenecks, a comparative study between Japan, Viet Nam, and Indonesia was carried out in the present study. Through gaining a better understanding of common issues as well as issues specific to each country, we hope to contribute to building a robust multistakeholder system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as an effective disease surveillance system for COVID-19.	false
0	[COVID-19: Coagulopathy and thrombosis]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a global pandemic within weeks. Many patients with severe COVID-19 present with coagulation abnormalities, including increase D-dimers. This coagulopathy is associated with an increased risk of death. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 develop sometimes unrecognized, venous thromboembolic complications. A better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in particular hemostatic disorders, will help to choose appropriate treatment strategies. A rigorous thrombotic risk assessment and the implementation of a suitable anticoagulation strategy are required. We review here the characteristics of COVID-19 coagulation laboratory findings in affected patients, the incidence of thromboembolic events and their specificities, and potential therapeutic interventions.

0	Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection: a rapid review. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease., OBJECTIVES: We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19., SEARCH METHODS: An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020., SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach., MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.

0	Impact of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been associated with unfavourable pregnancy outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the human coronavirus family, and since this infection shows a pandemic trend it will involve many pregnant women. Aims: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 8th May 2020. Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19. Content: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70-100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1-20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72-94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0-6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at birth. Elevated levels of IgM and IgG Serum antibodies were reported in one case, but negative swab. Implications: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, COVID-19 should not be considered as an indication for elective caesarean section. (C) 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

0	Stability analysis and optimal control of covid-19 with convex incidence rate in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (Pakistan). The dynamic of covid-19 epidemic model with a convex incidence rate is studied in this article. First, we formulate the model without control and study all the basic properties and results including local and global stability. We show the global stability of disease free equilibrium using the method of Lyapunov function theory while for disease endemic, we use the method of geometrical approach. Furthermore, we develop a model with suitable optimal control strategies. Our aim is to minimize the infection in the host population. In order to do this, we use two control variables. Moreover, sensitivity analysis complemented by simulations are performed to determine how changes in parameters affect the dynamical behavior of the system. Taking into account the central manifold theory the bifurcation analysis is also incorporated. The numerical simulations are performed in order to show the feasibility of the control strategy and effectiveness of the theoretical results. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	Effective epidemic model for COVID-19 using accumulated deaths. The severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 has been in the center of the ongoing global health crisis in 2020. The high prevalence of mild cases facilitates sub-notification outside hospital environments and the number of those who are or have been infected remains largely unknown, leading to poor estimates of the crude mortality rate of the disease. Here we use a simple model to describe the number of accumulated deaths caused by COVID-19. The close connection between the proposed model and an approximate solution of the SIR model provides estimates of epidemiological parameters. We find values for the crude mortality between 10- 4 and 10- 3 which are lower than estimates numbers obtained from laboratory-confirmed patients. We also calculate quantities of practical interest such as the basic reproduction number and subsequent increment after relaxation of lockdown and other control measures.

0	Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Glomerulonephritis in a Case of Scleroderma After Recent Diagnosis With COVID-19. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare occurrence in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients. AAV is an inflammatory disease that can lead to kidney failure due to the infiltration of mononuclear cells and the destruction of blood vessels. Also, crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) has rarely been reported with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acute tubular injury is the most common renal pathology lesion in these patients. We present a rare case of a 46-year-old woman with SSc with new onset of renal failure after a recent diagnosis of COVID-19. Her serology was positive for p-ANCA and myeloperoxidase antibodies. Kidney biopsy was done and showed crescentic GN. We suggest during this pandemic, patients with an immunological disorder that are infected with COVID-19 be closely monitored for any organ involvement.	false
0	Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 spike 69/70 deletion, E484K, and N501Y variants by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited sera. We engineered three SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing key spike mutations from the newly emerged United Kingdom (UK) and South African (SA) variants: N501Y from UK and SA; 69/70-deletion+N501Y+D614G from UK; and E484K+N501Y+D614G from SA. Neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) of twenty BTN162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera against the three mutant viruses were 0.81- to 1.46-fold of the GMTs against parental virus, indicating small effects of these mutations on neutralization by sera elicited by two BNT162b2 doses.	false
0	Antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19: rapid review and meta-analysis. Background: The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance. Objective(s): The aim was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9 2020. Study Eligibility Criteria: We included randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >=10 patients; and experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. Participant(s): The study participants were patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all healthcare settings (hospital and community) and age groups (paediatric and adult). Method(s): The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. Result(s): We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30 623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3-80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33) compared with adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95% CI 1.18-1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95% CI 1.15-1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. Conclusion(s): Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection. Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely to be high in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021	false
0	Nosocomial infections during COVID-19 surge: Increased incidence and very common use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Introduction: COVID-19 has challenged our health system and our standard practices. Mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID-19 patients have long intensive care unit (ICU) stays [1] increasing their exposure to nosocomial infections (NI). Objective(s): In a perspective of quality improvement, we studied the incidence of NI and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSA) in MV COVID-19 patients. Method(s): We collected data retrospectively for every MV COVID-19 patient admitted to our 18-to 38-bed expanded ICU between 01.03. and 30.04.2020. ICU days, ventilation days (VD), catheter days (CD), use of BSA, fever days (> 38degreeC) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded. Each suspected NI, defined by the introduction of BSA >= 48h after admission or repeated administration of BSA after an antibiotic free period >= 48h, was reviewed by an infectiologist. NI were confirmed using CDC criteria [2] for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), or clinical evidence for septic shock (SS) and bacteremia (BE) from another origin. Result(s): Of 54 COVID-19 patients, 37 MV patients (69%) spent a total of 672 ICU days, with 504 VD and 545 CD. They had fever during 26.5% of ICU days. Median peak CRP was 309 mg/l (IQR, 264-365) after a median stay of 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Among 31 suspected NI, 21 (68%) NI were confirmed: 4 VAP, 6 CLABSI, 1 UTI, 8 SS and 2 BE from another origin. The incidence of VAP and CLABSI was respectively 7.9/1000 VD and 11/1000 CD. Our 2019 annual incidence for VAP and CLABSI was 3.9/1000 VD and 1.7/1000 CD. Global incidence of confirmed NI was 31.3/1000 ICU days. Conclusion(s): The incidence of confirmed VAP and CLABSI was higher in MV COVID-19 patients than in our standard ICU population of 2019. COVID-19 patients might have a greater risk of NI due to anatomical barrier disruption and maladaptive immune response, but other factors such as cohorting of several patients in the same room, using gloves for self-protection with insufficient replacement and temporary deviation from standardized procedures could have contributed to the incidence of NI. BSA were often prescribed early during ICU stay, reflecting physician's anxiety facing this new disease and the difficulty to diagnose NI. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia induces a prolonged fever, high inflammatory state, diffuse lung infiltrates and protracted respiratory failure, which makes classical criteria for VAP less specific. In that setting, NI definitions should be refined to find an optimized set point for BSA introduction, avoiding under-and overuse.	false
0	An increase in CD62Ldim neutrophils precedes the development of pulmonary embolisms in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: A high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is reported in patients with critical Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID-19 associated PE., METHODS: We studied COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19-03-2020 and 17-05-2020. Point-of-care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay., RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7-12) days. A significant increase in the immune-suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16bright /CD62Ldim was observed on the day of ICU admission (p=0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16bright /CD62Ldim neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID19 patients.

0	Association of Social and Demographic Factors With COVID-19 Incidence and Death Rates in the US. Importance: Descriptive data have revealed significant racial/ethnic disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US, but underlying mechanisms of disparities remain unknown., Objective: To examine the association between county-level sociodemographic risk factors and US COVID-19 incidence and mortality., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between US county-level sociodemographic risk factors and COVID-19 incidence using mixed-effects negative binomial regression, and COVID-19 mortality using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality were collected from January 20 to July 29, 2020. The association of social risk factors with weekly cumulative incidence and mortality was also examined by interacting time with the index measures, using a random intercept to account for repeated measures., Main Outcomes and Measures: Sociodemographic data from publicly available data sets, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which includes subindices of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority and English language proficiency status, and housing and transportation., Results: As of July 29, 2020, there were a total of 4289283 COVID-19 cases and 147074 COVID-19 deaths in the US. An increase of 0.1 point in SVI score was associated with a 14.3% increase in incidence rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16; P < .001) and 13.7% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12-1.16; P < .001), or an excess of 87 COVID-19 cases and 3 COVID-19 deaths per 100000 population for a SVI score change from 0.5 to 0.6 in a midsize metropolitan county; subindices were also associated with both outcomes. A 0.1-point increase in the overall SVI was associated with a 0.9% increase in weekly cumulative increase in incidence rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P < .001) and 0.5% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P < .001)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, a wide range of sociodemographic risk factors, including socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority status, household composition, and environmental factors, were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. To address inequities in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these social vulnerabilities and their root causes must be addressed.	false

0	Character of hematological parameters change in patients with COVID-19. In the first half of 2020, there were reports in the medical press about the presence of signs of polyorganic infection with coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was suggested that an additional role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 hemoglobinopathy, hypoxia and iron overloading of cells of the parenchymatous organs. Based on these concepts and hypotheses, a system of pathogenetic therapy has been formed, but the positions of some hypotheses have not yet been confirmed by clinical studies. To clarify them, additional laboratory tests are required. Objective. To study peripheral blood parameters and their dynamics in COVID-19 patients treated with the diagnosis of <> in the municipal hospital in Moscow from April to June 2020. Material and methods. Were examined 206 patients (82 men and 124 women) aged 26 to 97 years (average age 56.8+/-6.1 years) who were undergoing treatment in the 3rd department of GKB No. 15. O.M. Filatov with diagnoses: COVID-19 and pneumonia. 197 of them were discharged from the hospital, 9 died. The study of peripheral blood and counting of leukocyte formula were performed on Cobas Micro and Advia-21-20 analyzers (Simens, Germany). Biochemical studies were performed on spectrophotometer Getpremier (USA). Results. Analysis of the nature of changes in the number of leukocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia showed that cases of leukocytopenia were rare in patients (7% of patients), leukocytosis was detected in more than 20% of patients. The difference between the incidence of leukopenia and leukocytosis was 13.5%, but was not significant (p>0.2). Signs of lymphopenia were observed somewhat more frequently than lymphocytosis (in the evaluation of relative lymphocytosis - by 13.1%), but the difference was not statistically reliable. In assessing the number of lymphocytes in blood in patients with COVID- 19. Conclusion. The data obtained indicate a combined, multi-component pathogenic effect of COVID-19 virus on all three sprouts of hemopoiesis system in pneumonia patients: oppression of erythrocyte saturation processes with hemoglobin, erythropoiesis stimulation in some of them, change in platelet volume, formation of abnormal macroform plates, absence of reactive leukocytosis for acute inflammation, decrease in number of monocytic phagocytes and lymphoid cells. It is possible that some of these changes may affect the prognosis and the severity of the disease course.Copyright © 2020, Media Sphera Publishing Group. All rights reserved.	false
0	Expression of the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 and proinflammatory cytokines induced by the periodontopathic bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum in human respiratory epithelial cells. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a global public health emergency. Periodontitis, the most prevalent disease that leads to tooth loss, is caused by infection by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontitis is also a risk factor for pneumonia and the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease, presumably because of the aspiration of saliva contaminated with periodontopathic bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. Patients with these diseases have increased rates of COVID-19 aggravation and mortality. Because periodontopathic bacteria have been isolated from the bron-choalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, periodontitis may be a risk factor for COVID-19 aggravation. However, the molecular links between periodontitis and COVID-19 have not been clarified. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of the periodontopathic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (CSF) upregulated the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, CSF induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production by both A549 and primary alveolar epithelial cells. CSF also strongly induced IL-6 and IL-8 expression by BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and Detroit 562 pharyngeal epithelial cells. These results suggest that when patients with mild COVID-19 frequently aspirate periodontopathic bac-teria, SARS-CoV-2 infection is promoted, and inflammation in the lower respiratory tract may be-come severe in the presence of viral pneumonia.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to human health, health care systems, public life, and economy around the globe. The repertoire of effective therapies for severe courses of the disease has remained limited. A large proportion of the world population suffers from vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, with prevalence being particularly high among the COVID-19 high-risk populations. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.Copyright © 2021 by the author.

0	"Clinical Symptom Differences Between Mild and Severe COVID-19 Patients in China: A Meta-Analysis. Objective: The prognosis of mild and severe patients has prominent differences during the prevalence of COVID-19, and it will be significant to identify patients' potential risk of progressing to severe cases according to their first clinical presentations. Therefore, we aim to review the clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 epidemic systematically. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI (Chinese Database) for studies about the clinical features of COVID-19 in China from March 18 to April 18. Then we used REVMAN to conduct a meta-analysis. Results: After screening, 20 articles including 3,326 COVID-19 confirmed cases were selected from 142 articles we retrieved at the beginning of our research. We divided all the cases into a severe group (including severe and critically severe patients) and a mild group according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Infection-Induced Pneumonia"" version 4 (trial). Of all the initial symptoms (including fever, cough, abdominal pain, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhea, dyspnea, expectoration, fatigue, headache, hemoptysis, myalgia, nausea or vomiting, and pharyngalgia) we studied, we found that cough (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.7; p < 0.001), fever (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9; p < 0.001), dyspnea (OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 3.6-10.6; p < 0.001), diarrhea (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-4.9; p < 0.001), fatigue (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.3; p < 0.01), expectoration (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.6; p < 0.01), myalgia (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.8-3.1; p < 0.001), hemoptysis (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.5-11.3; p < 0.001), abdominal pain (OR = 7.5, 95% CI: 2.4-23.4; p < 0.001), and anorexia (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.5-5.1; p < 0.001) had a different distribution in two groups and were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion:  COVID-19 patients whose initial manifestation is dyspnea, hemoptysis, anorexia, diarrhea, or fatigue, especially abdominal pain should be closely monitored to prevent disease deterioration.

0	Anxiety, depression, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in Chinese nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. AIMS: To explore the association between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and anxiety and depression among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak., BACKGROUND: Nurses play a vital role in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, but many of them suffer from psychological problems due to the excessive workload and stress. Understanding the correlation between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and anxiety and depression will promote targeted psychosocial interventions for these affected nurses., METHODS: This cross-sectional study of 586 nurses was conducted in Eastern China. Participants completed online questionnaires that investigated anxiety, depression, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies., RESULTS: The prevalence of nurses' anxiety and depression was 27.6% and 32.8%, respectively. Lower self-blame, rumination, and catastrophizing, as well as greater acceptance and positive refocusing, were related to fewer symptoms of anxiety or depression., CONCLUSION: The cognitive emotion regulation strategies of acceptance and positive refocusing contribute to reducing anxiety or depression. These strategies should be considered when implementing psychotherapeutic interventions to improve nurses' adverse emotional symptoms., IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This study highlights the need to assess cognitive emotion regulation strategies use in screening for anxiety and depression. Nurse managers should develop psychosocial interventions including appropriate strategies to help nurses with adverse emotions during a pandemic. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin Therapy and QT Prolongation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in a cohort of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ/AZM)., BACKGROUND: HCQ/AZM is being widely used to treat COVID-19 despite the known risk of QT interval prolongation and the unknown risk of arrhythmogenesis in this population., METHODS: A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients treated with HCQ/AZM was reviewed. The QTc interval was calculated before drug administration and for the first 5 days following initiation. The primary endpoint was the magnitude of QTc prolongation, and factors associated with QTc prolongation. Secondary endpoints were incidences of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and all-cause mortality., RESULTS: Among 415 patients who received concomitant HCQ/AZM, the mean QTc increased from 443 +/- 25 ms to a maximum of 473 +/- 40 ms (87 [21%] patients had a QTc >=500 ms). Factors associated with QTc prolongation >=500 ms were age (p < 0.001), body mass index <30 kg/m2 (p = 0.005), heart failure (p < 0.001), elevated creatinine (p = 0.005), and peak troponin (p < 0.001). The change in QTc was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population in which mortality was already high (hazard ratio: 0.998; p = 0.607). No primary high-grade ventricular arrhythmias were observed., CONCLUSIONS: An increase in QTc was seen in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/AZM. Several clinical factors were associated with greater QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were not associated with increased risk of death. Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

0	Deep vein thrombosis screening of COVID-19 patients in intensive care. Introduction: Patients infected with COVID-19 are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications as demonstrated in autopsy findings(Wichmann et al) and observational clinical studies(Helms et al). Recognising this increased risk, our intensive care unit started a screening programme using compression ultrasound to detect venous thrombosis. Method(s): From 1st April 2020, any patient admitted to our adult intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 underwent compression ultrasound of the external iliac veins to popliteal trifurcation and the internal jugular veins. This scan was carried out shortly after admission to ICU and repeated weekly until ICU discharge. Scans were performed by medical staff trained in compression ultrasound. Any scans felt to demonstrate thrombus meriting anticoagulation were reviewed by a senior clinician with experience in compression ultrasound. Any doubt or disagreement prompted further assessment by a radiologist or sonographer. Result(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were cared for in ICU during this project. The demographics are summarised below. Fifteen patients (68.2%) were found to have thrombus of varying severity on compression ultrasound. Eight were judged to merit treatment with anticoagulation. Of the eight patients that were anticoagulated, 7 were diagnosed on compression ultrasound screening. Five were found to have lower limb DVTs, 2 of which were bilateral. Two patients had occlusive thrombus in an internal jugular vein. One patient was anticoagulated following thrombolysis for a clinical diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolus. Patients with proximal femoral vein DVTs were treated in the prone position more times (median 5 [4-6]) than those without (median 2 [1-5]). They were also more likely to have a higher Body Mass Index (median 32 [31-36] vs 27.5 [25-36]). Eight patients had non-occlusive thrombus in an internal jugular vein, not considered large enough to merit systemic anticoagulation and all were associated with central venous catheters sites. Five patients underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiograms (CTPA), all of which were negative. Two patients suffered bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy, one developed minor haematuria and one life threatening spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage requiring embolisation. Conclusion(s): Given the recognised risk of thromboembolic complications in critically unwell COVID-19 patients, the higher prevalence of severe disease in obese patients(Simonnet et al, Caussy et al) and the frequent use of prone position ventilation, we feel that DVT screening merits consideration as a routine part of the care of these patients. Compression ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive bedside investigation that uses existing technology that is familiar to critical care staff.	false
0	The Latin America and the Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD): From Networking to Research to Implementation Science. In comparison with other regions, dementia prevalence in Latin America is growing rapidly, along with the consequent clinical, social, and economic burden upon patients and their families. The combination of fragile health care systems, large social inequalities, and isolated clinical and research initiatives makes the coordination of efforts imperative. The Latin America and the Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) is a regional organization overseeing and promoting clinical and research activities on dementia. Here, we first provide an overview of the consortium, highlighting the antecedents and current mission. Then, we present the consortium's regional research, including the multi-partner consortium to expand dementia research in Latin America (ReDLat), which aims to identify the unique genetic, social, and economic factors that drive Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia presentation in LAC relative to the US. We describe an extension of ReDLat which aims to develop affordable markers of disease subtype and severity using high density EEG. We introduce current initiatives promoting regional diagnosis, visibility, and capacity, including the forthcoming launch of the Latin American Brain Health Institute (BrainLat). We discuss LAC-CD-led advances in brain health diplomacy, including an assessment of responses to the impact of COVID-19 on people with dementia and examining the knowledge of public policies among experts in the region. Finally, we present the current knowledge-to-action framework, which paves the way for a future regional action plan. Coordinated actions are crucial to forging strong regional bonds, supporting the implementation of regional dementia plans, improving health systems, and expanding research collaborations across Latin America.	false
0	Myasthenia gravis associated with anti-MuSK antibodies developed after SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTRODUCTION: Since the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic, several neurological complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, affecting central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junction. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 77-year-old man who developed bulbar myasthenia gravis (MG) eight weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The search for serum antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 antibodies, performed by radioimmunoassay (RIA), resulted negative, while anti-MuSK antibodies were detected by cell-based assay (CBA). The patient was treated with pyridostigmine (60 mg four times a day) with unsatisfactory clinical response, followed by immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/day) with improvement of MG symptoms after two months of treatment. DISCUSSION: Several viral diseases have been described as associated with the onset of MG, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Similarly, a growing number of scientific reports suggest a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoimmune diseases. The interest of our case lies in the timing of the MG onset (after two months from infection), together with the unusual late onset of anti-MuSK MG. These elements suggest that coronavirus infection may act as a trigger of the disease. We confirm the importance of CBA in the serological diagnosis of RIA-negative MG.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 pandemic: demographic and clinical correlates of passive death wish and thoughts of self-harm among Canadians. BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation can be triggered or exacerbated by psychosocial stressors including natural disasters and pandemics., AIMS: This study investigated prevalence rates and demographic and clinical correlates of self-reported passive death wishes and thoughts of self-harm among Canadians subscribing to Text4Hope; a daily supportive text message program., METHODS: A survey link was sent out to Text4Hope subscribers. Demographic information was captured and clinical data collected using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data were analysed with descriptive analysis, the chi-square test, and logistic regression., RESULTS: Responders showed an increase in prevalence rates for passive death wish and thoughts of self-harm compared to baseline Canadian statistics on suicidality. Responders aged 25years, Indigenous, had less than high school education, unemployed, single, living with family, with increased anxiety, disordered sleep, and recent concerns about germs and contamination were at greatest risk., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that suicidal thoughts may have increased in the general population as a result of COVID-19 and signals an urgent need for public education on appropriate health seeking methods and increased access to mental and social support especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and its immediate aftermath.	false
0	Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally-Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An Overview. 	false
0	Cytokine storm: A substantial peril to human health. Immune system is a magnificent integration of cells and endogenous proteins that work together to bestow defense against infections. Cytokines are involved in a number of pathological and immune responses having plethora of activities. Under usual circumstances, the cytokines facilitate and coordinate with the various components of immune system and act as a paramount category of signaling molecules. Cytokine storm is a rigorous increase in the concentration of cytokines in response to an infection or inflammation. It is a cascade of catastrophic immune responses that can cause many adverse setbacks. Cytokine storm syndrome is a set of symptoms that arises due to immune response against specific pathogens and can lead to uncontrolled inflammatory conditions as well as acute respiratory distress. It may result in severe tissue damage or mortality. The impact of seriousness in COVID-19 patients has been associated with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and pervasive tissue injury resulting in multi-organ failure. The excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines which promote systemic inflammations can also be predicted by exorbitant neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. Neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia are the physiological responses of immune system against systemic inflammations. Patients with severe COVID-19 have high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Targeting the cytokines during management of COVID-19 patients can reduce the risk of mortality and can ameliorate the defaced malady also.Copyright © 2021, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Paper-based electrochemical biosensor for diagnosing COVID-19: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antigen. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a global pandemic outbreak. To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	"Prevalence of comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19: A rapid review of current literature. Introduction: On February 11, 2020 WHO designated the name ""COVID-19"" for the disease caused by ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that quickly turned into a global pandemic. Risks associated with acquiring the virus have been found to most significantly vary by age and presence of underlying comorbidity. In this rapid literature review we explore the prevalence of comorbidities and associated adverse outcomes among individuals with COVID-19 and summarize our findings based on information available as of May 15, 2020. Method(s): A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar to find articles published until May 15, 2020. All relevant articles providing information on PCR tested COVID-19 positive patient population with clinical characteristics and epidemiological information were selected for review and analysis. Result(s): A total of 27 articles consisting of 22,753 patient cases from major epicenters worldwide were included in the study. Major comorbidities seen in overall population were CVD (8.9%), HTN (27.4%), Diabetes (17.4%), COPD (7.5%), Cancer (3.5%), CKD (2.6%), and other (15.5%). Major comorbidity specific to countries included in the study were China (HTN 39.5%), South Korea (CVD 25.6%), Italy (HTN 35.9%), USA (HTN 38.9%), Mexico, (Other 42.3%), UK (HTN 27.8%), Iran (Diabetes 35.0%). Within fatal cases, an estimated 84.1% had presence of one or more comorbidity. Subgroup analysis of fatality association with having comorbidity had an estimated OR 0.83, CI [0.60-0.99], p<0.05. Conclusion(s): Based on our findings, hypertension followed by diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were the most common comorbidity seen in COVID-19 positive patients across major epicenters world-wide. Although having one or more comorbidity is linked to increased disease severity, no clear association was found between having these risk factors and increased risk of fatality.Copyright © 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc."	false
0	Early Use of Corticosteroid May Prolong SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Non-Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Multicenter, Single-Blind, Randomized Control Trial. BACKGROUND: There is still no clinical evidence available to support or to oppose corticosteroid treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid given to the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia., METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized control trial. Adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the general ward were randomly assigned to either receive methylprednisolone or not for 7 days. The primary end point was the incidence of clinical deterioration 14 days after randomization., RESULTS: We terminated this trial early because the number of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in all the centers decreased in late March. Finally, a total of 86 COVID-19 patients underwent randomization. There was no difference of the incidence of clinical deterioration between the methylprednisolone group and control group (4.8 vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000). The duration of throat viral RNA detectability in the methylprednisolone group was 11 days (interquartile range, 6-16 days), which was significantly longer than that in the control group (8 days [2-12 days], p = 0.030). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in other secondary outcomes. Mass cytometry discovered CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells in the methylprednisolone group which were significantly lower than those in the control group after randomization (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: From this prematurely closed trial, we found that the short-term early use of corticosteroid could suppress the immune cells, which may prolong severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04273321.

0	Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report. BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known., CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital., CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.	false
0	Tracking the time course of pathological patterns of lung injury in severe COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 is characterized pathologically by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and thrombosis, leading to the clinical picture of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. The direct action of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells and the dysregulated immuno-coagulative pathways activated in ARDS influence pulmonary involvement in severe COVID, that might be modulated by disease duration and individual factors. In this study we assessed the proportions of different lung pathology patterns in severe COVID-19 patients along the disease evolution and individual characteristics., METHODS: We analysed lung tissue from 41 COVID-19 patients that died in the period March-June 2020 and were submitted to a minimally invasive autopsy. Eight pulmonary regions were sampled. Pulmonary pathologists analysed the H&E stained slides, performing semiquantitative scores on the following parameters: exudative, intermediate or advanced DAD, bronchopneumonia, alveolar haemorrhage, infarct (%), arteriolar (number) or capillary thrombosis (yes/no). Histopathological data were correlated with demographic-clinical variables and periods of symptoms-hospital stay., RESULTS: Patient's age varied from 22 to 88 years (18f/23 m), with hospital admission varying from 0 to 40 days. All patients had different proportions of DAD in their biopsies. Ninety percent of the patients presented pulmonary microthrombosis. The proportion of exudative DAD was higher in the period 0-8 days of hospital admission till death, whereas advanced DAD was higher after 17 days of hospital admission. In the group of patients that died within eight days of hospital admission, elderly patients had less proportion of the exudative pattern and increased proportions of the intermediate patterns. Obese patients had lower proportion of advanced DAD pattern in their biopsies, and lower than patients with overweight. Clustering analysis showed that patterns of vascular lesions (microthrombosis, infarction) clustered together, but not the other patterns. The vascular pattern was not influenced by demographic or clinical parameters, including time of disease progression., CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 present different proportions of DAD patterns over time, with advanced DAD being more prevalent after 17 days, which seems to be influenced by age and weight. Vascular involvement is present in a large proportion of patients, occurs early in disease progression, and does not change over time.	false

0	Experience of ultrasound application in diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia. Purpose. To assess the possibilities of using the ultrasound method in detecting signs of pneumonia associated with COVID-19. Material and methods. The experience of using ultrasound lungs examination of 75 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Ultrasound studies were carried out on a portable device Mindray DC-6900 (China) using linear transducers at a frequency of 5.0-15 MHz and convex transducers at a frequency of 3.5-5.0 MHz. The method of ultrasound examination of the chest organs provided for a sequential examination and assessment of twelve conventional scanning zones. The presence of artifacts of the ultrasound image along the horizontal (A-line) and confluent vertical (B-lines) scanning lines was studied. Results. Ultrasound examination of the lungs of 75 patients with COVID-19 revealed vertical artifacts of the ultrasound image. Focal or confluent B-lines (49,3% patients), as well as thickening and compaction of the pleural line (44% patients), subpleural consolidations in the form of hypoechoic areas under the pleural line (34,7% patients). Pleural effusions were found in 3 (4%) cases. In 35 (46,7%) patients with a mild course of the disease and an asymptomatic form, according to the ultrasound examination, horizontal A-lines were identified, which indicated the preservation of the airiness of the lungs. Discussion. The main ultrasound diagnostic criteria for pneumonia caused by SARSCoV-2 is the absence of horizontal A-lines and the appearance of vertical B-lines. Subpleural consolidations and changes in the pleural line served as additional ultrasound signs. Ultrasound signs and the number of affected areas correlated with the severity of the disease. False negative results were associated with deep-seated consolidations or shielding by scapulae and ribs. Significant difficulties in imaging the chest organs have arisen in obese patients. In these cases, the data of ultrasound studies in combination with X-ray and CT scan facilitated a more precise diagnosis of the course of the disease. Conclusion. Ultrasound examination is one of the available methods in the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of the disease and can be used more widely in clinical practice..Copyright © 2020 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and severity of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 treated at Sabara Hospital Infantil. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional, retrospective, and observational study. All cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-qPCR of patients seen at the hospital (emergency room, first-aid room, and ICU) were analyzed. The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus. Result(s): Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys (57%) was verified, and the median age was two years. A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU. Of the total, 26% had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma (13%). Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58% of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34%. Three children were asymptomatic, 81 (70%) had upper airway symptoms, 15 (13%) had mild pneumonia, and 16 (14%) had severe pneumonia. Hospitalized children were younger than nonhospitalized children (7 months vs. 36 months). In hospitalized patients, a higher frequency of irritability, dyspnea, drowsiness, respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and hepatomegaly was observed. Chest radiography was performed in 69 children with 45% of abnormal exams. No child required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths. Conclusion(s): Most of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 had mild upper airway symptoms. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were more severe among younger children who exhibited gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms more frequently.Copyright © 2021 Sao Paulo Pediatric Society.

0	Prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19., SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively., MAIN RESULTS: We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. Since there are 22 ongoing studies that plan to evaluate more than 15,000 participants in this setting, we will add more robust evidence to this review in future updates.

0	Vitamin D levels in the UK MS population and COVID-19 susceptibility. Background: Despite the well-described association between vitamin D and MS, little is known about current behaviours surrounding vitamin D and the corresponding vitamin D status in this group at a population level across the UK. During the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in the role that vitamin D might play in reducing susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 has come to the foreground. Objective(s): To determine the vitamin D status of the UK MS population, understand the factors that influence it, and examine how vitamin D supplementation affects the risk of COVID-19. Method(s): A cohort study using the UK MS Register was performed. Self-reported data surrounding vitamin D and remotely collected biological samples were collected. 1768 people with MS (pwMS) completed a questionnaire regarding vitamin D-influencing behaviours; dried blood spots were collected from 388 of these pwMS and 309 matched controls, and serum 25(OH)D was measured. Subsequently, 592 participants from this MS cohort prospectively completed questionnaires evaluating symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Result(s): Marked differences were observed between supplementation behaviours with pwMS more likely to take supplements (72% vs 26% controls, p<0.001), and at higher doses (median 1600 IU/day vs 600 IU/day in controls, p<0.001). Serum levels of 25(OH)D were higher in pwMS than controls (71nmol/L, IQR 48 vs 49nmol/L, IQR 27, p<0.001). People with MS who did not supplement had lower serum 25(OH)D levels than non-supplementing controls (median 38 nmol/L, IQR 35 vs 44 nmol/L, IQR 21, p<0.001). 71% of those self-diagnosed with COVID-19 reported taking vitamin D vs 72% without COVID-19. Median dose for those with COVID-19 was reported as 1000 IU/day vs 2000 IU/day in those without (p=0.682). Conclusion(s): pwMS living in the UK are more likely to have adequate levels of vitamin D than controls, and is driven by the higher rate and dose of supplementation across this population. This has implications on the design and interpretation of any future clinical trials with vitamin D in this population. In addition, we found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation had an impact on susceptibility to COVID-19 in this population.	false

0	Trends in biosensing platforms for SARS-CoV-2 detection: A critical appraisal against standard detection tools. In this ongoing theme of COVID-19 pandemic, highly sensitive analytical testing platforms are extremely necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antiviral antibodies. To limit the viral spread, prompt and precise diagnosis is crucial to facilitate treatment and ensure effective isolation. Accurate detection of antibodies (IgG and IgM) is imperative to understand the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in public and to inspect the proportion of immune individuals. In this review, we demonstrate and evaluate some tests which have been used commonly to detect SARS-CoV-2. These include nucleic acid tests and serological tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific antibodies in infected people. Moreover, the vitality of biosensing technologies emphasizing on optical and electrochemical biosensors towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed here. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction owing to virus induced dysfunctioning of lung cells has also been highlighted.

0	SARS-CoV-2 impact on oral health: A general view. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. China reported the first case of COVID-19 in December 2019, and a few months later, the World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic. Oral ulcers in adult patients have been associated with COVID-19. However, no cases have yet been documented in children. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified in tissues of the oral cavity. Studies have identified the tongue as the site with the highest expression of ACE2, and the oral epithelium, gingival epithelium, and salivary glands as sites of lesser extent expression. ACE2 expression is lower in children and varies with age. SARS-CoV-2 in saliva has been identified in various studies, which suggests that this could be a useful sample for diagnosis. However, its presence in saliva would indicate the high risk of contagion of this fluid.	false
0	A real-world data study of coronavirus-2019 disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab. Background: Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS. The Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic raises concerns about clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 in MS patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment. Objective(s): To describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with ocrelizumab (OCR). Method(s): A retrospective cohort study of OCR treated MS patients with COVID-19 diagnosis who received treatment for COVID-19 in the Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record (EHR) dataset. Inclusion criteria: confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (ICD10 diagnosis, or positive diagnostic lab test since Feb 20th 2020), and OCR treatment <=6 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with less than 28 days of follow-up were excluded. COVID-19 severity was categorized according to a 4 level ordinal scale based on worst status experienced during COVID-19 clinical course: 1) not hospitalized, 2) hospitalized, 3) hospitalized requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, 4) death. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of hospitalized patients diagnosed with respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, and sepsis on admission. Result(s): As of 13 July 2020, there were EHRs for almost 128,000 patients with laboratory or clinically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Forty-seven OCR treated patients were identified (32% male, median age 47 years, median Charlson comorbidity index 1.0, mean BMI 29.4 kg/m2, mean time since OCR initiation 1.3 years). Per COVID-19 severity scale, 75% (n=35) were not admitted to hospital, 21% (n=10) were hospitalized, 2% (n=1) required invasive ventilation and 2% (n=1) died. Compared to OCR cohort, Hospitalized patients (n=12) were older (median age 57.0 years) and consisted of proportionally more males (50%). On hospital admission, of patients not requiring ventilation, 40% (n=4) had respiratory failure, 10% (n=1) bacterial pneumonia and 0% sepsis, while both patients requiring ventilation, one of whom subsequently died, had respiratory failure and sepsis on admission. Conclusion(s): In this large US cohort of confirmed/clinically COVID- 19, a few treated with OCR were identified with majority experiencing mild disease not requiring hospitalization, and two patients suffering critical illness. This study provides initial real-world insights on the impact of COVID-19 in MS patients treated with OCR.	false
0	Social, Cognitive, and eHealth Mechanisms of COVID-19-Related Lockdown and Mandatory Quarantine That Potentially Affect the Mental Health of Pregnant Women in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study. Background: Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine measures have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease of the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns have been raised over the threat that these measures pose to mental health, especially the mental health of vulnerable groups, including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective(s): This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. Method(s): An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. Result(s): Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (?2 14=495.21; P<.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; ?=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; ?=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. Conclusion(s): Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

0	The psychological effects of COVID-19 on hospital workers at the beginning of the outbreak with a large disease cluster on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and associated factors on hospital workers at the beginning of the outbreak with a large disease cluster on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data, mental health measurements, and stress-related questionnaires from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan, from March 23, 2020, to April 6, 2020. The prevalence rates of general psychological distress and event-related distress were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 26-item stress-related questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes for workers both at high- and low-risk for infection of COVID-19. A questionnaire was distributed to 4133 hospital workers, and 2697 (65.3%) valid questionnaires were used for analyses. Overall, 536 (20.0%) were high-risk workers, 944 (35.0%) of all hospital workers showed general distress, and 189 (7.0%) demonstrated event-related distress. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that 'Feeling of being isolated and discriminated' was associated with both the general and event-related distress for both the high- and low-risk workers. In this survey, not only high-risk workers but also low-risk workers in the hospitals admitting COVID-19 patients reported experiencing psychological distress at the beginning of the outbreak.Copyright © 2021 Ide et al.

0	Ultrarapid On-Site Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Simple ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy and an Analysis Algorithm: High Sensitivity and Specificity. There is an urgent need for ultrarapid testing regimens to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infections in real-time within seconds to stop its spread. Current testing approaches for this RNA virus focus primarily on diagnosis by RT-qPCR, which is time-consuming, costly, often inaccurate, and impractical for general population rollout due to the need for laboratory processing. The latency until the test result arrives with the patient has led to further virus spread. Furthermore, latest antigen rapid tests still require 15-30 min processing time and are challenging to handle. Despite increased polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-test and antigen-test efforts, the pandemic continues to evolve worldwide. Herein, we developed a superfast, reagent-free, and nondestructive approach of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with subsequent chemometric analysis toward the prescreening of virus-infected samples. Contrived saliva samples spiked with inactivated gamma-irradiated COVID-19 virus particles at levels down to 1582 copies/mL generated infrared (IR) spectra with a good signal-to-noise ratio. Predominant virus spectral peaks are tentatively associated with nucleic acid bands, including RNA. At low copy numbers, the presence of a virus particle was found to be capable of modifying the IR spectral signature of saliva, again with discriminating wavenumbers primarily associated with RNA. Discrimination was also achievable following ATR-FTIR spectral analysis of swabs immersed in saliva variously spiked with virus. Next, we nested our test system in a clinical setting wherein participants were recruited to provide demographic details, symptoms, parallel RT-qPCR testing, and the acquisition of pharyngeal swabs for ATR-FTIR spectral analysis. Initial categorization of swab samples into negative versus positive COVID-19 infection was based on symptoms and PCR results (n = 111 negatives and 70 positives). Following training and validation (using n = 61 negatives and 20 positives) of a genetic algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (GA-LDA) algorithm, a blind sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 89% was achieved. This prompt approach generates results within 2 min and is applicable in areas with increased people traffic that require sudden test results such as airports, events, or gate controls.	false
0	Potential bangle (Zingiber montanum J.Konig) rhizome extract as a supplement to prevent and reduce symptoms of Covid-19. The morbidity and mortality rates due to Covid-19 are increasing day by day, to overcome this, we urgently need a better treatment strategy, therefore various ways and strategies for this must be pursued. The purpose of the present review is to explain that the rhizome of bangle (Zingiber montanum) has great potential to increase antibodies and reduce symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which also seems suitable for treating Covid-19. Method: This review is looking for the results of scientific research from various sources, regarding the efficacy of bangle (Zingiber montanum) rhizome which is strongly suspected to be able to prevent, and reduce the symptoms that occur in COVID-19. The results showed that the bangle rhizome extract had activity as immunomodulatory, antiviral and reduced symptoms such as what happened in COVID-19. Conclusion : Bangle rhizome extract has dozens of nutritious substances and has multifunctional activities, and it can be postulated that among the benefits of bangle rhizome extract it is able to prevent and reduce symptoms that occur in Covid-19, and preclinical studies and clinical studies are needed to prove this postulate.

0	Molecular determinants and mechanism for antibody cocktail preventing SARS-CoV-2 escape. Antibody cocktails represent a promising approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 escape. The determinants for selecting antibody combinations and the mechanism that antibody cocktails prevent viral escape remain unclear. We compared the critical residues in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) used by multiple neutralizing antibodies and cocktails and identified a combination of two antibodies CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 for preventing viral escape. The two antibodies simultaneously bind to non-overlapping epitopes and independently compete for receptor binding. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escapes from individual antibodies by generating resistant mutations in vitro, but it doesn't escape from the cocktail due to stronger mutational constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding requirements. We also identified a conserved neutralizing epitope shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for antibody CoV2-12. Treatments with CoV2-06 and CoV2-14 individually and in combination confer protection in mice. These findings provide insights for rational selection and mechanistic understanding of antibody cocktails as candidates for treating COVID-19.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).	false

0	Deregulated cellular circuits driving immunoglobulins and complement consumption associate with the severity of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for the outcome of COVID-19. We investigated whether the specific immune responses in the peripheral blood of 276 patients were associated with the severity and progression of COVID-19. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B, and NK cells is associated with severity. Conversely, the proportion of B cells, plasmablasts, circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) and CD56-CD16+ NK-cells increased. Regarding humoral immunity, levels of IgM, IgA, and IgG were unaffected, but when degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients. Compared to healthy donors, complement C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, while the activation peptide of C5 (C5a) increased from the admission in every patient, regardless of their severity. Moreover, total IgG, the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes, and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, associating severity with an imbalanced humoral response, and identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	The impact of covid19 pandemic on neuromyelitisoptica spectrum disorder patients in Isfahan, Iran. Background: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has created a global pandemic with high mortality. People with underlying medical conditions and immune system suppression are more prone to severe infection. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a potentially disabling disease that is treated by immunosuppressive drugs. The nature of disease as well as its treatment potentially predisposes patients to various infections, including Covid-19 infection. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical course of NMOSD patients and to assess the level of anxiety and fear in them as well as to evaluate the characteristics of Covid-19 infection in patients with NMOSD. We report some cases of COVID19 infection among our patients. Methods and Materials: A descriptive study was done in 140 patients (116 female and 24 male) in NMOSD Cohort clinic of Kashani hospital, Isfahan, Iran. All patients were contacted by telephone and were asked about their infection with the Coronavirus and their treatment during its outbreak. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire were filled out via phone calls to assess patients' anxiety in pandemic. Result(s): The study included 140 patients (43 seropositive). Their mean age was 36.83+/-9.82 and mean duration of disease was 8.06+/-5.09 years. They experienced overall 43 relapses within the last year (ARR:0.3) and 9 relapses during COVID19 epidemic (ARR:0.19). A total of 112 patients (80%) experienced anxiety or fear during the pandemic period. Six patients infected by COVID- 19 and one of them experienced ICU admission. There was neither death nor serious complication nor atypical presentation of COVID19. All six patients were treated by rituximab and the prevalence of COVID-19 was 4.8% in patients taking rituximab . The mean age of these 6 patients was 37.80+/-17.72 and the disease duration was 7.20+/-3.27 years. There was not statistical difference between the mean age of infected patients and that of the rest of NMOSD population. Of the 124 patients treated with Rituximab, 32 cases postponed their treatment due to fear of infection and hospitalization. (1.95+/-1.16 months delay averagely). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that in our NMOSD patients, in spite of suppression of the immune system, neither incidence nor the serious complication of covid-19 infection was high. Therefore, regarding the disabling nature of NMOSD as well as prolonged epidemic period, it may be reasonable to continue the routine treatment of these patients along with more training of patients to stick to health protection instructions. We also found that patients with NMOSD are more prone to anxiety and fear of pandemic.	false
0	How IvIg Can Mitigate Covid-19 Disease: A Symmetrical Immune Network Model. In this report we provide a hypothesis of how intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) (pooled therapeutic normal IgG) mitigates the severe disease after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The disease is caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system producing a cytokine storm and inflicting multiple organ damage. Our interpretation of IvIg therapy hinges on a recent analysis of the immune dysregulation in Covid-19 infection.(1) Previous infections with common cold coronavirus induce suppressor memory B cells that inhibit an immune response to Covid-19. The repertoire of natural antibodies (IvIg) contains suppressing antibodies in a symmetrically balanced network structure. When this repertoire interacts with the imbalanced network in the infected patient, it can neutralize the suppression of an antibody response against Covid-19. The described scenario for IvIg in Covid-19 infection may also apply in the therapy of autoimmune diseases.(2).	false
0	Incidence of acute kidney injury and provision of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Introduction: Amongst patients admitted to intensive care (ICU) with COVID-19 the reported incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) ranges from 3% to 66%.[1] In the United Kingdom (UK) 26% of patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 required renal replacement therapy (RRT).[2] At our institution RRT in ICU is usually exclusively provided as Continuous Veno-Venous HaemoDiaFiltration (CVVHDF). During early stages of the pandemic it became apparent that demand for RRT - driven by a surge in ICU admissions, high rates of AKI and shorter than usual filter lifespan - threatened our ability to provide timely organ support to critically ill patients with COVID-19, a situation that was being replicated globally.[3] During the first 2 months of the pandemic in the UK we introduced a number of measures designed to extend our ability to provide RRT, including introduction of acute peritoneal dialysis (aPD) and intermittent haemodialysis (IHD). Objective(s): To describe the incidence of AKI in patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 at a large teaching hospital in London, UK. To evaluate how the introduction of alternative modalities of RRT (aPD and IHD) - not usually offered in our ICU - were able to reduce dependence on CVVHDF. To report any complications associated with using aPD and IHD in these critically ill patients. Method(s): We carried out a retrospective review of patients' electronic medical records as part of a departmental service evaluation (ref: KCC06052020AIA). We recorded baseline demographics, incidence of AKI (defined using KDIGO serum creatinine criteria) [4] and details regarding RRT received and complications of RRT for all patients admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 10/03/2020 (date of first patient admitted with COVID-19) and 10/05/2020. Result(s): 177 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU. Excluding patients who were transferred from other institutions (n = 34) and patients with established End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD, n = 7) the incidence of AKI was 79%. Most (86%) developed severe (stage 3) AKI. 63% of patients required RRT, which was initiated a median of 4.5 (IQR 2-7) days after ICU admission. As of 16/06/2020, of patients who developed severe AKI, 49% had died, 8% were still admitted to the ICU, 22% had been discharged from the ICU but were still in hospital and 22% had been discharged home. Almost all ICU survivors hadrecovered renal function to the point of being free of RRT (95%). Median duration of RRT in those who recovered was 21 (IQR 13-29) days. Peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion was attempted in 41 patients and successful in 34 (83%). 15 patients (44%) were subsequently exclusively treated with aPD, whilst 19 required some supplemental CVVHDF. Common reasons for reverting to CVVHDF included: clinical deterioration not attributed to PD (n = 5); elevated urea (n = 5); fluid overload (n = 4); hyperkalaemia (n = 3). No patients were reported to have had deterioration in ventilatory parameters or peritonitis. A reverse osmosis (RO) plant was installed within the ICU on 18/04/20, and IHD began on 20/04/20. 82 HD sessions were delivered to 15 patients. Transient hypotension was reported during 11 sessions (13.4%). On one occasion the session was terminated due to marked hypotension. At the start of the pandemic 100% of RRT was delivered as CVVHDF. With the introduction of aPD and IHD this fell to a nadir of 39%. During the study period a total of 463 patient days of CVVHDF were replaced with either aPD or IHD. Conclusion(s): In our study most patients admitted to ICU with COVID- 19 developed severe AKI. It was only possible to provide RRT to these patients by expanding the range of RRT modalities offered to include aPD and IHD. Through close collaboration between the critical care and nephrology departments this was achieved rapidly, effectively and with no serious adverse events during pandemic conditions.	false
0	Meta-Analysis of Robustness of COVID-19 Diagnostic Kits During Early Pandemic. <h4>Background: </h4> Accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is necessary to mitigate the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the test reagents and assay platforms are varied and may not be sufficiently robust to diagnose COVID-19. Methods We reviewed 85 studies (21,530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic, following the standards outlined in the PRISMA statement. All relevant articles, published up to May 31, 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv, and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10,355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5,538 patients) between methods in meta-analyses. Results The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1,957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1,585 had positive serum antibody (IgM +/- IgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95%CI 0.66-.90). While 3,509 of 3581 participants RT-PCR negative for COVID-19 were found negative by serology testing (specificity 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-0.99). The chemiluminescent immunoassay exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. Serology tests had higher sensitivity and specificity for laboratory-approval than for real-world reporting data. Conclusions The robustness of the assays/platforms is influenced by variability in sampling and reagents. Serological testing complements and may minimize false negative RT-PCR results. Lack of standardized assay protocols in the early phase of pandemic might have contributed to the spread of COVID-19.	false
0	Immunisation, asymptomatic infection, herd immunity and the new variants of COVID-19. <h4>Objectives: </h4> Is herd immunity to COVID-19 a realistic outcome of any immunisation programme with the two main vaccines currently licenced in the UK (Pfizer vaccine BNT162b2 and Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine ChAdOx1-S)? More formally, can these vaccines achieve a sufficient level of population immunity to reduce R, the reproduction number of the infection, to below one in the absence of any non-pharmaceutical interventions? Design The study uses simple mathematical models of the transmission of COVID-19 infection from primary to secondary cases parameterised using data on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy from the literature and the regulatory approval process for the vaccines. Results In the regulatory approval documents, the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is estimated at 0.948 (that for the Moderna vaccine is similar). Efficacy for the Oxford vaccine against primary symptomatic illness is estimated as 0.704, based on pooling of data from two dose regimes. For values of R0 similar to those reported during the first months of the pandemic, the simplest analysis implies that reducing the value of R below 1 would require 69% and 93% of the population to be vaccinated with the Pfizer and Oxford vaccine respectively (or achieve a comparable level of immunity through natural infection). However, the new variant of COVID-19 (Lineage B.1.1.7, named Variant of Concern VOC-202012/01) is reported to have an R-value 1.56 (0.92 to 2.28) times higher than the original strain. Vaccinating the entire population with the Oxford vaccine would only reduce the R value to 1.325 while the Pfizer vaccine would require 82% of the population to be vaccinated to control the spread of the new variant. The Oxford vaccine reduces the incidence of serious illness to a greater extent than it reduces symptomatic illness. But its efficacy against the incidence of asymptomatic infections is lower, reducing its efficacy against all infection from 0.704 to 0.525 for the pooled data. Although asymptomatics are less infectious, including them in our calculations still raises R values by 20% or more, from 1.33 to 1.6 for the new variant with 100% vaccination. Neither vaccine is licenced for use in children, and when this is taken into account, this R value rises by a further 37% to 2.2 if the whole adult population is vaccinated. Even the more effective mRNA vaccines may allow the pandemic to persist via transmission amongst children, as current authorisations only allow their use on adults. In the absence of vaccination, R will reduce to 1 when 89% of the population has acquired immunity as a result of previous infection with COVID-19. Conclusions All currently licensed vaccines provide substantial protection against serious illness to vaccinated individuals themselves. But the Oxford vaccine appears to have relatively low efficacy against asymptomatic infections. Although no comparable data from human trials are available for the mRNA vaccines, non-human primate studies suggest they are better at preventing nasal shedding and so transmission. Herd immunity to COVID-19 will be very difficult to achieve, especially so for the less effective vaccine. The possibility of transmission from vaccinated but infected individuals to vulnerable unvaccinated individuals is of serious concern. There is a strong case for preferring the more effective mRNA vaccines for health and social care workers and those who have contact with large numbers of vulnerable others.	false

0	Comparison and analysis of various complementary diagnosis methods for the current situation and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis. We evaluated and compared the diagnostic performance of fluorescence immunoassay (FIA) and two types of serological diagnostic tests: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody to diagnose COVID-19 infections. This study is aimed to analyze and compare the current status and problems of COVID-19 diagnosis and various alternative diagnostic methods that are viable. The enrolled subjects in our study population were tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ELISA and immunochromatographic diagnostic kit were used to diagnose 362 positive and 3010 negative SARS-CoV-2 specimens, and antigen fluorescence immunoassay kit was used on 62 positive and 70 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed samples for diagnosis. As a result, categorizing by the patient symptom onset days, PCL COVID19 Total Ab EIA (ELISA) showed the sensitivity of 93.4% from 15 to 21 days, 94.2% from over 22 days, and the specificity of 99.97%. PCL COVID19 IgG/IgM Rapid Gold (ICA) had a sensitivity of 86.9%, 97.4%, and the specificity of 98.14% respectively. PCL COVID19 Ag Rapid FIA sensitivity was 93.8% from 0 to 7 days, 71.4% from 8 to 12 days and specificity was 98.57%. In conclusion, COVID-19 Ab ELISA and ICA, and COVID-19 Ag FIA are all complementary and applicable diagnostic methods to resolve the current problems of COVID-19 diagnosis.	false
0	Overall reduced lymphocyte especially T and B subsets closely related to the poor prognosis and the disease severity in severe patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND: A dysregulated host immune response is common in patients with COVID-19., AIM: In this study, we aimed to define the characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and their relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM)., METHODS: The baseline peripheral lymphocyte subsets were compared between 55 healthy controls and 95 patients with confirmed COVID-19, and between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients with or without DM., RESULTS: The prevalence of DM in the COVID-19 group was 20%, and patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of DM than those with non-severe disease (P = 0.006). Moreover, a significantly poor prognosis and a higher rate of severity were found in those with DM relative to those without DM (P = 0.001, 0.003). Generally, all lymphocytes and subsets of lymphocytes, especially B and T cells, were significant reduced in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with DM. Patients with severe COVID-19 and DM had the lowest lymphocyte counts compared with those with severe COVID-19 without DM, and those with non-severe COVID-19 with or without DM. Partially decreased lymphocyte subsets, age and DM were closely related to disease progression and prognosis., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a reference for clinicians that immunomodulatory treatment may improve disease progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease with DM.

0	Current smoking and COVID-19 risk: Results from a population symptom app in over 2.4 million people. Background: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap. Method(s): UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, and were asked to log their condition daily. Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of a  classic' symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers. Result(s): Between 24 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, data were available on 2 401 982 participants, mean (SD) age 43.6 (15.1) years, 63.3% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0%. 834 437 (35%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to report symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.14 (1.10 to 1.18); >5 symptoms 1.29 (1.26 to 1.31); >10 symptoms 1.50 (1.42 to 1.58). The pattern of association between reported symptoms did not vary between smokers and non-smokers. Interpretation(s): These data are consistent with people who smoke being at an increased risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen from serum can aid in timing of COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in respiratory samples for weeks or even months after onset of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, one of the diagnostic challenges of PCR positive cases is differentiating between acute COVID-19 disease and convalescent phase. Recently, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in serum samples of COVID-19 patients was published [Le Hingrat et al. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives, Clinical Microbiology and Infection , 2020]. Our study aimed to characterize the analytical specificity and sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Salocor SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Quantitative Assay Kit © (Salofa Ltd, Salo, Finland)) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in serum, and to characterize the kinetics of antigenemia. The evaluation material included a negative serum panel of 155 samples, and 126 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. The specificity of the Salocor SARS-CoV-2 serum N antigen test was 98.0%. In comparison with simultaneous positive PCR from upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens, the test sensitivity was 91.7%. In a serum panel in which the earliest serum sample was collected two days before the collection of positive URT specimen, and the latest 48 days after (median 1 day post URT sample collection), the serum N antigen test sensitivity was 94% within 14 days post onset of symptoms. The antigenemia resolved approximately two weeks after the onset of disease and diagnostic PCR. The combination of simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody testing appeared to provide useful information for the timing of COVID-19. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia may be used as a diagnostic marker in acute COVID-19.	false
0	Spatial distribution characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with environmental factors. Investigating the spatial distribution characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and exploring the influence of environmental factors that drive it is the basis for formulating rational and efficient prevention and control countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with the environmental factors. Based on the incidences of new local COVID-19 cases in Beijing from June 11 to July 5, the spatial clustering characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing was investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The relation between COVID-19 cases and environmental factors was assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explore the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the development of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing from June 11 to July 5 could be divided into two stages. The first stage was the outward expansion from June 11 to June 21, and the second stage (from June 22 to July 5) was the growth of the transmission in areas with existing previous cases. In addition, there was a ring of low value clusters around the Xinfadi market. This area was the key area for prevention and control. Population density and distance to Xinfadi market were the most critical factors that explained the pandemic development. The findings of this study can provide useful information for the global fighting against COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Retinal imaging study diagnoses in COVID-19: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hyperreflective lesions at the level of ganglion cell (GCL) and inner plexiform retinal layers (IPL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cotton wool spots in the examination of the eye fundus have recently been described as findings in patients with COVID-19 infection., CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old healthy Caucasian male anesthetist who had treated COVID-19 patients during the previous 5 weeks and suddenly presented with a temporal relative scotoma in his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the left eye, and no discromatopsy or afferent pupillary defect was present. Visual field test was performed, with no significant findings associated with the focal loss of sensitivity described by the patient. The anterior segment was unremarkable on slit lamp examination in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed no significant findings. A placoid, hyperreflective band at the level of the GCL and IPL was visible in OCT which spared the outer retina, at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later. An oropharyngeal swab test was performed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative. ELISA testing and a third rapid antibody detection test performed 7 days after the onset of symptoms were positive., CONCLUSIONS: Ocular signs and symptoms in COVID-19 cases are rarely reported, but may be underestimated, especially those that affect the retina and occur in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases. We present a case of COVID-19 diagnosis based on retinal ophthalmic examination.	false
0	Association between laboratory parameters and CT severity in patients infected with Covid-19: A retrospective, observational study. INTRODUCTION: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have presented to emergency departments (EDs) worldwide with a wide range of symptoms. In this study we reported the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19., METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study. The patients who have admitted to ED between March 11 and May 31, 2020 and diagnosed COVID-19 infection., RESULTS: 130 (73 male and 57 female) patients with COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive test were included in the study. The average age of the study group was calculated as 52.63 +/- 17.95 year. While 15.4% of the patients were asymptomatic, the most common symptom was identified as cough (46.2%), followed by dyspnea (23.1%), fever (17.7%). The computed tomography (CT) severity scores proved significantly higher in the patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) than in those without these diseases (p = 0.010 and p = 0.042, respectively). The moderate positive correlation between serum ferritin level and CT severity score is another finding worth noting (rho = 0.530 and p = 0.0001). In a similar vein, the high level of D-dimer in the CT-positive group and its positive moderate correlation with CT severity (rho = 0.375 and p = 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: In our study, serum ferritin and D-dimer levels were observed to be high in the CT-positive group and have moderate positive correlation with CT severity. We thus argue that D-dimer and ferritin levels measured at the time of admission to the ED can be taken into consideration to predict radiological severity. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including autoimmune features and autoantibody production. We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50% of patients, but in <15% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in ∼25% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed de novo following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 causes development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies in a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are positively correlated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.	false
0	Biosensors as a future diagnostic approach for COVID-19. Due to the importance of detection of diseases and viruses, several techniques have been introduced for detecting process. Currently, biosensors provide an important device clinical diagnostics, food processing and environmental monitoring for detection of various analytes specially viruses. These biosensors provide a rapid and effective devises for qualitative and quantitative detection of infectious diseases in real-time. Here, we report the development of biosensors based on various techniques. Additionally, we will also explain the mechanisms, advantages and disadvantages of the most common biosensors that is currently used for viral detection which could be optical (e.g. surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)) and electrochemical biosensors. Based on that, in this review, it has been recommends methods for efficient, simple, low-cost and rapid detecting SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (COVID-19) that employ the two types of biosensors depending on attaching hemoglobin beta-chain and binding of specific antibodies with COVID-19 antigens respectively.

0	Is prognostic nutritional index a predictive marker for estimating all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular risk factors?. BACKGROUND: This study examined the possible association between the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and in-hospital mortality rates in cases with a high cardiovascular risk burden and hospitalized with the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 294 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary referral pandemic center. The study cohort was grouped into tertiles based on the initial PNI values as T1, T2, and T3. The PNI was calculated for each case and the prognostic value of this index was compared to CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality., RESULTS: Patients stratified into the T1 tertile had a lower lymphocyte count, serum albumin level, and PNI values. In a multivariate analysis, the PNI (OR: 0.688,%95CI: 0.586-0.808, p < 0.001) was an independent predictor for all-cause in-hospital death. After adjusting for confounding independent parameters, patients included in the T1 tertile were found to have 11.2 times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to the T3 group, which was presumed as the reference group. In addition, we found that the area under curve (AUC) value of PNI was significantly elevated than that of serum albumin level and total lymphocyte counts alone. [(AUC):0.79 vs AUC:0.75 vs AUC:0.69; respectively)., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNI is independently related with in-hospital mortality in patient with COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors. The power of the PNI was also validated using well-accepted risk scores of COVID-19 such as CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	A high-throughput Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing platform for COVID-19. Background: Serology tests for detecting the antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can identify previous infection and help to confirm the presence of current infection. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody detection. Results: Clinical agreement studies were performed in 107 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 226 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 46.15 % (95 % CI: 19.22 %-74.87 %), 61.54 % (95 % CI: 31.58 %-86.14 %), and 97.53 % (95 % CI: 91.36 %-99.70 %) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and >= 15 days from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 98.23 % (95 % CI: 95.53 %-99.52 %). No cross-reactivity was observed to patient samples positive for IgG antibodies against the following pathogens: HIV, HAV, HBV, RSV, CMV, EBV, Rubella, Influenza A, and Influenza B. Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. Conclusion: An anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing.	false
0	Evaluation of a Commercial Culture-free Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus-2 and Comparison with an Anti-RBD ELISA Assay. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assays that bypass the need for viral culture offer substantial advantages regarding throughput and cost. The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (Genscript) is the first such commercially available assay, detecting antibodies that block RBD/ACE-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared to anti-RBD ELISA assays. <h4>Methods</h4> Serum reference panels were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Results</h4> Compared to PRNT-50%, cPass had 100% sensitivity (95%CI 82-100) and 95% specificity (76-100). Sensitivity was also very high compared to the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, but specificity was lower, ranging from 17-70%. Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG ( r =0.851 at 0-6 weeks; r =0.798 at > 6 weeks). Anti-RBD IgG diagnostic accuracy for detection of neutralizing antibodies was essentially identical to that of cPass. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The added value of cPass compared to an IgG anti-RBD ELISA was not supported by these results.	false

0	Conducting a conventional multi-casualty incident in COVID-19 personal protective equipment - a semi-structured interview. BACKGROUND: The risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare professionals is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) presents a number of potential challenges to responders that may impact upon the management of patients in a multi-casualty incident. This report describes a multi-agency multi-casualty incident. It identifies learning points specifically related to the challenges of conducting a conventional multi-casualty incident in COVID-19 PPE., CASE: The multi casualty incident in Reading, UK on the 20 June 2020 involved six stab injury victims and was attended by four pre-hospital critical care teams. This was the first conventional multi-casualty incident that pre-hospital critical care teams had attended during the COVID-19 era and it was conducted in COVID-19 PPE (1). The scene was an urban park where three patients were confirmed to be in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest (TCA) from stab wounds and another three patients had also suffered stab injuries. By the time the incident had concluded three patients were pronounced dead at the scene. Two patients were transported to the local trauma unit and one patient was transported to the regional Major Trauma Centre depending on the severity of their injuries., CONCLUSIONS: We conducted a semi structured telephone interview with the critical care clinicians who were involved in the incident. The interviews focused specifically on the challenges of responding whilst wearing COVID-19 PPE, rather than the wider challenges of responding to such an incident. The key learning points identified were: Improving the identifiability of clinicians in level 3 PPE wearing identification tabards using visible labelling on PPE suits Improving communication by radio using a belt to carry the radio using an earpiece and push to talk system. Training in conducting multi casualty incidents in level 3 PPE.	false
0	Characterization of 100 sequential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations. Background: Transfusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent plasma is a promising treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with success of the intervention based on neutralizing antibody content. Measurement by serologic correlates without biocontainment needs as well as an understanding of donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate effective collection. Study Design and Methods: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Donor demographics such as COVID-19 severity, age, and sex were correlated with antibody titers. Result(s): A mean neutralization titer 50% of 230 (range, <8-1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (P <.0001) yet quantitatively limited (R2 = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>500) from analysis improved correlation (R2 = 0.5386). A tendency of higher-titer plasma units from donors with increased disease severity, of advanced age, and of male sex was seen, yet the functional relevance of this difference is questionable. Conclusion(s): The ELISA-based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower-titer units from the clinical supply for COVID-19 treatment. Disease severity may be associated with the development of higher titers of neutralizing antibodies, although larger case numbers will be needed for additional confirmation.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Management of children with rheumatic diseases in covid-19 outbreak in the tertiary pediatric rheumatology center in Iran. Introduction: The COVID-19 disease identified and reported from Wuhan, Hubei, China. At the time being, the disease is a pandemic and has involved the entire world. Objective(s): The aim of this study is reporting the planning and actions after the COVID-19 epidemic for prevention of spread of the disease, supporting patients, and managing the disease at our center's outpatient clinic as a referral center for children suffering rheumatic diseases. Method(s): Since the first report of disease, we tried to reply to the patients' questions in a virtual social network. We were following lab data, radiograms, sonograms, CT scans, and MRI results in this network and provided solutions for the management of the children's problems without need to encountering. Result(s): In cases that were controlled and their diseases were in remission, we invited one of the patient's parents to come and receive the prescriptions. We put some instructive short films about COVID-19 in the virtual network and in LED screens of our outpatient hospital clinic to provide useful information. About the turn rating system (queuing system) we omitted manual turn-taking stands to prevent virus transmission. In the peak of the epidemic, we stopped outpatient clinics for three weeks. After that, we started clinics with the least number of patients and the most standard protection measures for physicians, patients, and other staff. All people were triaged in the hospital yard before entering the waiting hall of the clinic by taking their temperature and screening questions. If they didn't have a fever and symptoms compatible with the disease, we let the patient and only one compeer enter the clinic hall with giving a free three-layer surgical mask to each of them. We requested the physicians to increase the time of their clinics to distance the appointments of the patients and to prevent overcrowding in the clinic. Each clinic was held with the presence of the attending physician and only one fellow physician. Gowns, protective glasses and face shields, surgical masks, and latex gloves were provided for secretaries and the other staff in the clinic. In the first eight weeks, daily disinfection was performed for all the surfaces of the clinic and after that, a disinfecting tunnel at the door of the clinic was added. With the screening of about 100 staff in the clinic, we found only one IgM positive person for COVID-19 during the first eight weeks who was one of the secretaries without any signs and symptoms and were quarantined at home. Among the physicians, 6 of them (8 percent) developed COVID-19 disease with laboratory confirmation. All of the involved physicians were working in the private section as well as a state-run system. From about 200 patients with different rheumatic diseases came to the clinic in eight weeks, 11 of them (5.5%) were in the relapse of their disease which in comparison to the same time in the last year, 26 from 760 patients (3%), a remarkable increase (almost double) is seen for which different causes can be considered. Most of the patients who came to the clinic in the COVID-19 outbreak were those who had to come due to the severity of their disease. In the patients who came before the epidemic, the most causes were musculoskeletal pains such as hypermobility and skeletal benign reasons and rheumatic diseases were in the next rank but in the epidemic outbreak, the prior group came in a lower number. Follow up on the patients after the epidemic will reveal this matter better. Conclusion(s): Employing personal and patient protective equipments, patients' triage, postponement of face-to-face appointments, social distancing, telemedicine, and using the virtual social networks may be effective policies in outpatient clinics in the COVID-19 outbreak.	false

0	Increased levels of ferritin on admission predicts intensive care unit mortality in patients with COVID-19. Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate hyperferritinemia could be a predicting factor of mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): A total of 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled and classified into moderate (n = 17), severe (n = 40) and critical groups (n = 43). Clinical information and laboratory results were collected and the concentrations of ferritin were compared among different groups. The association between ferritin and mortality was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicting value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Result(s): The amount of ferritin was significantly higher in critical group compared with moderate and severe groups. The median of ferritin concentration was about three times higher in death group than survival group (1722.25 mug/L vs. 501.90 mug/L, p < 0.01). The concentration of ferritin was positively correlated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ferritin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Especially, high-ferritin group was associated with higher incidence of mortality, with adjusted odds ratio of 104.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.63-4185.89; p = 0.013]. Moreover, ferritin had an advantage of discriminative capacity with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.822 (95% CI 0.737-0.907) higher than procalcitonin and CRP. Conclusion(s): The ferritin measured at admission may serve as an independent factor for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 in ICU.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.	false
0	The Cytokine Profiles and Immune Response Are Increased in COVID-19 Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The induction of inflammation and cytokine storm was proposed to play a critical role in COVID-19. This study is aimed at investigating the relationship between glucose metabolism and the inflammatory state of inpatients with COVID-19. 71 inpatients with COVID-19 were classified into nondiabetes mellitus (NDM) group, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) group, and diabetes mellitus (DM) group. The average hospitalization days were significantly shorter in DM patients when compared with patients in the IFG group and NDM group. CD4+ T cell percentage was higher while CD8+ T cells percentage was lower in the DM group than those in the NDM group. The serum levels of IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, and INF-gamma in the DM group were upregulated when compared with those in the NDM group. The serum levels of TNF-, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and INF-gamma were significantly higher in the DM group than those in the IFG group. A significant difference was observed in CD4+ T cell, CD4+/CD8+ ratio percentage, IL-6, and IL-10 between the NDM group and DM group with adjusted BMI. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with elevated glucose levels have promoted cytokine profiles and immune response.Copyright © 2021 Mao Zheng et al.	false

0	Human SARS CoV-2 spike protein mutations. The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID-19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 A interacting distance from the ACE-2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three-dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

0	Prevalence and 30-Day Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Covid-19 and Prior Lung Diseases. Introduction: Patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases in the setting of COVID-19 may have a greater risk of severe complications and even death. Method(s): A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study with 5847 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. Patients were separated in two groups, with/without previous lung disease. Evaluation of factors associated with survival and secondary composite end-point such as ICU admission and respiratory support, were explored. Result(s): 1,271 patients (22%) had a previous lung disease, mostly COPD. All-cause mortality occurred in 376 patients with lung disease (29.5%) and in 819 patients without (17.9%) (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with lung diseases had a worse 30-day survival (HR = 1.78; 95%C.I. 1.58-2.01; p < 0.001) and COPD had almost 40% mortality. Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior lung disease remained a risk factor for mortality (HR, 1.21; 95%C.I. 1.02-1.44; p = 0.02). Variables independently associated with all-cause mortality risk in patients with lung diseases were oxygen saturation less than 92% on admission (HR, 4.35; 95% CI 3.08-6.15) and elevated D-dimer (HR, 1.84; 95% CI 1.27-2.67). Age younger than 60 years (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.65) was associated with decreased risk of death. Conclusion(s): Previous lung disease is a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Older age, male gender, home oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure on admission were associated with an increased mortality. Efforts must be done to identify respiratory patients to set measures to improve their clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020 SEPAR	false
0	Glycemic parameters in patients with new-onset diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic are more severe than in patients with new-onset diabetes before the pandemic: NOD COVID India Study. Background and aims: It is not known if new onset diabetes during Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19; NOD COVID) is phenotypically or biochemically different than new onset diabetes before COVID-19 (NOD). Method(s): All adults diagnosed with new onset diabetes from during the time of COVID-19 were compared with new onset diabetes prior to COVID-19 from two tertiary care hospitals in Chennai and Delhi. RTPCR test for SARS-CoV-2 virus was done as appropriate, and COVID-19 antibody test was done in all other NOD COVID patients. Result(s): A total of 555 patients with new onset diabetes were included in the study (282 NOD and 273 NOD COVID patients). Patients with NOD COVID had higher fasting and post prandial blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels vs. NOD patients. Both the groups had high average body mass index; ~28 kg/m2. Interestingly, fasting C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the NOD COVID group vs. NOD group. There was no difference in C-peptide levels or glycemic parameters between the COVID-19 antibody positive and negative NOD COVID cases. Conclusion(s): Individuals who were diagnosed with diabetes during COVID-19 epidemic (NOD COVID) do not significantly differ from those diagnosed before COVID-19 in symptomatology, phenotype, and C-peptide levels but they had more severe glycemia.Copyright © 2021 Diabetes India	false
0	Pneumonia surveillance and its attendant clinical risk stratification for COVID-19 in low-risk patients. Objectives: The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 in the context of a secondary pneumonia surveillance program targeted at low-risk patients and to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19. Study design: This study design is a retrospective cohort study. Method(s): This study is conducted in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, a University affiliated 1600-bed public hospital in Singapore. Patients with pneumonia admitted under our Enhanced Pneumonia Surveillance (EPS) program from 7 February 2020 to 20 March 2020 were included. Relevant clinical variables were collated. Result(s): Of 1295 patients admitted under our EPS program, 47 (3.6%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of a radiologist-reported normal chest X-ray (CXR) in the COVID-19-positive group was 62.8% compared with 6.2% in the COVID-19-negative group. In patients with a normal CXR, a low normal white blood cell (WBC) count and minimal C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation were associated with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The pick-up rate of COVID-19 in low-risk patients with pneumonia is 3.6%. However, at least 7.9% of patients who were isolated had a normal CXR. For patients with pneumonia-like illness at presentation but a normal CXR, higher WBC and CRP values may guide early deisolation. Ultimately, this informs resource allocation for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinical services.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health	false
0	The new world 2020: A crucial paradigm for meeting fast changing world demands in pakistan after covid-19 outbreak. The waves of COVID-19 has shaken the world and bring about many changes in society. The changed environment or new world 2020 after COVID-19 pandemic demand high quality protection in all arena of life. The most important arena that require significant changes have been divided into four categories. First of all, the high mental health issues and low mental health services in Pakistan are not sufficient to control the mental health problem ratio. There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems. Fourthly the provision of mental health support for children is a key area that needs considerable attention after pandemic or crises. The study has contemporary significance as disasters, crises and communicable disease has been prevalent throughout human history and may attack the world at any time in the future.Copyright © 2020 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb.

0	Clinical predictors of poor outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease and COVID-19 infection. We aimed to identify predictors of outcomes and survival in patients living in 4 major metropolitan areaswhohad sickle cell disease (SCD) and COVID-19 to inform best approaches to prevention and care. Data were collected at baseline and during the clinical course in SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in four COVID-19 epicenters. Patients were followed up posthospital discharge for up to 3 months. Of sixty-six SCD patients with COVID-19, fifty patients (75%) required hospitalization, and seven died (10.6%). Patients with preexisting kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) were more likely to be hospitalized. The most common presenting symptom was vaso-occlusive pain. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 30 (60%) of the 50 hospitalized patients and in all who died. Older age and histories of pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and stroke were more prevalent in patients who died, as were higher creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer levels. Anticoagulation use while inpatient was twice less common in patients who died. All deaths occurred in individuals not taking hydroxyurea or any other SCD-modifying therapy. Patients with SCD and COVID-19 exhibited a broad range of disease severity. We cannot definitively state that the overall mortality is higher in patients with SCD, although our case fatality rate was ;10% compared with ;3% in the general population, despite a median age of 34 years. Individuals with SCD aged.50 years, with preexisting cardiopulmonary, renal disease, and/or stroke not receiving hydroxyurea, who present with high serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer levels, are at higher risk of death, irrespective of genotype or sex.

0	DNA aptamers in COVID-19 research. Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), a variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) family has claimed around 1 million lives and more than 33 million people worldwide have been infected. It has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is transmitted mainly through aerosol droplets from patients (both asymptomatic and symptomatic) to healthy people. Its high rate of transmission demands a quick and early diagnosis of patients followed by urgent quarantine of those affected. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mutating, it is of utmost importance to develop a quick diagnosis against it. The current techniques use either PCR-based methods or antibody-based ELISA methods for diagnosis, which are both time-consuming and expensive. This is the biggest impediment in large-scale diagnosis of COVID-19. Multiple biosensors based on antibodies and aptamers have been reported and tested. Aptamers seem much more lucrative due to ease of synthesis, cost-effectiveness and extremely high degree of sensitivity in terms of detection, less immunogenicity and robustness to modifications. We present the history and characterization of aptamers, their selection strategies and applications to multiple viruses such as HIV, HCV and SARS-CoV. However, to date, no aptamers have been designed against any of the protein components or the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the success of aptamers against many viruses, we argue for the future exploration of aptamers in the context of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Asymptomatic Patients Hospitalized for Cardiac Emergencies: Implications for Patient Management. Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic imposed diverse challenges on the health care system. Morbidity and mortality of non-COVID-19 emergencies might also have changed because hospitals may not be able to provide optimal care due to restructured resources and uncertainties how to deal with potentially infected patients. It has been recommended to stratify treatment of cardiovascular emergencies according to cardiovascular risk. However, data on the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients presenting with cardiac emergencies remain scarce. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients' data from a tertiary cardiology department between April 15 and May 31, 2020. All patients were screened on admission for COVID-19 symptoms using a questionnaire and body temperature measurements. All hospitalized patients were routinely screened using nasopharyngeal swab testing. Results: In total, we counted 710 urgent and emergency admissions. Nasopharyngeal swab tests were available in 689 (97%) patients, 409 and 280 of which presented as urgent and emergency admissions, respectively. Among 280 emergency admissions, none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: In cardiac emergency patients which were screened negative for COVID-19 symptoms, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in regions with a modest overall prevalence is low. This finding might be helpful to better determine timing of emergency procedures and reasonable usage of protective equipment during the COVID-19 crisis and the future.	false
0	The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election. What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump's vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters' mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. Copyright © Crown 2021.	false

0	Emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 mutations in an immunocompromised host. Prolonged shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 has recently been reported in a number of immunosuppressed individuals with COVID-19. Here, we describe the detection of high levels of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in specimens taken from the respiratory tract of a B-cell depleted patient up to 154 days after initial COVID-19 diagnosis concomitant with the development of high mutation rate. In this patient, a total of 11 nonsynonymous mutations were detected in addition to the Y144 deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Virus evolution studies revealed a dramatic diversification in viral population coinciding with treatment with convalescent plasma and clinical respiratory deterioration. Our findings highlight the urgent need for continuous real-time surveillance of genetic changes of SARS-CoV-2 adaptation alongside immunological investigations in patients with severely compromised humoral responses who may shed infectious virus over prolonged periods of time.	false
0	Study Protocol for DeCOmPRESS: Defining the Disease Course and Immune Profile of COVID-19 in the Immunosuppressed Patient. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current advisory guidelines for high-risk groups—including people with autoimmune disease taking immunosuppressive therapies—are to take increased precautions and avoid any unnecessary contacts. The aim of the DeCOmPRESS study is to define the disease course and immune profile of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients. We will clinically phenotype patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) who develop COVID-19 using a customized REDCap data collection instrument embedded within the Rare Kidney Disease (RKD) Biobank. This dataset will be interoperable with the rheum-COVID, Global Rheumatology Alliance, and SPRINT-SARI datasets, facilitating international data linkage. Acute and convalescent blood samples will be analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA to define the immunophenotype and cytokine profile. Patients will track COVID-19 and AAV symptoms through a bespoke smartphone app. DeCOmPRESS study findings will rapidly inform management of immunosuppressed patients who contract COVID-19 by defining the natural history and immunological manifestations of the disease in these patients. We will also determine whether pre-existing immunosuppressant therapy lessens the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 disease, thereby paradoxically improving rather than worsening clinical outcomes. This protocol document details the procedures for end-to-end completion of the DeCOmPRESS project and is complemented by an associated comprehensive Study Manual (accessible at:  https://www.tcd.ie/medicine/thkc/decompress/ ).	false
0	Safety evaluation of a medical congress held during the COVID-19 pandemic – a prospective cohort. <h4>Background: </h4> Worldwide, scientific congresses are cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, scientific exchange is more important than ever, especially for infectious diseases and infection prevention specialists. Within a prospective cohort of congress attendees, we evaluated the safety concept of the 2020 congress of the Swiss Societies of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Hygiene. Methods The congress was held between September 2nd and 4th 2020 in Geneva (Switzerland), where COVID-19 incidence in the week during the congress was 65 cases /100 000 population within 7 days. A rigorous safety concept was implemented including universal face masking, physical distancing during sessions, and maximal reduction of social events. We invited congress attendees to participate in this prospective cohort and used an anonymized online questionnaire to assess risk perception, risk exposures, symptoms and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 of attendees before, during and after the congress. Dried blood spots were taken from attendees on-site and four weeks later to detect specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and to document seroconversions. Results A total of 365 people attended the congress, thereof 271 healthcare professionals. Of these, 196 (54%) either answered the questionnaire (N = 150) or provided baseline and follow-up blood samples (N = 168). None of the study participants reported a positive PCR result in the 2 weeks after the congress. Five of 168 (3%) participants were seropositive at follow-up, all of which had already been positive at baseline. The safety concept was deemed appropriate by 92% of the study participants and hygiene measures were performed correctly by the vast majority. Conclusion In this prospective cohort of congress attendees, no PCR positive cases or seroconversions could be documented after attending an on-site medical congress. These findings indicate that congresses with a rigorous safety concept may take place, even in areas with moderately-high COVID-19 activity.	false
0	Virtual Screening of Potential AEC2 Inhibitors for COVID-19 from Traditional Chinese Medicine. <h4>Background: </h4> : Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor, plays an important role in viral genome replication and immune response. ACE2 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) could be considered as a promising complementary therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19. However, the active components and action mechanisms that account for its therapeutic effects remain controversial. <h4>Methods: </h4> ACE2 was employed as a target related to COVID-19 to explore the active ingredients from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database. And the PharmMapper database and TCMSP database were used to predict the targets of the compounds. Moreover, the potential therapeutic targets of COVID-19 were acquired by intersection among genes differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients, genes screened from five public databases and genes targeted by active compounds. Finally, molecular docking verification and function analysis were performed. <h4>Result: </h4> s: In this study, puerarin, the common active compound for targeting ACE2 across the five TCMs ( Radix Cyathulae, Flos Puerariac, Radix Bupleuri, Radix Puerariac and Radix Hemerocallis ), was found. Due to the comprehensive analysis, we revealed that puerarin might prevent the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by blocking ACE2, chiefly modulated the T cell immunity and regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine response by affecting TNF, STAT1 and RNASE3. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Taken together, the present study found that puerarin might have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19 through regulation of the immune system, inhibition of inflammation and prevention of virus entry into cells.	false
0	mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 100 million individuals resulting in over two million deaths. Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines 1,2 . These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known 3–5 . Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers 3,5 . Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection 6,7 . However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.	false
0	"[Sorting and detection of COVID-19 by low-dose thoracic CT scan in patients consulting the radiology department of Fann hospital (Dakar-Senegal)]. Introduction: COVID-19 has spread rapidly since its emergence in China and is currently a global health issue. Its definitive diagnosis is made by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. However, this diagnostic test has low sensitivity with delayed results. Hence, thoracic computed tomography represents an interesting alternative. The aims of this study were to assess the frequency of computed tomography (CT) lesions suggestive of COVID-19 and to compare the results of CT and PCR test., Methods: a prospective study carried out over15 working days and involved 47 patients. These patients were recruited based on the presence of at least 2 clinical signs of COVID-19. Chest CT without contrast according to the ""LOW-DOSE"" protocol was performed. A PCR test on nasopharyngeal swabs was done in patients with signs suggestive of COVID on CT. A serological test was performed in case of a discrepancy between the CT and PCR results., Results: thoracic CT was abnormal in 38 patients and normal in 9 patients. Lesions suggestive of COVID-19 have been identified in 32 patients. Two patients had lesions of non-specific pneumonia. Tuberculosis lesions were visualized in 3 patients. One patient had lesions of interstitial pneumonia. The mean DLP was 59 mGy.cm with extremes of 25 and 95 mGy.cm. Ground-glass opacity was present in 100% of COVID-19 suspects on CT. The results of the PCR test were the same than CT in 12 patients. The positive predictive value for CT was 37.5%. In 20 patients with COVID lesions on CT, the PCR test was negative with a false positive rate of 62.5%. In the patients with negative PCR test, 4 had a serological test for COVID-19 and this test was positive in 3., Conclusion: low-dose chest CT can reduce radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients who are at risk of cumulative dose due to repetitive exam. CT can identify lesions suggestive of COVID-19. It also enables the triage of patients by identifying other diagnoses. Copyright: Ibrahima Niang et al."	false
0	Favourable course in a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients infected by SARS-CoV-2: a single-centre experience. The COVID-19 outbreak has had a dramatic impact on the healthcare system due to the rapid, worldwide spread of the virus, highlighting several considerations on the best management of infected patients and also potential risks and prognostic factors in patients with pre-existing chronic diseases exposed to the virus. Neurodegenerative disorders are known to be chronic, disabling diseases that imply a higher vulnerability to infections, and for this reason, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a worse course in these patients. In the present study, we report our experience with 12 patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) who became infected with SARS-Cov-2 due to a COVID-19 outbreak in a care residency, and thus hospitalised in our COVID hospital. Most of the PD patients had a long disease duration and multiple comorbidities even though SARS-CoV-2 manifestations were mild, and none required intensive care. Despite lung conditions, most of our PD patients had mild symptoms: 7 patients were clinically asymptomatic (58.3%); 3 patients had fever, cough, and myalgia (25%) and 2 patients had dyspnoea (16%) that needed high-flow oxygen therapy. Few complications related to PD were seen. All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalisation period of 30 days. Mortality rate during hospitalisation was zero. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not have a poor prognosis in patients with PD. More extensive data and evaluations, however, are needed to confirm our data, and caution is warranted.	false
0	Follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 Positive Subgroup from the Asymptomatic novel CORonavirus iNfection (ACORN) Study. A nested longitudinal study within the Asymptomatic novel CORonavirus iNfection (ACORN) study followed participants with positive nasopharyngeal swab to query for development of symptoms and assess duration of positive RT-PCR test results. Of the 91 participants initially testing positive, 86 participated in follow-up approximately 14 days after study enrollment; of those 86 participants, 19 (22.1%) developed at least one symptom at any time after the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. The median number of days to symptom development after their initial positive test result was 6 (range 1-29 days). No participants reported a SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue or muscle aches (10.5%), headache (9.3%), fever (5.8%), and shortness of breath (5.8%). Of the 78 participants who submitted a nasopharyngeal swab for repeat RT-PCR testing, 17 (21.8%) remained positive at Day 14, 4 of which continued to test positive at Day 28. These findings reinforce the probable role of silent SARS-CoV-2 infections in community transmission, and that reliance on symptom development will miss a large proportion of infections. Broad testing programs not limited to individuals presenting with symptoms are critical for identifying persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ultimately slowing transmission.

0	Serial KL-6 measurements in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV2-induced direct cytopathic effects against type II pneumocytes are suspected to play a role in mediating and perpetuating lung damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum KL-6 behavior in COVID-19 patients to investigate its potential role in predicting clinical course. Sixty patients (median age IQR, 65 (52-69), 43 males), hospitalized for COVID-19 at Siena COVID Unit University Hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Twenty-six patients were selected (median age IQR, 63 (55-71), 16 males); all of them underwent follow-up evaluations, including clinical, radiological, functional, and serum KL-6 assessments, after 6 (t1) and 9 (t2) months from hospital discharge. At t0, KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than those at t1 (760 (311-1218) vs. 309 (210-408) p = 0.0208) and t2 (760 (311-1218) vs 324 (279-458), p = 0.0365). At t0, KL-6 concentrations were increased in patients with fibrotic lung alterations than in non-fibrotic group (755 (370-1023) vs. 305 (225-608), p = 0.0225). Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) analysis showed that basal KL-6 levels showed good accuracy in discriminating patients with fibrotic sequelae radiologically documented (AUC 85%, p = 0.0404). KL-6 concentrations in patients with fibrotic involvement were significantly reduced at t1 (755 (370-1023) vs. 290 (197-521), p = 0.0366) and t2 (755 (370-1023) vs. 318 (173-435), p = 0.0490). Serum concentrations of KL-6 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients may contribute to identify severe patients requiring mechanical ventilation and to predict those who will develop pulmonary fibrotic sequelae in the follow-up.	false
0	Viroinformatics-Based Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Core Proteins for Potential Therapeutic Targets. SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus for which no known effective antiviral drugs are available. In the present study, to accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics-based in silico drug discovery approaches are utilized. We performed multiple sequence alignments of the Spike (S) protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. This provided us with insights into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drugs or specific antibodies. Further, we analyzed the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 core proteins, i.e., S and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), to elucidate how the virus infection can utilize hemoglobin to decrease the blood oxygen level. Moreover, after a comprehensive literature survey, more than 60 antiviral drugs were chosen. The candidate drugs were then ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike and RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The present multidimensional study further advances our understanding of the novel viral molecular targets and potential of computational approaches for therapeutic assessments. The present study can be a steppingstone in the selection of potential drug candidates to be used either as a treatment or as a reference point when designing a new drug/antibody/inhibitory peptide/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Epitope Mapping on Microarrays Highlights Strong Immune-Response to N Protein Region. A workflow for rapid SARS-CoV-2 epitope discovery on peptide microarrays is herein reported. The process started with a proteome-wide screening of immunoreactivity based on the use of a high-density microarray followed by a refinement and validation phase on a restricted panel of probes using microarrays with tailored peptide immobilization through a click-based strategy. Progressively larger, independent cohorts of Covid-19 positive sera were tested in the refinement processes, leading to the identification of immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) protein and Orf1ab polyprotein. A summary study testing 50 serum samples highlighted an epitope of the N protein (region 155-71) providing good diagnostic performance in discriminating Covid-19 positive vs. healthy individuals. Using this epitope, 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity were reached for IgG detection in Covid-19 samples, and no cross-reactivity with common cold coronaviruses was detected. Likewise, IgM immunoreactivity in samples collected within the first month after symptoms onset showed discrimination ability. Overall, epitope 155-171 from N protein represents a promising candidate for further development and rapid implementation in serological tests.	false

0	The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to morbidity in obese and aged mice and is neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination human sera. The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, disproportionally affects the elderly and people with comorbidities like obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus. Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.	false
0	COVID-19: Rapid Antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow assay: a national systematic evaluation for mass-testing. <h4>Background</h4> New lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed by commercial and research organisations around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To support decisions by the UK Government on potential scale-up of mass population testing, we have at their request evaluated the diagnostic performance of a significant number of point-of-care rapid SARS-CoV-2 LFDs. <h4>Methods</h4> 132 LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). <h4>Results</h4> 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics from independent laboratory studies and early preliminary field evaluations (Orient Gene, Deepblue and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test ), of which one underwent extended clinical assessment in field studies ( Innova ). 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48) and a viral antigen detection/sensitivity (using RNA RT-PCR as a proxy for the presence of antigen) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.4-84.3). Sensitivity was significantly lower when testing was undertaken by non-experts with limited initial training <h4>Interpretation</h4> Several LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission. <h4>Funding</h4> Department of Health and Social Care.

0	Risk factors related to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study in Wuhan, China. <h4>Background: </h4> The COVID-19 pandemic has been considered a great threat to global public health. We aimed to clarify the risk factors associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and progression from ARDS to death and construct a risk prediction model. <h4>Methods: </h4> In this single-centered, retrospective, and observational study, 796 COVID-19 patients developed ARDS and 735 COVID-19 patients without ARDS were matched by propensity score at an approximate ratio of 1:1 based on age, sex and comorbidities. Demographic data, symptoms, radiological findings, laboratory examinations, and clinical outcomes were compared between those with or without ARDS. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore the risk factors for development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death and establish a comprehensive risk model. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Higher SOFA, qSOFA, APACHE II and SIRS scores, elevated inflammatory cytokines, dysregulated multi-organ damage biomarkers, decreased immune cell subsets were associated with higher proportion of death (34.17% vs 1.22%; P <0.001) and increased risk odds of death (OR=57.216, 95%CI=28.373-115.378; P <0.001) in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. In addition to previous reported risk factors related to ARDS development and death, such as neutrophils, IL-6, D-Dimer, leukocytes and platelet, we identified elevated TNF-α (OR=1.146, 95%CI=1.100-1.194; P <0.001), CK-MB (OR=1.350, 95%CI=1.180-1.545; P <0.001), declined ALB (OR=0.834, 95%CI=0.799-0.872; P <0.001), CD8 + T cells (OR=0.983, 95%CI=0.976-0.990; P <0.001) and CD3 - CD19 + B cells (OR=0.992, 95%CI=0.988-0.997; P =0.003) as novel risk factors. Most importantly, the predictive accuracy of the combined model integrating four score systems and these risk factors demonstrated highest among all models for the development of ARDS (AUC= 0.904) and the progression from ARDS to death (AUC= 0.959). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> COVID-19 patients with ARDS were more likely to develop into death. The potential risk factors and the comprehensive prediction model could be helpful to identify patients that are at risk of developing ARDS with poor prognosis at an early stage, which might help physicians to formulate a timely therapeutic strategy.	false
0	Model-based cellular kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: different immune response modes and treatment strategies. Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients’ data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naïve T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.	false
0	Modeling the population effects of epitope specific escape mutations in SARS-CoV-2 to guide vaccination strategies. Escape mutations (EM) to SARS-Cov-2 have been detected and are spreading. Vaccines may need adjustment to respond to these or future mutations. We designed a population level model integrating both waning immunity and EM. We also designed a set of criteria for elaborating and fitting this model to cross-neutralization and other data in a manner that minimizes vaccine decision errors. We formulated four model variations. These define criteria for which prior infections provide immunity that can be escaped. They also specify different sequences where one EM follows another. At all reasonable parameter values, these model variations led to patterns where: 1) EM were rare in the first epidemic, 2) rebound epidemics after the first epidemic were accelerated more by increasing drifting than by increasing waning (with some exceptions), 3) the long term endemic level of infection was determined mostly by waning rates with small effects of the drifting parameter, 4) EM caused loss of vaccine effectiveness and under some conditions, vaccines induced EM that caused higher levels of infection with vaccines than without them. The differences and similarities across the four models suggest paths for developing models specifying the epitopes where EM act. This model is a base on which to construct epitope specific evolutionary models using new high-throughput assay data from population samples to guide vaccine decisions.	false
0	Versatile and multivalent nanobodies efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Cost-effective, efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). We discovered Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at concentrations below the nanograms-per-milliliter level, and we determined a structure of one of the most potent Nbs in complex with the RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and nonoverlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. We bioengineered multivalent Nb constructs that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization and aerosolization.Copyright © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Elicits Cell Signaling in Human Host Cells: Implications for Possible Consequences of COVID-19 Vaccines. The world is suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike protein to enter the host cells. Vaccines that introduce the spike protein into our body to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies are currently being developed. In this article, we note that human host cells sensitively respond to the spike protein to elicit cell signaling. Thus, it is important to be aware that the spike protein produced by the new COVID-19 vaccines may also affect the host cells. We should monitor the long-term consequences of these vaccines carefully, especially when they are administered to otherwise healthy individuals. Further investigations on the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on human cells and appropriate experimental animal models are warranted.	false
0	Parameter Estimation and Prediction of COVID-19 Epidemic Turning Point and Ending Time of a Case Study on SIR/SQAIR Epidemic Models. In this paper, the SIR epidemiological model for the COVID-19 with unknown parameters is considered in the first strategy. Three curves (S, I, and R) are fitted to the real data of South Korea, based on a detailed analysis of the actual data of South Korea, taken from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Using the least square method and minimizing the error between the fitted curve and the actual data, unknown parameters, like the transmission rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate, are estimated. The goodness of fit model is investigated with two criteria (SSE and RMSE), and the uncertainty range of the estimated parameters is also presented. Also, using the obtained determined model, the possible ending time and the turning point of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States are predicted. Due to the lack of treatment and vaccine, in the next strategy, a new group called quarantined people is added to the proposed model. Also, a hidden state, including asymptomatic individuals, which is very common in COVID-19, is considered to make the model more realistic and closer to the real world. Then, the SIR model is developed into the SQAIR model. The delay in the recovery of the infected person is also considered as an unknown parameter. Like the previous steps, the possible ending time and the turning point in the United States are predicted. The model obtained in each strategy for South Korea is compared with the actual data from KDCA to prove the accuracy of the estimation of the parameters.

0	Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study. <h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Background</h4> COVID-19 appears to have caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socio-economics, climate, surveillance, and policy responses. The Philippines is a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak but has recently curtailed transmission while gradually easing interventions. <h4>Methods</h4> We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a “Minimum Health Standards” policy, MHS) to represent the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and projected the impacts of easing interventions. <h4>Results</h4> Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. Several of the fitted epidemiological parameters were consistent with those reported in high-income settings. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 15-32%. The December 2020 case detection rate was estimated at ∼14%, population recovered at ∼12%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. <h4>Conclusions</h4> COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, and mobility, and the epidemic can be understood within a similar framework as for high-income settings. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS measures should allow the Philippines to maintain epidemic control, but disease resurgence remains a threat due to low population immunity and detection rates.	false
0	Deep vein thrombosis in COVID-19 patients in general wards: prevalence and association with clinical and laboratory variables. BACKGROUND: Preliminary reports suggest a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is perceived as a frequent finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data describing the prevalence of DVT are lacking., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to report the prevalence of DVT in COVID-19 patients in general wards, blinded to symptoms/signs of disease, using lower extremities duplex ultrasound (LEDUS) in random patients. We tested the association of DVT with clinical, laboratory and inflammatory markers and also reported on the secondary endpoint of in-hospital mortality., PATIENTS/METHODS: n = 263 COVID-19 patients were screened with LEDUS between March 01, 2020 and April 05, 2020 out of the overall n = 1012 admitted with COVID-19., RESULTS: DVT was detected in n = 67 screened patients (25.5%), n = 41 patients (15.6%) died during the index hospitalization. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that only C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.009, 95% CI 1.004-1.013, p < 0.001) was independently associated with the presence of DVT at LEDUS. Both age (odds ratio 1.101, 95% CI 1.054-1.150, p < 0.001) and C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.012, 95% CI 1.006-1.018, p < 0.001) were instead significantly independently associated with in-hospital mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The main study finding is that DVT prevalence in COVID-19 patients admitted to general wards is 25.5%, suggesting it may be reasonable to screen COVID-19 patients for this potentially severe but treatable complication, and that inflammation, measured with serum C-reactive protein, is the main variable associated with the presence of DVT, where all other clinical or laboratory variables, age or D-dimer included, are instead not independently associated with DVT.	false
0	Data from the first wave of Covid-19 from the Central Military Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic. AIMS: To process data from the first wave of Covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) collected in the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) of the First Faculty of Medicine and Central Military Hospital, Prague. To analyse some clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Covid-19 in the context of the Czech Republic and to compare them with the data from the most recent literature., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data on patients admitted to the IDC between 12 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The study cohort included 53 patients with Covid-19, 25 females and 28 males, with an average age of 57 years. The parameters analysed were clinical symptoms, average length of hospital stay, complications, and death. Additional data concerned the age, weight, smoking habits, history of comorbidities, and selected laboratory results. These data were compared between groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19. Finally, imaging findings, serology results, and therapy outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaStat software., RESULTS: Eleven (20.8%) patients had a mild course of the disease, 16 (30.2%) patients had a moderate course, 22 (41.5%) patients had a severe course, and four (7.5%) patients had a critical course. The study patients presented with the following clinical symptoms: fever in 88.5% of cases, cough in 84.6% of cases, difficulty breathing in 77.4% of cases, diarrhoea in 23.1% of cases, chest pain in 17.3% of cases, and anosmia in 11.5% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was eight days. The most common complication was a bacterial superinfection, reported in 17 (32.1%) study patients. The overall case fatality rate for Covid-19 in our study was 5.7%. The average age of the study cohort was 57 years, and patients with a severe course of the disease were of older average age than those with a less severe course of the disease (p < 0.05). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The analysis of the baseline laboratory data showed significant differences between the groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19 in CRP, procalcitonin, and d-dimers but not in lymphocyte count. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs was performed in 22 patients, and 21 of them had typical findings for Covid-19. The average MuLBSTA score for Covid-19 pneumonia severity in our study cohort was 11.5 points and was not associated with the severity of the course of the disease. Serology tests were performed in 43 study patients, with 29 (67.4%) of them turning out positive in the first test and other five (11.6%) testing positive when retested. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was given experimentally as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin (AZI) to 24 (45.3%) patients. Two patients on HCQ therapy also received inosinum pranobexum (isoprinosine) for severe lymphopenia, one patient received convalescent plasma, six patients were given AZI alone, and one patient was treated with inosinum pranobexum alone. Altogether 37.7% of study patients were prescribed other antibiotics for confirmed or suspected bacterial superinfection. Standard clinical and pharmaceutical care was provided to patients with particular focus on the safety of off-label drug use. HCQ was with drawn in three patients due to a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc)., CONCLUSIONS: In the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our study patients showed comorbidities and risk factors which are consistent with the international literature, but the course of the disease was mostly moderate to severe, with a low proportion of critically ill patients and fatal outcomes. As soon as new information became available, new diagnostic and therapeutic options were introduced into routine practice. Based on our experience, we are well prepared for a possible second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the diagnostics, but the therapeutic options still remain very limited.	false
0	Predictive factors for intensive care unit length of stay in COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma. Background/Case Studies: Convalescent plasma (CP) has emerged in the past months as an alternative treatment for COVID-19. We prospectively analysed the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with CP in order to investigate predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay at a single center in Brazil. Study Design/Methods: Thirty COVID-19 patients laboratory-confirmed by RTPCR with severe pneumonia were recruited at a single center in Brazil. Doses of 300-600ml of CP were administered. Primary outcomes were ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation support.The following variables were analysed: Severity organ failure assessment score(SOFA) at day 0 (day of CP transfusion), patient ABO blood group, concomitant use of any other therapies (hydroxychloroquine, azythromicin, tocilizumab, immunoglobulin), neutralizing antibody titers of the patients prior to transfusion (NAbsP) and total titers of neutralizing antibody from CP units transfused (NAbsCP). NAbsCP considers the total amount of antibodies transfused to account for volume differences. Multivariate logistic regression was performed. Results/Findings: In our case series, SOFA at day 0, ABO group, and both NAbs P and NAbsCP were predictive factors of ICU length of stay. At each point increased in SOFA, ICU length of stay was 38.7% longer (MR: 1.387 CI 95% 1.254-1.534, p<0.001). Group A had36.1% longer ICU length of stay (MR: 0.639 CI 95% 0.417-0.980, p 0.04). Increases of 100 units in NAbsP resulted in 1% reduction of ICU lenght of stay (MR 0.990 CI 95% 0.982-0.998, p 0.017). Similar results were obtained with NAbs-CP, with 2% reduction in ICU length of stay (MR 0.980 CI95% 0.968-0.993, p 0.002) at each 100 unit increase. Use of other therapies did not influence ICU lenght of stay (p 0.373). We perform the same analysis for duration of mechanical ventilation support, and all the variables failed to demonstrate any association Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that severity of disease prior to transfusion, ABO group, patient capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies and transfusion of CP with high titer NAbs are significant predictive factors for ICU length of stay. High titer NAbs CP may add benefit to these patients. No association was found between these same variables and duration of mechanical ventilation.	false
0	The SARS-CoV-2 Cytopathic Effect Is Blocked by Lysosome Alkalizing Small Molecules. Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 virus' pathways of infection, virus-host-protein interactions, and mechanisms of virus-induced cytopathic effects will greatly aid in the discovery and design of new therapeutics to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose-limiting toxicities in patients. Therefore, we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds to identify an alternative lysosome-based drug repurposing opportunity. We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 muM and selectivity indices (SIs; SI = CC50/EC50) ranging from 1.5- to >10-fold. The compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) reduced (ROC-325) viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV-NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest the lysosome as a potential host cell target to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and inhibitors of lysosomal function could become an important component of drug combination therapies aimed at improving treatment and outcomes for COVID-19.

0	Impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in changes of prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents in Bangladesh. Lockdown, isolation, quarantine and social distancing are proved to be only effective measures to prevent and tackle COVID-19 till date. Unfortunately, these measures have caused physical, economical and mental health problems. Children and adolescents are not immune to the adverse mental health effect due to the new changes. Research around the globe shows children and adolescents are suffering from an increased number of depressive symptoms, clinginess, inattention, irritability and worry. This cross-sectional online-based survey type study was aimed to get a snapshot of the prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent population in Bangladesh before and during lockdown. Validated Bangla parent version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to assess the psychopathology among subjects. Total sample was 552 aged from 4-17 years. Boy-girl ratio was 1.3:1. Prevalence of any predictive psychiatric disorder before lockdown was 20.5 % and within lockdown was 39.7 % and the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001). Prevalence of emotional, conduct disorder and hyperactivity were also increased significantly during the lockdown period than before. Conduct disorder and hyperactivity were more prevalent among boys both before and within lockdown. In contrast, prevalence of emotional disorder was higher among girls before lockdown but within the lockdown period, the boy-girl prevalence was almost the same. This study shows the new extreme measures to tackle COVID-19 has a disaster impact on mental health of children and adolescents. Subsequent studies and support should be developed to prevent conditions getting worse. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy amid the COVID-19 state of emergency. OBJECTIVES: Maternity harassment, known in English as pregnancy discrimination, remains prevalent in developed countries. However, research examining the mental health effects of maternity harassment is lacking. We aimed to examine the association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy in Japan., METHODS: A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted on 359 pregnant employees (including women who were working at the time their pregnancy was confirmed) from May 22 to May 31, 2020, during which time a COVID-19 state of emergency was declared. Maternity harassment was defined as being subjected to any of the 16 adverse treatments prohibited by national guidelines. Depression was defined as a score of >=9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Japanese version). Logistic regression analysis was performed., RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% of the pregnant employees had experienced maternity harassment by supervisors and/or colleagues. After adjusting for demographics, pregnancy status, work status, and fear of COVID-19, pregnant employees who experienced maternity harassment were more likely to have depression than those who did not (odds ratio 2.48, 95% confidential interval 1.34-4.60). This association was not influenced by whether they were teleworking or not as a COVID-19 measure., CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of pregnant employees experienced maternity harassment and had a higher prevalence of depression than those who did not. Being physically away from the office through teleworking may not reduce the effect of maternal harassment on depression. To protect the mental health and employment of pregnant women, employers should comply with the laws and take measures to prevent maternity harassment. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

0	Prevalence and correlates of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the major role of stigmatization in low- and middle-income countries: A multinational cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: Currently, there is little data on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the pooled and separate prevalence and determinants of depression during the pandemic in samples from four LMICs., METHODS: Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2., RESULTS: The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression symptoms in the LMICs are similar to those reported in China and in most high-income countries during the pandemic. The findings emphasize the need for implementing non-fear-based education programs during epidemics to reduce stigmatization. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assay Needs for the Next Phase of the US COVID-19 Pandemic Response. Background: There is a need for validated and standardized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quantitative immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralization assays that can be used to understand the immunology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response., Methods: Literature searches were conducted to identify English language publications from peer-reviewed journals and preprints from January 2020 through November 6, 2020. Relevant publications were reviewed for mention of IgG or neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2, or both, and the methods of reporting assay results., Results: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG results have been reported from a limited number of studies; most studies used in-house laboratory-developed tests in limited settings, and only two semiquantitative tests have received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). As of November 6, 2020, there is only one SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay with FDA EUA. Relatively few studies have attempted correlation of quantitative IgG titers with neutralization results to estimate surrogates of protection. The number of individuals tested is small compared with the magnitude of the pandemic, and persons tested are not representative of disproportionately affected populations. Methods of reporting quantitative results are not standardized to enable comparisons and meta-analyses., Conclusions: Lack of standardized SARS-CoV-2 quantitative IgG and neutralization assays precludes comparison of results from published studies. Interassay and interlaboratory validation and standardization of assays will support efforts to better understand antibody kinetics and longevity of humoral immune responses postillness, surrogates of immune protection, and vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Public-private partnerships could facilitate realization of these advances in the United States and worldwide.

0	Mental Health Outcomes in Healthcare Workers in COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Care Units: A Cross-Sectional Survey in Belgium. Background: The literature shows the negative psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on frontline healthcare workers. However, few are known about the mental health of physicians and nurses working in general hospitals during the outbreak, caring for patients with COVID-19 or not., Objectives: This survey assessed differences in mental health in physicians and nurses working in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medical care units., Design: A cross-sectional mixed-mode survey was used to assess burnout, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress., Setting: A total of 1,244 physicians and nurses from five general hospitals in Belgium, working in COVID-19 care units (CCU), non-COVID-19 care units (NCCU), or both (CCU + NCCU) were informed of the study., Participants: Six hundred forty-seven healthcare workers participated in the survey (response rate = 52%)., Measurements: Validated instruments were used to assess the outcomes: the PFI (burnout/professional fulfillment), the ISI (insomnia), and the DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress)., Results: Results showed high prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among participants. After adjusting for confounders, multivariate analysis of variance showed no differences between CCU, NCCU, and CCU + NCCU workers. Univariate general linear models showed higher level of burnout, insomnia, and anxiety among nurses in comparison to physicians. Being a nurse, young, isolated, with an increased workload were risk factors for worse mental health outcomes., Limitations: The mental health of the tested sample, before the outbreak, is unknown. Moreover, this cross-sectional design provides no information on the evolution of the mental health outcomes over time., Conclusion: Directly caring for patients with COVID-19 is not associated with worse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in general hospitals. High prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among physicians and nurses requires special attention, and specific interventions need to be implemented., Protocol Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04344145.

0	Religious Coping, Depression and Anxiety among Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Malaysian Perspective. Anxiety and depression have been prevalent among Healthcare Workers (HCWs) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic and their association with religious coping. A cross-sectional study design was applied. The scales utilized were Malay versions of the Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE M) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS M). In total, 200 HCWs were recruited. HCWs scored higher in positive religious coping (mean: 21.33) than negative religious coping (mean: 10.52). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 36.5% and 29.5%. Both positive and negative religious coping were significantly associated with anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Positive coping predicted reduction in anxiety (adjusted b = -0.15, p = 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = -0.019, p = 0.025). Negative coping predicted increment of anxiety (adjusted b = 0.289, p < 0.001) and log-transformed depression score (adjusted b = 0.052, p < 0.001). Positive religious coping is vital in reducing anxiety and depression among HCWs amid the pandemic. Strategies which increase positive religious coping and reduce negative religious coping must be emphasized to boost mental health among HCWs.	false
0	Challenges, limitations, and solutions for orthodontists during the coronavirus pandemic: A review. INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic patients worldwide missed appointments during the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A significant problem with this virus is its high transmission power. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. The aim of this review is to examine orthodontic emergencies and the necessary strategies and measures for emergency and nonemergency treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. METHOD(S): The following databases were comprehensively searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Up-to-date data released by major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and major orthodontic associations involved in the pandemic were also evaluated. RESULT(S): Few studies were conducted on managing orthodontic offices or clinics during the pandemic, and most are not of high quality. Appropriate communication is the most important issue in managing orthodontic patients, particularly virtual counseling. Many orthodontic emergencies can be managed in this way by patients themselves. Most studies recommend using the filtering facepiece 2 masks, equivalent to N95 masks for non-COVID-19 patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures and all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in orthodontic visits. CONCLUSION(S): At this time, there are no definitive clinical protocols supported by robust evidence for orthodontic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Orthodontists should not rush to return to routine orthodontic work and should follow state guidelines. Nonemergency orthodontic visits should be suspended during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in high-risk areas. Resuming orthodontic procedures during the pandemic requires paying special attention to screening, performing maximum efforts to reduce aerosol generation, using appropriate personal protective equipment, having proper ventilation, and fully adhering to sterilization and disinfection principles.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Orthodontists.

0	Clinical performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic products anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. Background/Case Studies: This study was designed to assess the analytical and clinical performance of the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total assay (VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total) on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ/ 3600 Immunodiagnostic Systems and the VITROS 5600/ XT 7600 Integrated Systems. Study Design/Methods: Antibody detection in VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total assay is achieved using SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein antigen coated onto the well. Sample is added to the coated wells in the first stage of the reaction, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody from the sample is captured. After washing, HRP conjugated SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein antigens are added. Following a final wash, bound HRP conjugates are detected using the VITROS signal reagent. The assay cut-off for VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total is 1.00; values equal to or above the cut-off are Reactive for SARSCoV- 2 antibodies and values below 1.00 are Non-reactive. Clinical testing was performed at the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics R&D lab located in Rochester, NY, USA. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated using 86 samples from 86 individuals diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR, frozen and then sent to the R&D lab for evaluation. Date of reported onset of symptoms were reported for 69 of the 86 samples. Clinical specificity was evaluated using frozen serum and EDTA plasma samples from 400 healthy blood donors collected prior to 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed to calculate the positive percent agreement (PPA) to PCR positivity and the clinical specificity of the assay. A five-day precision study was performed on a 12-member panel including 4 non-reactive, 1 cutoff, 3 weakly reactive and 3 moderately reactive samples using one reagent kit lot and one analyzer. Analytical specificity was assessed by testing patient samples known to include potentially interfering substances and potentially cross-reacting subgroups. Results/Findings: The sensitivity of VITROS SARSCoV- 2 Total was 100.0% (49/49, 95% CI: 92.7-100.0%) for samples collected >8 days after onset of symptoms were reported. Specificity in the blood donor population for VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total was 100% (400/400, 95% CI: 99.1-100.0%). The 5-day precision study demonstrated within calibration precision in samples with results >= 0.50 S/C ranging from 3.1% to 6.1%. Other disease states and potentially interfering substances were shown to not impact test results. Conclusion(s): The VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total assay demonstrates excellent clinical sensitivity and specificity.	false
0	High frequency of cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Background: COVID-19 intensive care patients can present with neurological syndromes, usually in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The recent finding of some virus-neutralizing antibodies cross-reacting with brain tissue suggests the possible involvement of specific autoimmunity. Design(s): Blood and CSF samples from eleven critically ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms including myoclonus, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures, were analyzed for anti-neuronal and anti-glial autoantibodies. Result(s): Using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain sections, all patients showed anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF. Antigens included intracellular and neuronal surface proteins, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also various specific undetermined epitopes, reminiscent of the brain tissue binding observed with certain human monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. Conclusion(s): The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). Several underlying autoantigens and their potential molecular mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 still await identification. However, autoantibodies may already now explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	A method to detect immunoreactions on the basis of current vs. concentration slope - an electrochemical approach. The emergence of novel infectious diseases is rising with time and is a major threat to the society. The recent outbreak of infectious coronavirus disease has made a huge impact in our lives. The massive outbreak of the disease revealed that there is room for development of new diagnostics tools and methods to screen huge numbers of samples in the shortest possible time. Our current work relates to an electronic diagnostic system and method that rapidly detects the presence of an antigen in solution. Our designed system is capable of separating the immunocomplex formation on the basis of the slope it produces in contrast to the controls, when oxidation peak current is plotted against the concentration of the reactant after electrochemistry measurement. In this system, antibody conjugated copper nanoparticles synthesized by the electroexplosion method has played the key role. The values of the slopes of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was found to be -3.7637, whereas those for CuNP conjugated Antibody and CuNPAntibodyAntigen were -2.3044 and -0.8332, respectively. Hence, the current method could become one of the easiest and fastest method for the electronic detection of an immune reaction and a good replacement for the time-consuming, label-based assays in multistep reaction.	false
0	COVID-19 and stroke. Due to the pandemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the stroke medical care system is unavoidably undergoing major changes such as a decrease in the number of stroke patients receiving consultation, delay in consultation, and a decrease in the number of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Stroke incidence in COVID-19 patients is approximately 1.1%. The features of stroke with COVID-19 have been elucidated: higher incidence in ischemic stroke than hemorrhagic stroke, increasing number of young patients, high Ddimer levels, and higher risk in elderly patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. In patients with COVID-19, venous thromboembolism is more common than arterial thromboembolism, and stroke is more common than acute coronary syndrome. Protected code stroke (PCS) has been proposed which provides safe, effective and prompt treatment under complete infection control.Copyright © 2020 Societas Neurologica Japonica.

0	Decreased serum level of sphingosine-1-phosphate: a novel predictor of clinical severity in COVID-19. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a crucial problem in patient treatment and outcome. The aim of this study is to evaluate circulating level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) along with severity markers, in COVID-19 patients. One hundred eleven COVID-19 patients and forty-seven healthy subjects were included. The severity of COVID-19 was found significantly associated with anemia, lymphocytopenia, and significant increase of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, ferritin, fibrinogen, aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer. Serum S1P level was inversely associated with COVID-19 severity, being significantly correlated with CRP, LDH, ferritin, and D-dimer. The decrease in S1P was strongly associated with the number of erythrocytes, the major source of plasma S1P, and both apolipoprotein M and albumin, the major transporters of blood S1P. Not last, S1P was found to be a relevant predictor of admission to an intensive care unit, and patient's outcome. Circulating S1P emerged as negative biomarker of severity/mortality of COVID-19 patients. Restoring abnormal S1P levels to a normal range may have the potential to be a therapeutic target in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"Atypical Divergence of SARS-CoV-2 Orf8 from Orf7a within the Coronavirus Lineage Suggests Potential Stealthy Viral Strategies in Immune Evasion. Orf8, one of the most puzzling genes in the SARS lineage of coronaviruses, marks a unique and striking difference in genome organization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. Here, using sequence comparisons, we unequivocally reveal the distant sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 Orf8 with its SARS-CoV-1 counterparts and the X4-like genes of coronaviruses, including its highly divergent ""paralog"" gene Orf7a, whose product is a potential immune antagonist of known structure. Supervised sequence space walks unravel identity levels that drop below 10% and yet exhibit subtle conservation patterns in this novel superfamily, characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich topology. We document the high accuracy of the sequence space walk process in detail and characterize the subgroups of the superfamily in sequence space by systematic annotation of gene and taxon groups. While SARS-CoV-1 Orf7a and Orf8 genes are most similar to bat virus sequences, their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts are closer to pangolin virus homologs, reflecting the fine structure of conservation patterns within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The divergence between Orf7a and Orf8 is exceptionally idiosyncratic, since Orf7a is more constrained, whereas Orf8 is subject to rampant change, a peculiar feature that may be related to hitherto-unknown viral infection strategies. Despite their common origin, the Orf7a and Orf8 protein families exhibit different modes of evolutionary trajectories within the coronavirus lineage, which might be partly attributable to their complex interactions with the mammalian host cell, reflected by a multitude of functional associations of Orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 compared to a very small number of interactions discovered for Orf7a. IMPORTANCE Orf8 is one of the most puzzling genes in the SARS lineage of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Using sophisticated sequence comparisons, we confirm its origins from Orf7a, another gene in the lineage that appears as more conserved, compared to Orf8. Orf7a is a potential immune antagonist of known structure, while a deletion of Orf8 was shown to decrease the severity of the infection in a cohort study. The subtle sequence similarities imply that Orf8 has the same immunoglobulin-like fold as Orf7a, confirmed by structure determination. We characterize the subgroups of this superfamily and demonstrate the highly idiosyncratic divergence patterns during the evolution of the virus."	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Infection Severity Is Linked to Superior Humoral Immunity against the Spike. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a global pandemic. The antigen specificity of the antibody response mounted against this novel virus is not understood in detail. Here, we report that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a larger antibody response against the spike and nucleocapsid protein and epitope spreading to subdominant viral antigens, such as open reading frame 8 and nonstructural proteins. Subjects with a greater antibody response mounted a larger memory B cell response against the spike, but not the nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, we revealed that antibodies against the spike are still capable of binding the D614G spike mutant and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-1 receptor binding domain. Together, this study reveals that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a greater overall antibody response to the spike and nucleocapsid protein and a larger memory B cell response against the spike. IMPORTANCE With the ongoing pandemic, it is critical to understand how natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 develops. We have identified that subjects with more severe COVID-19 disease mount a more robust and neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Subjects who mounted a larger response against the spike also mounted antibody responses against other viral antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein and ORF8. Additionally, this study reveals that subjects with more severe disease mount a larger memory B cell response against the spike. These data suggest that subjects with more severe COVID-19 disease are likely better protected from reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2021 Guthmiller et al.	false
0	Description of a late miscarriage case at 16 Weeks of Gestation associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: Data about obstetric complications of maternal infection by SARS-CoV-2 remain sparse., CASE: A 40-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 3 para 1 with no previous obstetric complications, presented a late miscarriage at 16 weeks of gestation on day 9 of COVID-19 disease. The results of her nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, tested the same day, were negative, but the placenta was infected by SARS-CoV-2 and serology was positive 11 days later. No other obstetric or infectious cause was found to explain this outcome., CONCLUSION: This case strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a late miscarriage. Copyright © 2021.

0	COVID-19 patients may become predisposed to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that have killed over one million people worldwide so far. To date, over forty million people have officially been identified to be infected with this virus with less than 3% death rate. Since many more people are expected to have been infected with this virus without the official diagnosis, the number of people who have recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be substantial. Given the large number of people recovered from either the mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe COVID-19 conditions, it is critical to understand the long-term consequences of the infection by this virus. Our histological evaluations revealed that patients died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls, one important hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By contrast, such pulmonary vascular remodeling lesions were not found in patients died of SARS-CoV-1 during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak or due to the infection by H1N1 influenza. The advancement in the treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been remarkable that HIV-infected individuals now live for a long time, in turn revealing that these individuals become susceptible to developing PAH, a fatal condition. We herein hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that is capable to triggering the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to developing PAH in the future. Given the large number of people being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic and that most people recover from severe, mild or asymptomatic conditions, it is imperative to generate scientific information on how the health of recovered individuals may be affected long-term. PAH is one lethal consequence that should be considered and needs to be monitored. This may also foster the research on developing therapeutic agents to prevent PAH, which has not so far been successful. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

0	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to COVID-19: An update regarding the presentation of two critically ill patients. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to COVID-19 is defined as the presence of persistent fever, inflammation, and organ dysfunction, with evidence of past or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and excluding other microbial causes. It overlaps with other inflammatory diseases (Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome) and shares some features with hypercytokinemia conditions (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome). It differs from these and severe acute COVID-19 in its clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. It has a potentially severe course and may occur with cardiovascular failure; mortality is low (2 %). Here we provide an update on this syndrome and describe the presentation of two clinical cases with cardiovascular dysfunction who required vasoactive support and invasive ventilation. Serum lab tests showed inflammation parameters. Both patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and systemic corticosteroids and had a favorable course.

0	The role of mesenchymal stem cells in COVID-19 treatment. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a sense of global panic and the medical community started to search for rapid answers. Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technological ways. With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is observed that asymptomatic symptoms turn out to be severe and fatal. By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential effect of MSCs types in COVID-19 infection without definite treatment.	false

0	Diverse Humoral Immune Responses in Younger and Older Adult COVID-19 Patients. We sought to discover links between antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and patient clinical variables, cytokine profiles and antibodies to endemic coronaviruses. Serum from patients of varying ages and clinical severity were collected and used to probe a novel multi-coronavirus protein microarray containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins and overlapping protein fragments of varying length as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 proteins. IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to specific epitopes within the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane proteins (M) were higher in older adult patients. Moreover, the older age group displayed more consistent correlations of antibody reactivity with systemic cytokine and chemokine responses when compared to the younger adult group. A subset of patients, however, had little or no response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and disproportionately severe clinical outcomes. Further characterization of these serosilent individuals with cytokine analysis revealed significant differences in IL-10, IL-15, IP-10, EGF and sCD40L levels when compared to seroreactive patients in the cohort.	false
0	Pneumonia in healthcare workers during a COVID-19 outbreak at a cardiovascular hospitals. Objectives: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been at high risk of infection. This study investigated clinical and treatment characteristics of infected HCWs at a cardiovascular hospital. Method(s): This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary cardiovascular hospital and included HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Subjects completed a questionnaire on health status, symptoms, admission to hospital and treatment. Vaccination status against tuberculosis, hepatitis B and seasonal influenza was assessed. Pneumonia was defined as ground glass opacifications (GGOs) and consolidations on computed tomography (CT). Result(s): This study included 107 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19, representing 15% of all HCWs (n = 726) at the study hospital. Most of the confirmed cases worked in the cardiac surgery department, the anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine department, and the postoperative ward [74/107 (69%)]. A substantial number of infected HCWs were asymptomatic [31 (28.9%)], and 38 (35.5%) were admitted to hospital. The mean +/- standard deviation length of hospital stay was 8.1 +/- 5.6 days. Seventy-five of 107 (70.1%) confirmed cases had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Pneumonia with GGOs and consolidations on CT occurred in 25 of 107 (23.4%) HCWs, with 14 (13.1%) cases of bilateral involvement. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including characteristics known to be associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 (i.e. obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, current smoking, heart failure, seasonal influenza immunization), only seasonal influenza immunization remained an independent predictor of the occurrence of bilateral pneumonia (odds ratio 0.207, 95% confidence interval 0.050-0.847; P = 0.029). Conclusion(s): The association found between seasonal influenza immunization and less-aggressive COVID-19 pneumonia may support the implementation of preventive measures to reduce the global burden of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Disulfiram Ethanol Reaction with Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer: An Exploratory Study. AIMS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence and clinical manifestation of disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER) and isopropanol toxicity (IT) in patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram. Alcohol-based hand rub contains either ethanol or isopropanol or both. COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide scale usage of sanitizers. Patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram, might experience disulfiram ethanol like reactions with alcohol-based sanitizers. METHOD(S): We telephonically contacted 339 patients, prescribed disulfiram between January 2014 and March 2020. The assessment pertained to the last 3 months (i.e. third week of March to third week of June 2020). RESULT(S): The sample consisted of middle-aged men with a mean 16 years of alcohol dependence. Among the 82 (24%) patients adherent to disulfiram, 42 (12.3%) were using alcohol-based hand rubs. Out of these, a total of eight patients (19%; 95% CI 9-33) had features suggestive of DER; four of whom also had features indicative of IT. Five patients (62.5%) had mild and self-limiting symptoms. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by three (37.5%). Severe reactions were observed with exposure to sanitizers in greater amounts, on moist skin or through inhalation. CONCLUSION(S): Patients on disulfiram should be advised to use alternate methods of hand hygiene.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Medical Council on Alcohol and Oxford University Press.

Looking into the literature, there have been various protocols proposed in the past for tracheostomy in COVID 19 patients. In the present case series, we have presented our experience of surgical tracheostomy in COVID 19 patients. It is a retrospective case series consisting of 12 COVID 19 patients who underwent tracheostomy from April 2020 to October 2020. We have discussed the tracheostomy in COVID 19 patients with references to their respective indication, location, the procedure, postoperative care and clinical outcomes. Of 12 patients, 6 were operated in the COVID ICU and 6 were operated in the COVID OT. The average duration of the intubation was 4 days (range 3-7 days). The average period of weaning was found to be 65 h (range 48 h 80 h). Of 4 patients associated with comorbidities, two had died 48 h after the surgery. The Primary indication of the tracheostomy can be made flexible based on the infrastructure of the hospital to accommodate increased patient load in a developing country like India. The location and surgical approach does not significantly affect the clinical outcomes of tracheostomy, and it can be safely performed in ICU/OT with adequate ventilation. Irrespective of the COVID status of the patients, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) can ensure adequate protection to the health care personals preventing the spread of infection.

0	The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An Agent-Based Simulation. BACKGROUND: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to significantly reduce transmission and morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths., METHODS: An agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution., RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Simulation results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic activities can be resumed.	false
0	Biological agents for rheumatic diseases in the outbreak of COVID-19: friend or foe?. BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has raised concerns in the rheumatology community about the management of immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. It is not clear whether the use of biological agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID-19 occur as a result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID-19 disease and more recently JAK1/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARS-CoV-2., OBJECTIVES: To estimate COVID-19 infection rate in patients treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RMD), determine the influence of biological agents treatment as risk or protective factors and study the prognosis of patients with rheumatic diseases receiving biological agents compared to the general population in a third-level hospital setting in Leon, Spain., METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at our rheumatology department who received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and December 1st 2020, and analysed COVID-19 infection rate. All patients who attended our rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biological agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biological agent, duration of treatment, mean dose of glucocorticoids and need for intensive care unit . We performed an univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess risk factors of COVID-19 infection., RESULTS: There were a total of 4464 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. 40 patients out of a total of 820 patients with rheumatic diseases (4.8%) receiving bDMARDs contracted COVID-19 and 4 required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 3.6%, and it was 0.89% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. 90% of patients receiving bDMARDS with COVID-19 did not require hospitalisation. Out of the 4464 patients, 869 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biological agents. Patients with rheumatic diseases who tested positive for COVID-19 were older (female: median age 60.8 IQR 46-74; male: median age 61.9 IQR 52-70.3) than those who were negative for COVID-19 (female: median age 58.3 IQR 48-69; male: median age 56.2 IQR 47-66), more likely to have hypertension (45% vs 26%, OR 2.25 (CI 1.18-4.27),p 0.02), cardiovascular disease (23 % vs 9.6%, OR 2.73 (1.25-5.95), p 0.02), be smokers (13% vs 4.6%, OR 2.95 (CI 1.09-7.98), p 0.04), receiving treatment with rituximab (20% vs 8%, 2.28 (CI 1.24-6.32), p 0.02) and a higher dose of glucocorticoids (OR 2.5 (1.3-10.33, p 0.02) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL-6 inhibitors (2.5% vs 14%, OR 0.16, (CI 0.10-0.97, p 0.03). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bDMARD proportions. IL-1 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab-treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID-19 among adult patients with rheumatic diseases. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and patients who tested negative., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID-19. Patients with rheumatic disease diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to be receiving a higher dose of glucocorticoids and treatment with rituximab. IL-6 inhibitors may have a protective effect.

0	Incidence, characteristics and clinical relevance of acute stroke in old patients hospitalized with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Stroke in the course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been shown to be associated with more severe respiratory symptoms and higher mortality, but little knowledge in this regard exists on older populations. We aimed to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and prognosis of acute stroke in geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors., RESULTS: Combined ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 4.15%. 72.7% of events occurred during acute care. Strokes presented with altered state of consciousness and/or delirium in 81.8%, followed by a focal neurological deficit in 45.5%. Ischemic stroke was more frequently unilateral (88.8%) and localized in the middle cerebral artery territory (55.5%). Smoking and a history of previous stroke increased by more than seven (OR 7.44; 95% CI 1.75-31.64; p = 0.007) and five times (OR 5.19; 95% CI 1.50-17.92; p = 0.009), respectively, the risk of stroke. Each additional point in body mass index (BMI) reduced the risk of stroke by 14% (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.98; p = 0.03). In-hospital mortality (32.1% vs. 27.3%; p > 0.999) and institutionalization at discharge (36.4% vs. 21.1%; p = 0.258) were similar between patients with and without stroke., CONCLUSION: Incident stroke complicating COVID-19 in old patients was associated with active smoking, previous history of stroke, and low BMI. Acute stroke did not influence early mortality or institutionalization rate at discharge.	false
0	Competing-risk analysis of coronavirus disease 2019 in-hospital mortality in a Northern Italian centre from SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE). An accurate prediction of the clinical outcomes of European patients requiring hospitalisation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lacking. The aim of the study is to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality and discharge in a cohort of Lombardy patients with COVID-19. All consecutive hospitalised patients from February 21st to March 30th, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 from the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Lombardy, Italy, were included. In-hospital mortality and discharge were evaluated by competing risk analysis. The Fine and Gray model was fitted in order to estimate the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for in-hospital mortality and discharge. 426 adult patients [median age 68 (IQR 56 to 77 years)] were admitted with confirmed COVID-19 over a 5-week period; 292 (69%) were male. By 21 April 2020, 141 (33%) of these patients had died, 239 (56%) patients had been discharged and 46 (11%) were still hospitalised. Among these 46 patients, updated as of 30 May, 2020, 5 (10.9%) had died, 8 (17.4%) were still in ICU, 12 (26.1%) were transferred to lower intensity care units and 21 (45.7%) were discharged. Regression on the CIFs for in-hospital mortality showed that older age, male sex, number of comorbidities and hospital admission after March 4th were independent risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Older age, male sex and number of comorbidities definitively predicted in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.	false
0	COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis patients: susceptibility, severity risk factors and serological response. Background and purpose: Information regarding multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scarce. The study objective was to describe the incidence and characteristics of MS patients with COVID-19, to identify susceptibility and severity risk factors and to assess the proportion of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologies according to disease-modifying treatments. Method(s): This was a retrospective study of an MS cohort analysing data collected between February and May 2020. Cases were identified through an email survey and clinical visits. The relationship of demographic and MS characteristics with COVID-19 and of the disease-modifying treatments with SARS-CoV-2 serostatus were examined. Result(s): Data from 48 suspected cases out of 758 valid respondents and from 45 COVID-19 cases identified through clinical visits were collected. Incidence was 6.3%. Nineteen (20.3%) patients were hospitalized and two (2.2%) died. Multivariable models determined that age (odds ratio [OR] per 10 years 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.85), contact with a confirmed case (OR 197.02, 95% CI 56.36-688.79), residence in Barcelona (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.03-4.80), MS duration (OR per 5 years 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83) and time on anti-CD20 treatment (OR per 2 years 3.48, 95% CI 1.44-8.45) were independent factors for presenting COVID-19 and age (OR per 10 years 2.71, 95% CI 1.13-6.53) for a severe COVID-19. Out of the 79 (84.9%) with serological test, 45.6% generated antibodies, but only 17.6% of those on anti-CD20 therapies. Lymphopaenia or immunoglobulin levels did not relate to COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Multiple sclerosis patients present similar incidence, risk factors and outcomes for COVID-19 as the general population. Patients treated with an anti-CD20 therapy for a longer period of time might be at a higher risk of COVID-19 and less than 20% generate an antibody response. Only age was related to severity.Copyright © 2020 European Academy of Neurology	false
0	Implementing Strategies at the Workplace Level to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake in Public Workers in Argentina: A Controlled Interrupted Time Series Study. <h4>Background: </h4> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common neoplasm and the fourth cause of cancer death worldwide. In Argentina, more than 16,000 cases are diagnosed and 8,700 people die each year. The Immunochemical Faecal Occult Blood Test (iFOBT) is recommended for the prevention and early detection of CRC in people of both sexes, between 50 and 75 years old with average-risk. The worksite setting has great potential to improve adherence to preventive interventions. We aimed to design and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a strategy implemented in the workplace to improve the rate of adherence to the IFOBT screening in employees of the government’s Revenue Agency of the Province of Buenos Aires (ARBA). MethodsWe used a quasi-experimental research design, a controlled interrupted time-series (ITS). The study period was divided into two-time segments: (1) a 51- month pre-intervention period (July 2015 through September 2018); (2) a 5-month post-intervention period (October 2018 through February 2019). We performed an initial formative research using qualitative research methods (semi-structured interviews, focus groups) in order to inform the design of the intervention and adapt it, to ensure that it is both feasible and implementable by the target population. We fitted segmented linear regression models to evaluate changes in the monthly rates per 10,000 of tests done in ARBA employees, and controlling for the proportion of tests done in non-ARBA workers. ResultsA total of 1552 ARBA employees aged 50 or more participated. Overall, iFOBT mean uptake rates were 16 times higher in the intervened during the five-month intervention period, remaining statistically significant after adjusting by the proportion of tests done in the control group (p <0.001). This observed effect was higher in women aged 50 to 59 years. Activities were suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown in the country in 2020.ConclusionsA multifaceted workplace-based intervention helped increase the uptake of CRC screening in public sector employees of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Achieving high implementation rates requires building a healthy relationship with the partner organization, adding their values and views, and establishing agreed upon mechanisms and realistic timelines.	false
0	Prevalence of COVID-19-related risk factors and risk of severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors: A matched cohort study using linked English electronic health records data. Background: People with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses., Methods: We included survivors (>=1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from English primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities., Findings: 108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more diabetes, asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, neurological, renal, and liver diseases, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR >5 years 2.22, 1.31-3.74)., Interpretation: Risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.

0	Intranasal Infection of Ferrets with SARS-CoV-2 as a Model for Asymptomatic Human Infection. Ferrets were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus 2) to assess infection dynamics and host response. During the resulting subclinical infection, viral RNA was monitored between 2 and 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), and reached a peak in the upper respiratory cavity between 4 and 6 dpi. Viral genomic sequence analysis in samples from three animals identified the Y453F nucleotide substitution relative to the inoculum. Viral RNA was also detected in environmental samples, specifically in swabs of ferret fur. Microscopy analysis revealed viral protein and RNA in upper respiratory tract tissues, notably in cells of the respiratory and olfactory mucosae of the nasal turbinates, including olfactory neuronal cells. Antibody responses to the spike and nucleoprotein were detected from 21 dpi, but virus-neutralizing activity was low. A second intranasal inoculation (re-exposure) of two ferrets after a 17-day interval did not produce re-initiation of viral RNA shedding, but did amplify the humoral response in one animal. Therefore, ferrets can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 to model human asymptomatic infection.	false
0	Takotsubo Syndrome and COVID-19: Associations and Implications. Incidence of cardiovascular complications has increased during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, both population-wide and in patients diagnosed with the disease. This increase has presented complications in patient care, leading to increased hospitalizations, adverse outcomes, and medical costs. A condition of interest is takotsubo syndrome, which may be associated with the novel coronavirus. To understand this connection, a narrative review was performed by analyzing primary studies and case reports available. The findings showed increased incidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in both the general population and COVID-19 patients. Proposed mechanisms for the linkage include generalized increases in psychological distress, the cytokine storm, increased sympathetic responses in COVID-19 patients, and microvascular dysfunction. Moreover, natural disasters are noted as likely being associated with increases of takotsubo syndrome. As the pandemic continues, treating COVID-19 as a systemic condition is imperative, with the increase in takotsubo syndrome marking a significant impact of the novel coronavirus.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Causal therapy of COVID-19: Critical review and prospects. The COVID-19 outbreak started in December 2019 in China has spread over all countries of the world within few month acquiring a pandemic nature, the incident population counting millions. The pathogenic mechanisms of the new coronaviral infection caused by never-before-seen virus SARS-CoV2 are yet to be studied. Various drugs are used for COVID-19 treatment and guidelines are continuously revised as new experience is acquired. In the current pandemic situation, it is important to provide specialists with latest information con-cerning efficacy and safety drugs for COVID-19 patients and promising research in this field. The purpose of the review is to critically analyze published data on outcomes of COVID-19 treatment with various drugs including potentially promising drugs. The search has been carried out through such databases as PubMed, Scopus, Cyberleninka, https://www.globalclinicaltrialsdata.com, https://clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library; mostly, randomized clinical trials-2020 and papers dedicated to candidate drugs have been considered. The paper is structured based on the drug's action mechanism and contains parts dedicated to antiviral, immunomodulatory, and an-tibacterial therapies. Looking for a new promising target in COVID-19 treatment, the authors focus their at-tention on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which abundance results in the destruction of extracellular ma-trix, epithelial and endothelial basal membranes and leads to secondary lung tissue injury. The paper provides a theoretic justification of MMP inhibitor use by an example of doxycycline and offers an efficacy study protocol for the new approach to COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion(s): as of now, there are no drugs which efficacy for COVID 19 has been proven. Drugs possessing multiple mechanisms of action are employed beside their specified indications, often in combinations; in this situation, additive side effects with adverse consequences for the patient can hardly be avoided. Administration of drugs with unproven efficacy may be justified only in clinical trials followed by subsequent analysis and publication of findings demonstrating that in case of success, recommendations for a majority of COVID-19 patients could be confidently issued.Copyright © 2020, V.A.

0	The experience of contact tracing in Singapore in the control of COVID-19: highlighting the use of digital technology. Purpose: Containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would require aggressive contact tracing and isolation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. Method(s): An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. Result(s): Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. Conclusion(s): Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.	false
0	Severe COVID-19 Lung Infection in Older People and Periodontitis. Periodontal bacteria dissemination into the lower respiratory tract may create favorable conditions for severe COVID-19 lung infection. Once lung tissues are colonized, cells that survive persistent bacterial infection can undergo permanent damage and accelerated cellular senescence. Consequently, several morphological and functional features of senescent lung cells facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication. The higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, and death in older patients has generated the question whether basic aging mechanisms could be implicated in such susceptibility. Mounting evidence indicates that cellular senescence, a manifestation of aging at the cellular level, contributes to the development of age-related lung pathologies and facilitates respiratory infections. Apparently, a relationship between life-threatening COVID-19 lung infection and pre-existing periodontal disease seems improbable. However, periodontal pathogens can be inoculated during endotracheal intubation and/or aspirated into the lower respiratory tract. This review focuses on how the dissemination of periodontal bacteria into the lungs could aggravate age-related senescent cell accumulation and facilitate more efficient SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment and replication. We also consider how periodontal bacteria-induced premature senescence could influence the course of COVID-19 lung infection. Finally, we highlight the role of saliva as a reservoir for both pathogenic bacteria and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the identification of active severe periodontitis can be an opportune and valid clinical parameter for risk stratification of old patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Role of vitamin D in regulating COVID-19 severity-An immunological perspective. Vitamin D, a key nutrient/prohormone classically associated with skeletal health, is also an important immunomodulator, with pleotropic effects on innate and adaptive immune cells. Outcomes of several chronic, autoimmune, and infectious diseases are linked to vitamin D. Emergent correlations of vitamin D insufficiency with coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, alongside empirical and clinical evidence of immunoregulation by vitamin D in other pulmonary diseases, have prompted proposals of vitamin D supplementation to curb the COVID-19 public health toll. In this review paper, we engage an immunological lens to discuss potential mechanisms by which vitamin D signals might regulate respiratory disease severity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections, vis a vis other pulmonary infections. It is proposed that vitamin D signals temper lung inflammatory cascades during SARS-CoV2 infection, and insufficiency of vitamin D causes increased inflammatory cytokine storm, thus leading to exacerbated respiratory disease. Additionally, analogous to studies of reduced cancer incidence, the dosage of vitamin D compounds administered to patients near the upper limit of safety may serve to maximize immune health benefits and mitigate inflammation and disease severity in SARS-CoV2 infections. We further deliberate on the importance of statistically powered clinical correlative and interventional studies, and the need for in-depth basic research into vitamin D-dependent host determinants of respiratory disease severity.

0	SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: clinical manifestations and the role of infliximab treatment. This study was conducted to assess the clinical spectrum, management, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We reviewed medical records of children with MIS-C diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit between April and June 2020. Thirty-three children were identified including 22 who required critical care (group 1) and 11 with less intense inflammation (group 2). Children in group 1 were older (median 7.0 years) than those in group 2 (median 2.0 years). Abdominal pain was present in 68% of patients in group 1. Hypotension or shock was present in 17/22 patients in group 1. Thirteen (39.4%) had Kawasaki disease (KD)-like manifestations. Five developed coronary artery dilatation; All resolved on follow-up. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given to all patients in group 1 and 7/11 in group 2. Second-line therapy was needed in 13/22 (group 1) for persisting inflammation or myocardial dysfunction; 12 received infliximab. All patients recovered. Conclusion: MIS-C clinical manifestations may overlap with KD; however, MIS-C is likely a distinct inflammatory process characterized by reversible myocardial dysfunction and rarely coronary artery dilatation. Supportive care, IVIG, and second-line therapy with infliximab were associated with a favorable outcome. What is Known: * Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and occasional features of Kawasaki disease (KD). * Treatment includes immunomodulatory agents, most commonly IVIG and corticosteroids.

OBJECTIVE: The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic (COVID-19) presents significant challenges to midwives and nurses. This study aimed to explore midwifery and nursing interventions to limit the transmission of COVID-19 among women in their third trimester of pregnancy, to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection and promote safety of care for women and their infants. METHOD(S): We completed a retrospective review of medical records from 35 women in their third trimester of pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2, admitted to one hospital in Wuhan, China in January and February 2020. We investigated the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, and the individualized midwifery and nursing care offered, including environmental protection, prevention of nosocomial infection, maternal observations, monitoring of signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and psychological care. RESULT(S): Thirty-one women had a caesarean section, and four had vaginal births. Retrospective analysis of midwifery and nursing strategies implemented to care for these women showed no maternal complications or nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The care strategies we implemented could prevent complications and nosocomial infection in the third trimester of pregnancy, thus ensuring the safety of women and their infants. Further research needs to determine treatment priorities for women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy and the postnatal period.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease usually treated with immunomodulatory/ immunosuppressive agents. The use of these agents has been associated with an increased susceptibility to infections. Vaccination might represent a critical aspect in the management of patients with psoriasis treated with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapies. This narrative review aimed to provide an overview on the immune response to vaccines in subjects treated with systemic agents used to treat patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Publications appearing in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI-Web of Knowledge database were selected using Medical Subject Headings key terms. Overall, published data confirmed that vaccination with attenuated live vaccines during therapy with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapies should be avoided. For nonlive vaccines, a more favorable safety profile of biologic agents compared to conventional systemic agents is described as the humoral response to vaccines is in general well-preserved. Treatment with cyclosporine and methotrexate is associated with lower antibody titers to vaccines, and thus these agents are better discontinued during vaccination. In contrast, treatment with biological agents is not associated with lower antibody response and can thus be continued safely.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19 pandemic will continue to pose a major public health threat until vaccination-mediated herd immunity is achieved. Most projections predict vaccines will reach a large subset of the population late in 2021 or early 2022. In the meantime, countries are exploring options to remove strict lockdown measures and allow society and the economy to return to normal function. One possibility is to expand on existing COVID-19 testing strategies by including large-scale rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs). Currently, there is significant variability in performance and features of available POCTs, making selection and procurement of an appropriate test for specific use case difficult. In this review, we have used the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently published target product profiles (TPPs) for specific use cases of COVID-19 diagnostic tests to screen for top-performing POCTs on the market. Several POCTs, based on clinical sensitivity/specificity, the limit of detection, and time to results, which meet WHO TPP criteria for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 (acute infection) or indirect diagnosis of past infection (host antibodies), are highlighted here.	false
0	Application of CAR-T Cell Therapy beyond Oncology: Autoimmune Diseases and Viral Infections. Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) has long been at the forefront of the battle with cancer that began last century with the therapeutic application of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against melanoma. The development of novel ACT approaches led researchers and clinicians to highly efficient technologies based on genetically engineered T lymphocytes, with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells as the most prominent example. CARs consist of an extracellular domain that represents the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) responsible for target recognition and the intracellular domain, which was built from up to several signaling motifs that mediated T cell activation. The number of potential targets amenable for CAR-T cell therapy is expanding rapidly, which means that the tremendous success of this approach in oncology could be further translated to treating other diseases. In this review, we outlined modern trends and recent developments in CAR-T cell therapy from an unusual point of view by focusing on diseases beyond cancer, such as autoimmune disorders and viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.	false

0	Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome. Incidence and risk factors: a Mediterranean cohort study. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyze the incidence of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and its components, and to evaluate the acute infection phase associated risk factors., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of adult patients who had recovered from COVID-19 (27th February to 29th April 2020) confirmed by PCR or subsequent seroconversion, with a systematic assessment 10-14 weeks after disease onset. PCS was defined as the persistence of at least one clinically relevant symptom, or abnormalities in spirometry or chest radiology. Outcome predictors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI)., RESULTS: Two hundred seventy seven patients recovered from mild (34.3%) or severe (65.7%) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated 77 days (IQR 72-85) after disease onset. PCS was detected in 141 patients (50.9%; 95%CI 45.0-56.7%). Symptoms were mostly mild. Alterations in spirometry were noted in 25/269 (9.3%), while in radiographs in 51/277 (18.9%). No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of PCS development., CONCLUSIONS: A Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was detected in a half of COVID19 survivors. Radiological and spirometric changes were mild and observed in less than 25% of patients. No baseline clinical features behaved as independent predictors of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome development.

0	The Effect of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Number and Characteristics of Orthopedic Trauma Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Istanbul. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of the causes of traumatic fractures, types of fractures, and fractures requiring surgery occurred during the one month period following the measures taken by the government due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these data with that of the previous year. Patients and methods The number of patients with fractures, the distribution of these fractures and the number of patients who had surgical indications and underwent a surgery were identified. Patients' age, gender and the type of trauma they were exposed to were determined. Results While there were 117 patients who were diagnosed with a fracture during the one month period in 2020, 619 patients had presented to our department during the same period in 2019. When compared to 2019, the prevalence of the trauma mechanisms for falling from height, traffic accident, low-energy trauma, firearm injury and sports injuries decreased by 91.7%, 85.7%, 80.3%, 80.0% and 72.7%, respectively, in 2020. A statistically significant increase was proportionally observed in pediatric supracondylar humerus, boxer's and hip fractures (p<0.001). Conclusion Compared to the same period last year, although the number of patients with fractures decreased significantly following the implementation of most of the public quarantine measures, a statistically significant increase was observed in pediatric supracondylar humerus, boxer and hip fractures on a proportional basis.

OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the impact of COVID-19 on the life experiences of essential workers attending a COVID-19 antibody testing clinic at a dental school. 2) To compare responses of dental, non-dental health care, and non-health care essential workers. 3) To assess acceptability/satisfaction of testing done in a dental setting. METHOD(S): A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULT(S): Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were ""definitely"" satisfied, and would ""definitely"" recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSION(S): These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study highlight the impact that pandemics such as COVID-19 can have on life experiences of essential workers, including dentists. It also highlights a role that dentistry can play within the broader health care system, during and beyond the current pandemic, to help with surveillance efforts of community health. Testing may also help alleviate stress and anxiety associated with these pandemics."	false

We conducted an initial search in PubMed using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms ""meningitis,"" and ""encephalitis,"", and ""COVID-19"" to affirm the need for a review on the topic of the relationship between meningitis/encephalitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included case series, case reports and review articles of COVID-19 patients with these neurological symptoms. Through PubMed database we identified 110 records. After removal of duplicates, we screened 70 record, and 43 were excluded because they focused on different SARS-CoV-2 neurological complications. For eligibility, we assessed 27 full-text articles which met inclusion criteria. Seven articles were excluded, and twenty studies were included in the narrative review, in which encephalitis and/or meningitis case reports/case series were reported. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially meningoencephalitis; the hypoxic/metabolic changes produced by the inflammatory response against the virus cytokine storm can lead to encephalopathy, and the presence of comorbidities and other neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, predispose to these metabolic changes. Further study are needed to investigate the biological mechanisms of neurological complications of COVID-19."	false
0	Looking to the empirical literature on the potential for financial incentives to enhance adherence with COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination efforts are underway offering hope for saving lives and eliminating the pandemic. The most promising vaccines require two injections separated 3-4 weeks apart. To achieve heard immunity, 70-90% of the population or perhaps more must be inoculated. Anticipation of adherence challenges has generated commentaries on strategies to enhance adherence including financial incentives. A notable gap in these commentaries is any discussion of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of financial incentives for increasing vaccine adherence. This commentary addresses that gap. There is a body of controlled trials on incentivizing vaccine adherence, mostly to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine among injection drug users (IDUs). Prevalence of HBV infection is increasing as part of the opioid addiction crisis. The HBV vaccine entails a three-dose regimen (typically 0, 1, and 6 months) which has created adherence challenges among IDUs. Systematic literature reviews document significant benefit of financial incentives. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis (Tressler & Bhandari, 2019) examined 11 controlled trials examining HBV-vaccine adherence strategies, including financial incentives, accelerated dosing schedules, and case-management/enhanced services. Financial incentives were most effective resulting in a 7-fold increase in adherence to the vaccination regimen relative to no financial incentives (OR, 7.01; 95% CI, 2.88-17.06). Additional reviews provide further support for the efficacy of financial incentives for promoting adherence with vaccination (HBV & influenza). Overall, this literature suggests that financial incentives could be helpful in promoting the high levels of adherence to COVID-19 vaccines that experts project will be necessary for herd immunity.Copyright © 2021	false

0	Opportunities to improve COVID-19 provider communication resources: A systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Communication related to COVID-19 between provider and the patient/family is impacted by isolation requirements, time limitations, and lack of family/partner access. Our goal was to determine the content of provider communication resources and peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 communication in order to identify opportunities for developing future COVID-19 communication curricula and support tools., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the UpToDate clinical decision support resource database, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The grey literature review was conducted in September 2020 and articles published between January-September 2020 written in English were included., RESULTS: A total of 89 sources were included in the review, (n = 36 provider communication resources, n = 53 peer-reviewed articles). Resources were available for all providers, mainly physicians, and consisted of general approaches to COVID-19 communication with care planning as the most common topic. Only four resources met best practices for patient-centered communication. All but three articles described physician communication where a general emphasis on patient communication was the most prevalent topic. Reduced communication channels, absence of family, time, burnout, telemedicine, and reduced patient-centered care were identified as communication barriers. Communication facilitators were team communication, time, patient-centered and family communication, and available training resources., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, resources lack content that address non-physician providers, communication with family, and strategies for telehealth communication to promote family engagement. The gaps identified in this review reveal a need to develop more materials on the following topics: provider moral distress, prevention communication, empathy and compassion, and grief and bereavement. An evidence-base and theoretical grounding in communication theory is also needed., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future development of COVID-19 communication resources for providers should address members of the interdisciplinary team, communication with family, engagement strategies for culturally-sensitive telehealth interactions, and support for provider moral distress.

0	Deep Venous Thrombosis in COVID-19 Patients: A Cohort Analysis. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a severe complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence, risk factors, anticoagulant therapy and sex differences of DVT in patients with COVID-19. The enrolled 121 hospitalized non-ventilator patients were confirmed positive for COVID-19. All suspected patients received color Doppler ultrasound (US) to screen for DVT in both lower extremities. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors related to DVT in COVID-19 patients. DVT was found in 48% of the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with an increased PADUA or Caprini index using US scanning. The multivariate logistic regression determined that age (OR, 1.05; p = .0306), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR, 1.02; p = .0040), and baseline D-dimer (OR, 1.42; p = .0010) were risk factors among COVID-19 patients. Although the most common DVT location was infrapopliteal (classes I and II), higher mortality in DVT-COVID-19 patients was confirmed. DVT-COVID-19 patients presented significant increases in CRP, neutrophil count, and D-dimer throughout the whole inpatient period compared to non-DVT-COVID-19 patients. Although anticoagulation therapy accelerated the recovery of lymphocytopenia in DVT patients, men DVT-COVID-19 patients with anticoagulant therapy showed significant higher CRP and neutrophil count vs. lymphocyte count (N/L) ratio, but showed lower lymphocyte counts compared to women DVT-COVID-19 patients. DVT is common in COVID-19 patients with high-risk factors, especially for older age and higher CRP and baseline D-dimer populations. It is important to consider sex differences in anticoagulant therapy among DVT-COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Efficacy and Safety of Levamisole Treatment in Clinical Presentations of Patients With COVID-19: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial. <h4>Background: </h4> In late December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a series of pneumonia cases in China. Levamisole can show clinical benefits in management of COVID-19 by its immunomodulatory effect, but effect in clinical status of patients is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of levamisole on clinical status of patients with COVID-19 on days 3, 7, and 14.MethodsThis prospective, double-blind, randomized, and controlled clinical trial was performed in 18- to 60-year-old patients with confirmed COVID-19 from late April 2020 to mid-August 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups to receive a 5-day course of levamisole or placebo in combination with routine care. Results50 patients with COVID-19 were analyzed: 25 patients were in each group. More than half of the infected patients was men too (60%). On days 3 and 14, patients in Levamisole group had significantly better cough status distribution compared with Placebo (P=0.034 and 0.005, respectively). The difference in fever status on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 between two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). There was significant differences between two groups in dyspnea over a median follow-up of 7th (P=0.015) and 14th (P=0.010) days after receiving the interventions. ConclusionThe results of the current study have overall demonstrated that patients receiving levamisole had significantly higher odds of having a better clinical status including cough and Dyspnea on day 14 than those receiving placebo, but with an effect-size of unsure clinical importance. The difference in the distribution of fever on days 3, 7, and 14 between two groups was not significant, suggesting that levamisole can efficiently improve the most clinical status of patients with COVID-19 infectious compared to placebo.Trial registration﻿The trial was registered as IRCT20190810044500N7 (19/09/2020).	false
0	Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations in acutely ill patients. Dysregulated immune profiles have been described in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Whether the reported immune alterations are specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection or also triggered by other acute illnesses remains unclear. We performed flow cytometry analysis on fresh peripheral blood from a consecutive cohort of i) patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; ii) patients of comparable age/sex hospitalized for other acute disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative); and iii) healthy controls. Using both data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses, we found several dysregulations in immune cell subsets (e.g. decreased proportion of T cells) that are similarly associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-COVID-19 related acute illnesses. In contrast, we identified specific differences in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g. elevated proportion of ICAM-1 + mature/activated neutrophils, ALCAM + monocytes, and CD38 + CD8 + T cells). A subset of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune alterations correlated with disease severity, disease outcome at 30 days and mortality. Our data provides novel understanding of the immune dysregulation that are specifically associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among acute care hospitalized patients. Our study lays the foundation for the development of specific biomarkers to stratify SARS-CoV-2 + patients at risk of unfavorable outcome and uncover novel candidate molecules to investigate from a therapeutic perspective.	false
0	The ancient cardioprotective mechanisms of ACE2 bestow SARS-CoV-2 with a wide host range. SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated, suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> A conserved mechanism essential for ACE2 catalytic activity is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 binding, allowing the virus to infect a wide range of species.	false
0	Higher expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of Type I IFN signaling. <h4>Background: </h4> Chemokine levels in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been shown to be markedly elevated. But the role of chemokines in mild COVID-19 has not yet been established. According to the epidemiological statistics, most of the COVID-19 cases in Shiyan City, China, have been mild. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of chemokines in mild COVID-19 patients and explore the correlation between chemokines and host immune response. <h4>Methods: </h4> In this study, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect serum levels of chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Shiyan City. Expression of chemokine receptors and of other signaling molecules was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <h4>Result: </h4> s: We first demonstrated that COVID-19 patients, both sever and mild cases, are characterized by higher level of chemokines. Specifically, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is expressed at higher levels both in severe and mild cases of COVID-19. The receptor of MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), was expressed at higher levels in mild COVID-19 patients. Finally, we observed a significant negative correlation between expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and serum levels of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Higher expression of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of IFN signaling. The finding adds to our understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and provides potential therapeutic targets and strategies.	false
0	Efficacy of propolis as an adjunct treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in both propolis groups compared to the controls; median 7 days with 400mg/day and 6 days with 800mg/day, versus 12 days for standard care alone. Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. With the higher dose, significantly fewer patients developed acute kidney injury than in the controls (2 versus 10 of 42 patients). Propolis as an adjunct treatment was safe and reduced hospitalization time. The registration number for this clinical trial is: NCT04480593 (20/07/2020).	false
0	Spatial distribution characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with environmental factors. Investigating the spatial distribution characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and exploring the influence of environmental factors that drive it is the basis for formulating rational and efficient prevention and control countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with the environmental factors. Based on the incidences of new local COVID-19 cases in Beijing from June 11 to July 5, the spatial clustering characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing was investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The relation between COVID-19 cases and environmental factors was assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explore the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the development of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing from June 11 to July 5 could be divided into two stages. The first stage was the outward expansion from June 11 to June 21, and the second stage (from June 22 to July 5) was the growth of the transmission in areas with existing previous cases. In addition, there was a ring of low value clusters around the Xinfadi market. This area was the key area for prevention and control. Population density and distance to Xinfadi market were the most critical factors that explained the pandemic development. The findings of this study can provide useful information for the global fighting against COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Acute pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia: multicentric experience from Italian endemic area. PURPOSE: To analyze pulmonary embolism (PE) on chest computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in hospitalized patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, according to the severity of lung disease based both on temporal CT features changes and on CT-severity lung involvement (CT-severity score), along with the support of clinical and laboratory findings., METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 170 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent CTPA examination for PE suspicion. Pulmonary arteries diameters, right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio, presence, absence, and distribution of PE, pulmonary artery obstructive index (PAO index), and lobe involvement were recorded. All CT scans were reviewed to assess temporal CT changes and the COVID CT-severity score., RESULTS: A total of 76 out of 170 patients (44.7%) developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease. The majority PE-positive patients were hospitalized in non-intensive wards. PE-positive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PE-negative ones. In the three months of study, overall 85.9% of patients were discharged while 14.1% died, of whom 13 PE-positive (54.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection present a higher cumulative incidence of PE compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, regardless of the severity of lung inflammation or the temporal stage of the disease.	false

0	Detection and Quantification of Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Provides Enhanced Sensitivity, Specificity and Utility. Background: Accurate and sensitive detection of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 remains an essential component of the pandemic response. Measuring antibody that predicts neutralising activity and the vaccine response is an absolute requirement for laboratory-based confirmatory and reference activity.<br><br>Methods: The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) constitutes the prime target antigen for neutralising antibody. A double antigen binding assay (DABA) provides the most sensitive format. It has been exploited in a novel hybrid manner employing an S1 solid-phase preferentially presenting RBD once solid-phase bound, coupled with a labelled RBD conjugate, used in a two-step sequential assay.<br><br>Findings: This assay showed a specificity of 100% on 825 pre COVID-19 samples and a potential sensitivity of 99.6% on 276 recovery samples, predicting quantitatively the presence of neutralising antibody determined by pseudo-type neutralisation and by plaque reduction. Anti-RBD is also measurable in ferrets immunised with ChadOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The early response at presentation with illness, elevated responsiveness with disease severity, detection of asymptomatic seroconversion and persistence after the loss of antibody to the nucleoprotein (anti-NP) are all documented.<br><br>Trial Registration: The ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study was registered at https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN66726260 and designated an Urgent Public Health Research Study by NIHR.<br><br>Interpretation: The hybrid DABA displays the attributes necessary for an antibody test to be used in both clinical and reference serology. It allows the neutralising antibody response to be inferred early in infection and potentially in vaccine recipients. It is also of sufficient sensitivity to be used to provide serological confirmation of prior infection and provides a more secure measure for seroprevalence studies in the population generally than does anti-NP based on the Architect platform.<br><br>Funding: This work is variously supported by grants from: the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR; award CO-CIN-01), the Medical Research Council (MRC; grant MC_PC_19059 and MC_PC_19078), MRC NIHR (grant&nbsp;CV220-111) and by the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections at University of Liverpool in partnership with Public Health England (PHE), in collaboration with Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxford (award 200907), NIHR HPRU in Respiratory Infections at Imperial College London with PHE (award 200927), Wellcome Trust and Department for International Development (DID; 215091/Z/18/Z), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1209135), Liverpool Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (grant reference C18616/A25153), NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Imperial College London (IS-BRC-1215-20013), EU Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics (PREPARE; FP7 project 602525), and NIHR Clinical Research Network for providing infrastructure support for this research.<br><br>Declaration of Interests: RST, MOM and PC report patent pending (Patent Application No. 2011047.4 for “SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection assay).

0	Multicohort Analysis of Publicly-available Monocyte Expression Data Identifies Gene Signatures to Accurately Monitor Subset-specific Changes in Human Diseases. Monocytes and monocyte-derived cells play important roles in the regulation of inflammation, both as precursors as well as effector cells. Monocytes are heterogeneous and characterized by three distinct subsets in humans. Classical and non-classical monocytes represent the most abundant subsets, each carrying out distinct biological functions. Consequently, altered frequencies of different subsets have been associated with inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune disorders including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, more recently, COVID-19. Dissecting the contribution of different monocyte subsets to disease is currently limited by samples and cohorts, often resulting in underpowered studies and, consequently, poor reproducibility. Public transcriptomes provide an alternative source of data characterized by high statistical power and real world heterogeneity. However, most transcriptome datasets profile bulk blood or tissue samples, requiring the use of in silico approaches to quantify changes in the levels of specific cell types. Here, we integrated 853 publicly available microarray expression profiles of sorted human monocyte subsets from 45 independent studies to identify robust and parsimonious gene expression signatures, consisting of 10 genes specific to each subset. These signatures, although derived using only datasets profiling healthy individuals, maintain their accuracy independent of the disease state in an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing (AUC = 1.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our signatures are specific to monocyte subsets compared to other immune cells such as B, T, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells (AUC = 0.87~0.88, p<2.2e-16). This increased specificity results in estimated monocyte subset levels that are strongly correlated with cytometry-based quantification of cellular subsets (r = 0.69, p = 6.7e-4). Consequently, we show that these monocyte subset-specific signatures can be used to quantify changes in monocyte subsets levels in expression profiles from patients in clinical trials. Finally, we show that proteins encoded by our signature genes can be used in cytometry-based assays to specifically sort monocyte subsets. Our results demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and utility of our computational approach and provide a framework for the discovery of new cellular markers.	false
0	Lipid-based vaccine nanoparticles for induction of humoral immune responses against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The current health crisis of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the urgent need for vaccine systems that can generate potent and protective immune responses. Protein vaccines are safe, but conventional approaches for protein-based vaccines often fail to elicit potent and long-lasting immune responses. Nanoparticle vaccines designed to co-deliver protein antigens and adjuvants can promote their delivery to antigen-presenting cells and improve immunogenicity. However, it remains challenging to develop vaccine nanoparticles that can preserve and present conformational epitopes of protein antigens for induction of neutralizing antibody responses. Here, we have designed a new lipid-based nanoparticle vaccine platform (NVP) that presents viral proteins (HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 antigens) in a conformational manner for induction of antigen-specific antibody responses. We show that NVP was readily taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promoted DC maturation and antigen presentation. NVP loaded with BG505.SOSIP.664 (SOSIP) or SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was readily recognized by neutralizing antibodies, indicating the conformational display of antigens on the surfaces of NVP. Rabbits immunized with SOSIP-NVP elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1. Furthermore, mice immunized with RBD-NVP induced robust and long-lasting antibody responses against RBD from SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that NVP is a promising platform technology for vaccination against infectious pathogens. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Utility of Hypertonic Saline and Diazepam in COVID-19-Related Hydroxychloroquine Toxicity. BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) poisoning is a life-threatening but treatable toxic ingestion. The scale of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and the controversial suggestion that HCQ is a treatment option have led to a significant increase in HCQ use. HCQ poisoning should be at the top-of-mind for emergency providers in cases of toxic ingestion. Treatment for HCQ poisoning includes sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and aggressive electrolyte repletion. We highlight the use of hypertonic saline and diazepam., CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 37-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after the ingestion of approximately 16 g of HCQ tablets (initial serum concentration 4270 ng/mL). He was treated with an epinephrine infusion, hypertonic sodium chloride, high-dose diazepam, sodium bicarbonate, and aggressive potassium repletion. Persistent altered mental status necessitated intubation, and he was managed in the medical intensive care unit until his QRS widening and QTc prolongation resolved. After his mental status improved and it was confirmed that his ingestion was not with the intent to self-harm, he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: For patients presenting with HCQ overdose and an unknown initial serum potassium level, high-dose diazepam and hypertonic sodium chloride should be started immediately for the patient with widened QRS. The choice of hypertonic sodium chloride instead of sodium bicarbonate is to avoid exacerbating underlying hypokalemia which may in turn potentiate unstable dysrhythmia. In addition, early intubation should be a priority in vomiting patients because both HCQ toxicity and high-dose diazepam cause profound sedation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Antibody response among nucleic acid amplification test confirmed COVID-19-positive patients: A cross-sectional study. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused immense loss of lives, enormous devastation, and has affected lives globally. Timely diagnosis is necessary to contain its spread. While it is important to test symptomatic individuals and high-risk contacts through reliable and confirmatory test (nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT]) to find out the positive cases of COVID-19, it is also vital to check their immunity status through the serological tests to find out the varied immunological response in the affected population. Materials and Methods: All NAAT confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the study. With a repeat respiratory sample for NAAT, simultaneous serum sample was taken for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies. Data were compiled and analyzed statistically. Results: During the first repeat NAAT, 71.43% had mounted an antibody response, whereas 28.57% had no response. Irrespective of the antibody status, 68.57% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus in NAAT. Although the number dwindled on second repeat NAAT, it raised important questions regarding humoral response and its clinical and diagnostic applicability. Conclusion: Not all, COVID-19 patients mount a humoral response due to yet unexplained factors. Furthermore, exclusive dependence on serology assays will miss the diagnosis in these patients. More research is needed for description and applicability of humoral response in COVID-19 patients.	false

0	Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein vaccine against COVID-19 in adults: pooled analysis of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials. <h4>Summary</h4> <h4>Background</h4> A safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. <h4>Methods</h4> We did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive three doses of vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085 . <h4>Findings</h4> Between June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2 study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants receiving either 25 μg or 50 μg dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25 μg group) and 93% (the 50 μg group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study. The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 μg group and 117.8 for the 50 μg group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 μg group and 69.1 for the 50 μg group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced T H 1 and T H 2 responses. The 50 μg group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 μg group. <h4>Interpretation</h4> The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25 μg vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale evaluation for safety and efficacy. <h4>Funding</h4> National Program on Key Research Project of China, National Science and Technology Major Projects of Drug Discovery, Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical.	false
0	Protein corona components of polyethylene glycol-conjugated organosilica nanoparticles modulates macrophage uptake. Fluorescent organosilica nanoparticles (FNP) conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) of variant molecular weight (2 K, 12 K, 20 K, and 30 K) were prepared to investigate their cellular uptake by murine-derived macrophages. In a medium with FBS, the cellular uptake of FNP-PEGs was decreased as compared to a medium without FBS, indicating that protein corona on FNP-PEGs reduced cellular uptake. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hemoglobin (Hb) were detected as the most abundant components on all FNP-PEGs. Pre-coating of FNP-PEGs with BSA and Hb reduced the macrophage uptake in a medium without FBS, suggesting that these components might strengthen the stealth function of PEGs. Furthermore, there was more reduction in uptake of BSA- and Hb-coated FNP-PEGs from a medium with FBS than without FBS. BSA and Hb could be the stealth enhancement protein of FNP-PEGs in vitro.

0	European context of the diversity and phylogenetic position of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Polish COVID-19 patients. To provide a comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity in Poland in the European context. All publicly available (n = 115; GISAID database) whole-genome SARS-Cov-2 sequences from Polish samples, including those obtained during coronavirus testing performed in our COVID-19 Lab, were examined. Multiple sequence alignment of Polish isolates, phylogenetic analysis (ML tree), and multidimensional scaling (based on the pairwise DNA distances) were complemented by the comparison of the coronavirus clades frequency and diversity in the subset of over 5000 European GISAID sequences. Approximately seventy-seven percent of isolates in the European dataset carried frequent and ubiquitously found haplotypes; the remaining haplotype diversity was population-specific and resulted from population-specific mutations, homoplasies, and recombinations. Coronavirus strains circulating in Poland represented the variability found in other European countries. The prevalence of clades circulating in Poland was shifted in favor of GR, both in terms of the diversity (number of distinct haplotypes) and the frequency (number of isolates) of the clade. Polish-specific haplotypes were rare and could be explained by changes affecting common European strains. The analysis of the whole viral genomes allowed detection of several tight clusters of isolates, presumably reflecting local outbreaks. New mutations, homoplasies, and, to a smaller extent, recombinations increase SARS-CoV-2 haplotype diversity, but the majority of these variants do not increase in frequency and remains rare and population-specific. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in the Polish dataset reflects many independent transfers from a variety of sources, followed by many local outbreaks. The prevalence of the sequences belonging to the GR clade among Polish isolates is consistent with the European trend of the GR clade frequency increase.	false
0	Metagenomic Profiling of Viruses Associated with Rhipicephalus microplus Ticks in Yunnan Province, China. Ticks are well known as vectors of many viruses which usually do great harm to human and animal health. Yunnan Province, widely covered by flourishing vegetation and mainly relying on farming husbandry, is abundant with Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the viral profile present in R. microplus parasitizing on cattle in Yunnan Province. In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan. These viruses consist of single-stranded, circular and segmented sense RNAs, showing a greatly diversity in genomic organization. Furthermore, continuous epidemiological survey among ticks reveals broad prevalence of three viruses (Yunnan mivirus 1, Wuhan tick vrius 1 and YN tick-associated phlebovirus 1) and two possible prevalent viruses including a flavivirus-like segmented virus (Jingmen tick virus) and a bovine hokovirus 2 in Yunnan. Serological investigation among cattle indicates that these identified viruses may be infectious to cattle and can elicit corresponding antibody. Our findings on R. microplus-associated viral community will contribute to the prevention of viral disease and tracking the viral evolution. Further analysis is needed to better elucidate the pathogenicity and natural circulation of these viruses.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection Presenting With Cheilitis and Fever in a Toddler. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly found infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first observed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. An otherwise healthy 13-month-old male presented with persistent fever and cheilitis as his initial findings of COVID-19 in April 2020 prior to the discovery and classification of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are still evolving in the pediatric population, ranging from being asymptomatic to varied symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and myocarditis. Other manifestations such as conjunctivitis and cheilitis can offer clues. We speculate that cheilitis can be a sign of the hyperinflammatory state, as seen in MIS-C.

Although Miller Fisher syndrome cases have been published in this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, anti-GQ1b antibody has not been identified so far. A direct proof of association is not yet available since the exact pathophysiology is not known. Using a proof of contradiction argument, lack of GQ1b serves as the indirect proof that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is probably the infection preceding demyelination.

0	Risk factors associated with mortality of COVID-19 in 3125 counties of the United States. BACKGROUND: The number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States has risen sharply since March 2020. A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood., METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in our statistical analysis., RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties., CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may help decision makers, the public health officials, and the general public better control the risk of pandemic, particularly in the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.	false
0	Incidence of symptomatic, image-confirmed venous thromboembolism following hospitalization for COVID-19 with 90-day follow-up. Although COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of VTE and bleeding after hospitalization for COVID-19 remains unclear, and the optimal hospital VTE prevention strategy is not known. We collected retrospective observational data on thrombosis and bleeding in 303 consecutive adult patients admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours for COVID-19. Patients presenting with VTE on admission were excluded. Data were collected until 90 days after admission or known death by using medical records and an established national VTE network. Maximal level of care was ward based in 78% of patients, with 22% requiring higher dependency care (12% noninvasive ventilation, 10% invasive ventilation). Almost all patients (97.0%) received standard thromboprophylaxis or were already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (17.5%). Symptomatic image-confirmed VTE occurred in 5.9% of patients during index hospitalization, and in 7.2% at 90 days after admission (23.9% in patients requiring higher dependency care); half the events were isolated segmental or subsegmental defects on lung imaging. Bleeding occurred in 13 patients (4.3%) during index hospitalization (1.3% had major bleeding). The majority of bleeds occurred in patients on the general ward, and 6 patients were receiving treatment-dose anticoagulation, highlighting the need for caution in intensifying standard thromboprophylaxis strategies. Of 152 patients discharged from the hospital without an indication for anticoagulation, 97% did not receive thromboprophylaxis after discharge, and 3% received 7 days of treatment with low molecular weight heparin after discharge. The rate of symptomatic VTE in this group at 42 days after discharge was 2.6%, highlighting the need for large prospective randomized controlled trials of extended thromboprophylaxis after discharge in COVID-19.

0	Racial/ethnic and Income Disparities in the Prevalence of Comorbidities that Are Associated With Risk for Severe COVID-19 Among Adults Receiving HIV Care, United States, 2014-2019. BACKGROUND: Health inequities among people with HIV may be compounded by disparities in the prevalence of comorbidities associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19., SETTING: Complex sample survey designed to produce nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical characteristics of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States., METHODS: We estimated prevalence of having >=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19 and prevalence differences (PD) by race/ethnicity, income level, and type of health insurance. We considered PDs >=5 percentage points to be meaningful from a public health perspective., RESULTS: An estimated 37.9% (95% CI, 36.6 to 39.2) of adults receiving HIV care had >=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks or African Americans were more likely (adjusted prevalence difference [APD], 7.8 percentage points [95% CI, 5.7 to 10.0]) and non-Hispanic Asians were less likely (APD, -13.7 percentage points [95% CI, -22.3 to -5.0]) to have >=1 diagnosed comorbidity after adjusting for age differences. There were no meaningful differences between non-Hispanic Whites and adults in other racial/ethnic groups. Those with low income, were more likely to have >=1 diagnosed comorbidity (PD, 7.3 percentage points [95% CI, 5.1 to 9.4])., CONCLUSIONS: Among adults receiving HIV care, non-Hispanic Blacks and those with low income were more likely to have >=1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Building health equity among people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic may require reducing the impact of comorbidities in heavily affected communities.

0	Technical considerations to development of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact worldwide and has brought clinical assays both for acute diagnosis and prior exposure determination to the forefront. Serological testing intended for point-of-care or laboratory use can be used to determine more accurate individual and population assessments of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2; improve our understanding of the degree to which immunity is conveyed to subsequent exposures; and quantify immune response to future vaccines. In response to this pandemic, initially more than 90 companies deployed serology assays to the U.S. market, many of which made overstated claims for their accuracy, regulatory approval status, and utility for intended purpose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration subsequently instituted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) procedure requiring that manufacturers submit validation data, but allowing newly developed serological tests to be marketed without the usual approval process during this crisis. Although this rapid deployment was intended to benefit public health, the incomplete understanding of immune response to the virus and lack of assay vetting resulted in quality issues with some of these tests, and thus many were withdrawn after submission. Common assay platforms include lateral flow assays which can serve an important niche of low cost, rapid turnaround, and increased accessibility whereas established laboratory-based platforms based on ELISAs and chemiluminescence expand existing technologies to SARS-CoV-2 and can provide throughput and quantification capabilities. While most of the currently EUA assays rely on these well-established platforms, despite their apparent technical simplicity, there are numerous practical challenges both for manufacturers in developing and for end-users in running and interpreting such assays. Within are discussed technical challenges to serology development for SARS-CoV-2, with an emphasis on lateral flow assay technology. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	Periodontal tissues are targets for Sars-Cov-2: a post-mortem study. Background: The ability of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to spread is one of the determinants of the COVID-19 pandemic status. Until June 2020, global COVID-19 cases surpassed 10 million. Asymptomatic patients, with no respiratory impairment, are believed to be responsible for more than 80% of the transmission. Other viruses have been consistently detected in periodontal tissues. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissue. Methods: We conducted video-endoscope minimally invasive post-mortem biopsy in seven fatal cases of COVID-19, using a regular endoscope video system associated with a smartphone to locate periodontal tissue. We analyzed the samples using RT-PCR, to identify the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and histopathological analysis. Results: The seven studied autopsies with positive laboratory tests for COVID-19 included 57.14% of female patients at the average age of 47.4 (range 8 to 74). In five cases, periodontal tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). Histopathologic analyses showed morphologic alterations in the keratinocytes of the junctional epithelium, a vacuolization of the cytoplasm and nucleus and nuclear pleomorphism. Conclusion:  We presented a biomolecular analysis obtained from minimally invasive autopsies. This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in periodontal tissue in COVID-19 positive patients. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Risk factors for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A cross-sectional study in 116,678 people. <h4>Background</h4> The risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission are not well characterised in Western populations. We sought to identify potential risk factors for transmission and actionable information to prevent for SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Methods</h4> Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 at four major laboratories were invited. In addition, participants were sampled by convenience after a media campaign. Self-reported test results were compared with laboratory results, demographic data and behavioural facts were collected using a digital platform. In a cross-sectional design positive cases were compared with negative and untested control groups. <h4>Findings</h4> Approximately 14 days after a countrywide lockdown in Norway, 116,678 participants were included. Median age was 46 years, 44% had children in preschool or in school; 18% were practicing health professionals. International flights, contact with infected, and gatherings of more than 50 people, were associated with high risk. Health professionals who used public transport were at higher risk of testing positive than those who did not. Having undergone light infections, the last six months was strongly associated with lower odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Contact with children, use of hand sanitiser and use of protective gloves in private were also associated with lower odds ratio of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Further research is needed to explore if being a parent or looking after children is associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the next phases of the pandemic. Immunological research should be done to determine the effects of prior trivial infections on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We confirm that large gatherings during the pandemic should be avoided and those who are infected, or under suspicion thereof, posed very high risks to others this population.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a pro-thrombotic platelet phenotype. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a hypercoagulable state, characterized by abnormal coagulation parameters and by increased incidence of cardiovascular complications. With this study, we aimed to investigate the activation state and the expression of transmembrane proteins in platelets of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We investigated transmembrane proteins expression with a customized mass cytometry panel of 21 antibodies. Platelets of 8 hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring intensive care support and without pre-existing conditions were compared to platelets of healthy controls (11 donors) with and without in vitro stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). Mass cytometry of non-stimulated platelets detected an increased surface expression of activation markers P-Selectin (0.67 vs. 1.87 median signal intensity for controls vs. patients, p = 0.0015) and LAMP-3 (CD63, 0.37 vs. 0.81, p = 0.0004), the GPIIb/IIIa complex (4.58 vs. 5.03, p < 0.0001) and other adhesion molecules involved in platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Upon TRAP stimulation, mass cytometry detected a higher expression of P-selectin in COVID-19 samples compared to controls (p < 0.0001). However, we observed a significantly reduced capacity of COVID-19 platelets to increase the expression of activation markers LAMP-3 and P-Selectin upon stimulation with TRAP. We detected a hyperactivated phenotype in platelets during SARS-CoV-2 infection, consisting of highly expressed platelet activation markers, which might contribute to the hypercoagulopathy observed in COVID-19. In addition, several transmembrane proteins were more highly expressed compared to healthy controls. These findings support research projects investigating antithrombotic and antiplatelet treatment regimes in COVID-19 patients, and provide new insights on the phenotypical platelet expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of deceased hemodialysis patients affected by COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern. In China, Wuhan, Hubei Province was the epicenter. The disease is more severe in patients with high comorbidities and dialysis patients fall into this category., METHODS: In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Wuhan NO.1 Hospital by 28 February 2020. We compared the differences on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features between patients surviving from COVID-19 and patients who died., RESULT: In this hospital, at time of the present report, 627 patients were on chronic hemodialysis and the prevalence of affected cases was 11.8% (74/627). The median age of the COVID-19-positive patients was 63 years (range 31-88), with an almost even gender distribution (females accounted for 54.4%). The most frequent presenting symptom was cough (41.9%), followed by fatigue (24.2%), fever (17.2%) and dyspnea (14.8%); 22.4% of the cases were and asymptomatic. Fourteen of the 74 patients died (19%), as for presenting symptoms, cough was more frequent in patients who died (P < 0.05). Surviving patients had higher levels of phosphate and albumin, and lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest CT scan was positive in all cases, including in asymptomatic ones, and revealed in about three fourths of the cases bilateral (76.2%) lesions; in each lung lesions were multiple in about half of the cases of the cases (52.3%). After diagnosis, median time to death was 7 days in the 14 patients who died, with a range between 4 and 18 days., CONCLUSION: This preliminary, single Center study identifies hemodialysis patients as a population at high risk of severe, and deadly COVID-19 infection. While classic baseline clinical conditions, including age, kidney disease and gender, are not significantly associated with survival in COVID-19 infected hemodialysis, our study also suggests a significant association between risk of and death, poor nutritional status and less than optimal metabolic balance.	false
0	Differential serological and neutralizing antibody dynamics after an infection by a single SARS-CoV-2 strain. BACKGROUND: We report here the case of two coworkers infected by the same SARS-CoV-2 strain, presenting two different immunological outcomes., CASE: One patient presented a strong IgG anti-receptor-binding domain immune response correlated with a low and rapidly decreasing titer of neutralizing antibodies. The other patient had a similar strong IgG anti-receptor-binding domain immune response but high neutralizing antibody titers., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Thus, host individual factors may be the main drivers of the immune response varying with age and clinical severity.	false
0	Complement Factors in COVID-19 Therapeutics and Vaccines. Complement is integral to a healthy functioning immune system and orchestrates various innate and adaptive responses against viruses and other pathogens. Despite its importance, the potential beneficial role of complement in immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been overshadowed by reports of extensive complement activation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we hypothesize that complement may also have a protective role and could function to enhance virus neutralization by antibodies, promote virus phagocytosis by immune cells, and lysis of virus. These functions might be exploited in the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	"The Influence of the COVID-19 Event on Deviant Workplace Behavior Taking Tianjin, Beijing and Hebei as an Example. Background: Since the beginning of 2020, the Corona Virus Disease has broken out globally. This public health incident has had a great impact on the work and life of the public. Aim: Based on the event system theory, this article explored the influence of the ""COVID-19"" event on emotional exhaustion and deviant workplace behaviors. Methods: This survey's objects are employees working in Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei affected by the epidemic. Using the questionnaire star, the online platform of the Marketing Research Office of Peking University and ""snowball"" methods 700 questionnaires were collected. Results: The response rate was 89.71% (n = 700). Female employees are more sensitive to the perceived event strength of the novel coronavirus pneumonia than male employees (F = 10.94, p <0.001); Employees aged 30-40 affected by the epidemic have the highest level of emotional exhaustion (F = 5.22, p < 0.01); A higher education level leads to a higher level of emotional exhaustion (F = 4.74, p < 0.01); The emotional exhaustion is polarized with the annual family income (F = 4.099, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The novelty, disruption, criticality of the Corona Virus Disease event has had a positive impact on the emotional exhaustion of employees in the workplace; Emotional exhaustion plays a partly mediating role between event strength with constructive deviant behaviors, and destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a positive effect on creative constructive deviant behaviors, challenging constructive deviant behaviors, and interpersonal destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a negative impact on organizational destructive deviant behaviors, and has no significant impact on interpersonal constructive deviant behaviors."	false
0	The risk of over-diagnosis in serological testing. Implications for communications strategies. BACKGROUND: since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of developing a serological test has emerged and a debate on test accuracy and reliability become an issue widely discussed in the media. The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation., OBJECTIVES: to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value., METHODS: the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test., RESULTS: at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial., CONCLUSIONS: the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions.	false
0	Association between iron status and the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Iron is an essential trace element to almost all organism, and the delicate balance between host defend system and viral proliferation plays an important role in infective conditions. While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients., RESULTS: We identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (IQR: 17-40). After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

0	SARS-CoV-2: An insight into detection tools. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was announced as a pandemic in March 2020. Different diagnostic laboratory tests have been used to detect the infection. Each diagnostic tool, such as Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging, genome sequencing, nucleic acid amplification methods, whole genome sequencing, microarray, and serology testing have several advantages and disadvantages. Nucleic acid amplification methods are better diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in early stages of the infection, while serological tests are more appropriate for the recognition of previously infected patients. In this review, we will briefly consider each diagnostic method, and discuss its pros and cons. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.	false

0	Effectiveness of Physical Distancing: Staying 6 Feet Over to Put Respiratory Viruses 6 Feet Under. Community transmission of severe acute respiratory illness Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Arizona was noted in March 2020. It was our hypothesis that the associated implementation of physical distancing and masking led to a decline in circulation and detection of common respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs processed with the Biofire, Film Array respiratory panel at Mayo Clinic Arizona were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. A total of 13,324 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses.

0	Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19-Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a 5-year-old. Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that ranges from mild symptoms to cardiopulmonary collapse. A 5-year-old girl presented with shock and a rapid decline in left ventricular function requiring intubation. SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by viral Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and she received remdesivir and COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Initial echocardiogram (ECHO) demonstrated low normal left ventricular function and mild left anterior descending coronary artery dilation. She remained hypotensive, despite high-dose epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions as well as stress-dose hydrocortisone. Admission SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was positive, meeting the criteria for MIS-C. An ECHO 9 hours after admission demonstrated a severe decline in left ventricular function. Due to severe cardiogenic shock, she was cannulated for venoarterial extracorporeal support (ECMO). During her ECMO course, she was treated with remdesivir, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anakinra. She was decannulated on ECMO day 7, extubated the following day, and discharged home 2 weeks later without respiratory or cardiac support. The use of ECMO for cardiopulmonary support for pediatric patients with MIS-C is feasible and should be considered early as part of the treatment algorithm for patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction.	false
0	COVID-19 ARDS is characterized by a dysregulated host response that differs from cytokine storm and may be modified by dexamethasone. We performed comparative lower respiratory tract transcriptional profiling of 52 critically ill patients with ARDS from COVID-19 or other etiologies, or without ARDS. We found no evidence of cytokine storm but instead observed complex host response dysregulation driven by genes with non-canonical roles in inflammation and immunity that were predicted to be modulated by dexamethasone. Compared to other viral ARDS, COVID-19 was characterized by impaired interferon-stimulated gene expression.	false
0	High prevalence of diabetes and other comorbidities in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Delhi, India, and their association with outcomes. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the prevalence and impact of diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities among hospitalized patients with COVID-19., METHODS: In a prospective, observational study including consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID-19, clinical outcomes and inflammatory markers were compared in those with and without diabetes. Participants were classified as having mild or severe COVID-19 disease using the WHO ordinal scale., RESULTS: 401 patients (125 females) with median age of 54 years (range 19-92) were evaluated. Of them 189 (47.1%) had pre-existing diabetes and21 (5.2%) had new-onset hyperglycaemia. Overall, 344 (85.8%) and 57 (14.2%) cases had mild and severe COVID-19 disease respectively. The group with diabetes had a higher proportion of severe cases (20.1% vs 9%, p-0.002), mortality (6.3 vs 1.4%, p-0.015), ICU admission (24.3 vs 12.3%, p-0.002), and oxygen requirement (53.4 vs 28.3%, p < 0.001). Baseline Hba1c (n = 331) correlated significantly with outcome severity scores (r 0.136, p-0.013) and 12/15 (80%) of those who succumbed had diabetes. Hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease were present in 164 (40.9%), 35 (8.7%) and 12 (2.99%) patients respectively. Hypertension was associated with a higher proportion of severe cases, mortality, ICU admission and oxygen administration., CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of diabetes in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Patients with diabetes or hypertension had more severe disease and greater mortality. Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Comprehensive comparison of transcriptomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection: alternative entry routes and innate immune responses. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 emerges as complex, with multiple factors leading to injury of different organs. Several studies on underlying cellular processes have produced contradictory claims, e.g. on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry or innate immune responses. However, clarity in these matters is imperative for therapy development. We therefore performed a meta-study with a diverse set of transcriptomes under infections with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including data from different cells and COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses. First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TM-PRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2. Second, we find that innate immune responses in terms of interferons and interferon simulated genes are strong in relevant cells, for example Calu3 cells, but vary markedly with cell type, virus dose, and virus type.	false
0	Comparing the age and sex trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity with other respiratory pathogens points to potential immune mechanisms. Comparing age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and mortality with influenza and other health outcomes opens the way to generating hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms, building on the extraordinary advances in immunology and physiology that have occurred over the last year. Notable departures in health outcomes starting around puberty suggest that burdens associated with influenza and other causes are reduced relative to the two emergent coronaviruses over much of adult life. Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin-system in SARS-CoV-2 infection might drive high sensitivity to disruptions of homeostasis. Overall, these results highlight the long tail of vulnerability in the age profile relevant to the emergent coronaviruses, which more transmissible variants have the potential to uncover at the younger end of the scale, and aging populations will expose at the other end of the scale.	false
0	Rituximab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis: a review. In the last decades, evidence suggesting the direct or indirect involvement of B cells on multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis has accumulated. The increased amount of data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell-depleting therapies from several studies has suggested the addition of these drugs as treatment options to the current armamentarium of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS. Particularly, rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 positive B lymphocytes resulting in cell-mediated apoptosis, has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory activity, incidence of relapses and new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Additional evidence also demonstrated that patients with progressive MS (PMS) may benefit from RTX, which also showed to be well tolerated, with acceptable safety risks and favorable cost-effectiveness profile.Despite these encouraging results, RTX is currently approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, several forms of vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, while it can only be administered off-label for MS treatment. Between Northern European countries exist different rules for using not licensed drug for treating MS. The Sweden MS register reports a high rate (53.5%) of off-label RTX prescriptions in relation to other annually started DMTs to treat MS patients, while Danish and Norwegian neurologists have to use other anti-CD20 drugs, as ocrelizumab, in most of the cases. In this paper, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety profile and cost effectiveness aspects of RTX for the treatment of MS. Particularly, with the approval of new anti-CD20 DMTs, the recent worldwide COVID-19 emergency and the possible increased risk of infection with this class of drugs, this review sheds light on the use of RTX as an alternative treatment option for MS management, while commenting the gaps of knowledge regarding this drug.	false
0	Malaria and COVID-19: unmasking their ties. The incidence and mortality of COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization reports, shows a noticeable difference between North America, Western Europe, and South Asia on one hand and most African countries on the other hand, especially the malaria-endemic countries. Although this observation could be attributed to limited testing capacity, mitigation tools adopted and cultural habits, many theories have been postulated to explain this difference in prevalence and mortality. Because death tends to occur more in elders, both the role of demography, and how the age structure of a population may contribute to the difference in mortality rate between countries were discussed. The variable distribution of the ACEI/D and the ACE2 (C1173T substitution) polymorphisms has been postulated to explain this variable prevalence. Up-to-date data regarding the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) in COVID-19 have been summarized. The article also sheds lights on how the similarity of malaria and COVID-19 symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis of one disease for the other or overlooking the possibility of co-infection. As the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the delivery of malaria services, such as the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying, as well as malaria chemoprevention there is an urgent need for rapid and effective responses to avoid malaria outbreaks.	false
0	Association of substance use disorders and drug overdose with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in New York City: January-October 2020. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that individuals with history of substance use disorder (SUD) are at increased risk of COVID-19, but little is known about relationships between SUDs, overdose and COVID-19 severity and mortality. This study investigated risks of severe COVID-19 among patients with SUDs., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of data from a hospital system in New York City. Patient records from 1 January to 26 October 2020 were included. We assessed positive COVID-19 tests, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and death. Descriptive statistics and bivariable analyses compared the prevalence of COVID-19 by baseline characteristics. Logistic regression estimated unadjusted and sex-, age-, race- and comorbidity-adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for associations between SUD history, overdose history and outcomes., RESULTS: Of patients tested for COVID-19 (n = 188 653), 2.7% (n = 5107) had any history of SUD. Associations with hospitalization [AORs (95% confidence interval)] ranged from 1.78 (0.85-3.74) for cocaine use disorder (COUD) to 6.68 (4.33-10.33) for alcohol use disorder. Associations with ICU admission ranged from 0.57 (0.17-1.93) for COUD to 5.00 (3.02-8.30) for overdose. Associations with death ranged from 0.64 (0.14-2.84) for COUD to 3.03 (1.70-5.43) for overdose., DISCUSSION: Patients with histories of SUD and drug overdose may be at elevated risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

0	Estimation of US SARS-CoV-2 Infections, Symptomatic Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths Using Seroprevalence Surveys. Importance: Estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease burden are needed to help guide interventions., Objective: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16596], May, June, and July [n = 40817], and August [n = 38355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers., Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden., Results: Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16596), May (n = 14291), June (n = 14159), July (n = 12367), and August (n = 38355), there were estimated medians of 46910006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38192705-60814748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28122752 (IQR, 23014957-36438592) symptomatic infections, 956174 (IQR, 782509-1238912) hospitalizations, and 304915 (IQR, 248253-395296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020., Conclusions and Relevance: The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines.	false
0	Characteristic of Parkinson's disease with severe COVID-19: a study of 10 cases from Wuhan. Information about Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with severe COVID-19 is scarce. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors affecting the prognosis of PD patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Clinical data of severe COVID-19 patients admitted at the Union Hospital, Wuhan between 28th January and 29th February 2020 were collected and analyzed. 10 patients (1.96%) had a medical history of PD with a mean (SD) age of 72.10 (+/- 11.46) years. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe COVID-19 with and without PD patients were then compared. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the PD and non-PD patients with severe COVID-19 (p > 0.05). In PD patients with severe COVID-19, the proportion of patients with critical type, disturbance of consciousness, incidence of complications, white blood cells count and neutrophils counts on admission seem higher in the non-survivors. PD patients with older age, longer PD duration, and late stage PD may be highly susceptible to critical COVID-19 infection and bad outcome. The PD patients with consciousness disorders and complications that progressed rapidly are at increased risk of death.	false
0	Appendicitis in Children in a Large Italian COVID-19 Pandemic Area. Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the routine activities of pediatric surgical centers, and it determined the reduction of admissions in the pediatric emergency departments (PED). We reviewed the records of patients affected by acute appendicitis (AA) during the COVID-19 pandemic period in a large Italian COVID-19 pandemic area. Methods: Data regarding demographics, age, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and time between symptom onset and PED admission of patients affected by confirmed AA in the period between March and April 2020 were considered. The data were compared with those obtained during the same period of 2019, 2018, and 2017 in the included centers. Data were quoted as median (range) or absolute number. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare groups. A p <= 0.05 was regarded as significant. Since only anonymous data have been used and the data storage meets current data protection regulations, ethical committee approval was not required for this study. Results: Eighty-six patients underwent surgical appendectomy for AA between February 20th, 2020 and April 20th, 2020; 32.5% were complicated appendicitis and 67.5% were uncomplicated. Fifty-three patients were males and 33 were females. Patients' age ranged from 3 to 17 years and the median age was 10 years. The median time between the onset of symptoms and the admission in PED was 1.85 days. The average time between the symptom onset and PED admission was 1.8 days. Conclusions: Although fear from the COVID-19 pandemic determined a delayed diagnosis of serious pediatric diseases, the increasing prevalence and severity of AA were not demonstrated in the most COVID-19-affected areas of Italy.

0	An Up-to-Date Overview of Therapeutic Agents for the Treatment of COVID-19 Disease. Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a great potential to overwhelm the world healthcare systems that may lead to high morbidity and mortality. It also affects world economic development in the future. Currently, no proven effective drugs or vaccines are available for the management of COVID-19 disease. The pace of normal drug development progression is unacceptable in the context of the current pandemic. Therefore, repurposing the existing drugs that were used for the treatment of malaria, Ebola, and influenza helps rapid drug development for COVID-19. Currently, several repurposing candidate drugs are in a clinical trial including, chloroquine monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, interferon, and antiviral therapies. Antiviral drugs like arbidol, remdesiv and favirnavir are the most promising due to the similarities of the viruses regarding viral entry, fusion, uncoating, and replication. This review article provides an overview of the potential therapeutic agent, which displayed better clinical treatment outcomes. Moreover, with further understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, new drugs targeting specific SARS-CoV-2 viral components arise, and investigations on these novels anti-SARSCoV- 2 agents are also reviewed.

0	Prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Post-Quarantine Healthcare Workers. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging highly communicable disease. Nosocomial transmission needs to be prevented through the implementation of stringent screening and infection control measures., Objective: The objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers (HCWs) post quarantine period., Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted at a teaching University hospital in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia, during the period between May 1 and June 15, 2020. All (HCWs) joining work back from the quarantine areas had a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. The demographic and clinical data from the staff were collected., Results: Of the 301 HCWs screened, 18 (6%) had positive PCR. The age means of the positive cases was 32.9 Y +/- 8.7 compared to 33.8 Y +/- 7.0 in the negatively tested group (p value = 0.90). Of the 18 PCR-positive HCWs, 7 (38.9%) were male. Majority of those who tested positive were trainees (8.2%) followed by nurses (5.1%). In PCR-positive group, a clear epidemiological exposure was found in 4/18 cases (22.2%). Male gender and residency in specific districts were observed more in the positive cases (p value = 0.01 and 0.0001, respectively). In regards to symptoms, most of the positive PCR tested HCWs (n=12, 66.7%) remained asymptomatic. Most prevalent initial symptoms were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain) in six HCWs representing 33.3%. No significant difference was noted in co-morbidities reported by both groups., Conclusion: Health care workers tested post-quarantine period were found to be at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection despite very minimal or no known risks of exposure, where most of them were asymptomatic. This potentially carries risk of nosocomial transmission inside healthcare facilities. Implanting policies for routine post-quarantine screening for HCWs is recommended.

0	The Impact of the Covid-19 Epidemic on Older Adults in Rural and Urban Areas in Mexico. OBJECTIVES: Mexico is among the countries in Latin America hit hardest by COVID-19. A large proportion of older adults in Mexico have high prevalence of multimorbidity and live in poverty with limited access to health care services. These statistics are even higher among adults living in rural areas, which suggests that older adults in rural communities may be more susceptible to COVID-19. The objectives of the article were to compare clinical and demographic characteristics for people diagnosed with COVID-19 by age group, and to describe cases and mortality in rural and urban communities., METHODS: We linked publicly available from the Mexican Ministry of Health and the Census. Municipalities were classified based on population as rural (<2500), semi-rural (>= 2,500 and <15,000), semi-urban (>=15,000 and <100,000) and urban (>=100,000). Zero-inflated negative binomial models were performed to calculate the total number of COVID-19 cases, and deaths per 1,000,000 persons using the population of each municipality as a denominator., RESULTS: Older adults were more likely to be hospitalized and reported severe cases, with higher mortality rates. In addition, rural municipalities reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases and mortality related to COVID-19 per million than urban municipalities. The adjusted absolute difference in COVID-19 cases was 912.7 per million (95% Confidence Interval (CI),79.0 - 1746.4) and mortality related to COVID-19 was 390.6 per million (95% CI, 204.5 - 576.7)., DISCUSSION: Urgent policy efforts are needed to mandate the use of face masks and encourage handwashing, and improve specialty care for Mexicans in rural areas.

0	The neutralization effect of Montelukast on SARS-CoV-2 is shown by multiscale in silico simulations and combined in vitro studies. Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist Montelukast as a novel agent that simultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initially demonstrated the dual inhibition profile of Montelukast through multiscale molecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based main protease enzyme inhibition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirus neutralization on HEK293T / hACE2, and virus neutralization assay using xCELLigence MP real time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitro results confirmed the dual potential effect of the Montelukast both on virus entry into the host cell (Spike/ACE2) and on the main protease enzyme inhibition. The virus neutralization assay results showed that while no cytotoxicity of the Montelukast was observed at 12 μM concentration, the cell index time 50 (CIT 50 ) value was delayed for 12 hours. Moreover, it was also shown that Favipiravir, a well-known antiviral used in COVID-19 therapy, should be used by 16-fold higher concentrations than Montelukast in order to have the same effect of Montelukast. The rapid use of new small molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized and has been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently be completed in clinical phase studies and if its effect is proven in clinical phase studies, it should be used against COVID-19.	false
0	COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike induce robust T- and B-cell immune responses and full efficacy in mice. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are urgently needed. We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad and polyfunctional S-specific CD4+ (mainly Th1) and CD8+ T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic. IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of December 23, 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs. Our findings prove the robust immunogenicity and efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.

0	Risks of and risk factors for COVID-19 disease in people with diabetes: a cohort study of the total population of Scotland. BACKGROUND: We aimed to ascertain the cumulative risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes and compare it with that of people without diabetes, and to investigate risk factors for and build a cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 among people with diabetes., METHODS: In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from March 1, 2020, when the first case was identified, to July 31, 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation., FINDINGS: Of the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5 463 300), the population with diabetes was 319 349 (5.8%), 1082 (0.3%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89.8%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0.1%) of 5 143 951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1.395 (95% CI 1.304-1.494; p<0.0001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2.396 (1.815-3.163; p<0.0001) in type 1 diabetes and 1.369 (1.276-1.468; p<0.0001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0.0001), and have been a smoker (p=0.0011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0.85 (0.83-0.86)., INTERPRETATION: Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history., FUNDING: None.

0	Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Cohort Patients in Daegu Metropolitan City Outbreak in 2020. BACKGROUND: A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in February 2020 and was controlled at the end of March 2020 in Daegu, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Korea. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Daegu., METHODS: In collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City and Korean Center for Diseases Control, we conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including viral RNA detection, were obtained from the electronic medical records and cohort database and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariate and multi-variable logistic regression methods and Cox regression model and performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the risk factors associated with the 28-day mortality and release from isolation among the patients., RESULTS: In this study, 7,057 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 (total cohort) who had been diagnosed from February 18 to July 10, 2020 were included. Of the total cohort, 5,467 were asymptomatic to mild patients (77.4%) (asymptomatic 30.6% and mild 46.8%), 985 moderate (14.0%), 380 severe (5.4%), and 225 critical (3.2%). The mortality of the patients was 2.5% (179/7,057). The Cox regression hazard model for the patients with available clinical information (core cohort) (n = 2,254) showed the risk factors for 28-day mortality: age > 70 (hazard ratio [HR], 4.219, P = 0.002), need for O2 supply at admission (HR, 2.995; P = 0.001), fever (> 37.5degreeC) (HR, 2.808; P = 0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.119; P = 0.008), cancer (HR, 3.043; P = 0.011), dementia (HR, 5.252; P = 0.008), neurological disease (HR, 2.084; P = 0.039), heart failure (HR, 3.234; P = 0.012), and hypertension (HR, 2.160; P = 0.017). The median duration for release from isolation was 33 days (interquartile range, 24.0-46.0) in survivors. The Cox proportional hazard model for the long duration of isolation included severity, age > 70, and dementia., CONCLUSION: Overall, asymptomatic to mild patients were approximately 77% of the total cohort (asymptomatic, 30.6%). The case fatality rate was 2.5%. Risk factors, including older age, need for O2 supply, dementia, and neurological disorder at admission, could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.

0	Optimality in COVID-19 vaccination strategies determined by heterogeneity in human-human interaction networks. Interactions between humans cause transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in human-human interactions give rise to non-linear infection networks that gain complexity with time. Consequently, targeted vaccination strategies are challenged as such effects are not accurately captured by epidemiological models assuming homogeneous mixing. With vaccines being prepared for global deployment determining optimality for swiftly reaching population level immunity in heterogeneous local communities world-wide is critical. We introduce a model that predicts the effect of vaccination into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak using precision simulation of human-human interaction and infection networks. We show that simulations incorporating non-linear network complexity and local heterogeneity can enable governance with performance-quantified vaccination strategies. Vaccinating highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while vaccinating the elderly reduces fatalities at low population level immunity. Interestingly, a combined strategy is not better due to non-linear effects. While risk groups should be vaccinated first to minimize fatalities, significant optimality branching is observed with increasing population level immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that regardless of immunization strategy non-pharmaceutical interventions are required to prevent ICU overload and breakdown of healthcare systems. The approach, adaptable in real-time and applicable to other viruses, provides a highly valuable platform for the current and future pandemics.	false
0	Protection against reinfection with D614- or G614-SARS-CoV-2 isolates in hamsters. Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented in humans, although its real incidence is currently unknown. Besides having great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.	false
0	[Epidemiological characteristics and measures of prevention and control of imported COVID-19 cases in early phase in Shanghai]. Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases in early phase in Shanghai, introduce measures and provide reference for prevention and control of imported COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data of imported COVID-19 cases in Shanghai reported as of 30 March, 2020 were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System of China CDC and field epidemiological investigation reports by CDCs in Shanghai. The information about measures of prevention and control was collected from official websites and platforms of the governments. Data cleaning and statistical analysis were performed with softwares of EpiData 3.1, Excel 2019 and SAS 9.4. Results: A total of 171 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported as of 30 March, 2020 in Shanghai, including 170 confirmed cases and 1 asymptomatic infection case. Among them, cases of Chinese nationality accounted for 71.3% (122/171) and cases of foreign nationality accounted for 28.7% (49/171). The median age of the cases was 23 years (P(25), P(75): 18, 35 years), and the male to female ratio of the cases was 1.3:1. Students accounted for 56.6% (97/171). About 45.6% (78/171) of the cases fell ill before arriving in Shanghai. The cases with mild or common clinical manifestation accounted for 96.5% (165/171) and no significant difference in clinical type was observed between overseas Chinese cases and foreign cases. The epidemic curve by diagnosis date reached peak on March 24, and the number of the cases gradually declined due to the closed-loop management process of joint port prevention and control mechanism. The 171 imported COVID-19 cases were mainly from 24 countries and regions, including the United Kingdom (64 cases, 37.3%), the United States (32 cases, 18.6%), France (19 cases, 11.0%) and Italy (16 cases, 9.4%). About 40.4% of the cases (69/171) planned to continue travelling to 21 other provinces and municipalities in China. Customs quarantine and community observation/detection points identified 43.9% (75/171) cases and 31.0% (53/171) cases, respectively. Conclusions: The imported COVID-19 cases in early phase in Shanghai were mainly young population and students accounted for high proportion. The imported risk of COVID-19 was consistent with the severity of the epidemic in foreign countries. The closed-loop management model of the joint port prevention and control mechanism plays an important role in the identification and management of the imported COVID-19 cases.	false
0	Early-pandemic wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Southern Nevada: Methodology, occurrence, and incidence/prevalence considerations. The World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic, with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy. Although SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals, thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence. Numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and wastewater-associated solids/sludge. However, the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions, or are instead driven by methodological artifacts. The current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods, detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds from March-May 2020, and better understand the potential link between COVID-19 incidence/prevalence and wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate recovery (0.34%-55%) and equivalent sample volume (0.1 mL-1 L) differed between methods and target water matrices, ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations. Composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a ~10-fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples, presumably highlighting diurnal variability in SARS-CoV-2 signal. Detection and quantification of four SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers (up to ~106 gene copies per liter), along with ratios of SARS-CoV-2 to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), exhibited comparability with public health data for two sewersheds in an early phase of the pandemic. Finally, a wastewater model informed by fecal shedding rates highlighted the potential significance of new cases (i.e., incidence rather than prevalence) when interpreting wastewater surveillance data.

0	COVID-19 immunization threshold(s): an analysis. 2 As COVID-19 vaccine research efforts seem to be yielding the first tangible results, the proportion of individuals needed to reap the benefits of herd immunity is a key element from a Public Health programs perspective. This magnitude, termed the critical immunization threshold ( q ), can be obtained from the classical SIR model equilibrium equation, equaling ( 1 − 1 /R 0 )/ ϵ , where R 0 is the basic reproduction number and ϵ is the vaccine efficacy. When a significant proportion of the population is already immune, this becomes (n − 1 /R 0 )/ ϵ , where n is the proportion of non-immune individuals. A similar equation can be obtained for short-term immunization thresholds( q t ), which are dependent on R t . q s for most countries are between 60-75% of the population. Current q t for most countries are between 20-40%. Therefore, the combination of gradual vaccination and other non-pharmaceutical interventions will mark the transition to the herd immunity, providing that the later turns out to be a feasible objective. Nevertheless, immunization through vaccination is a complex issue and many challenges might appear.	false
0	Evaluation of a multi-sectoral intervention to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in long-term care facilities. OBJECTIVE: A Canadian health authority implemented a multi-sectoral intervention designed to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission during long term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks. The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention 14 days after implementation., DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, segmented regression analysis., INTERVENTION: A series of outbreak measures classified into four categories: case/contact management, proactive case detection, rigorous infection control practices and resource prioritization/stewardship., METHODS: A mixed-effects segmented Poisson regression model was fitted to the incidence rate of COVID-19, calculated every two days, within each facility and case type (staff vs. residents). For each facility, the outbreak time period was segmented into an early outbreak period (within 14 days intervention) and post-intervention period (after 14 days from intervention). Model outputs quantified COVID-19 incidence trend and rate changes between these two periods. A secondary model was constructed to identify effect modification by case type., RESULTS: The significant upward trend in COVID-19 incidence rate during the early outbreak period (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11, p-value<0.001) reversed during the post-intervention period (RR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.67-0.80, p-value <0.001). The average trend did not differ by case type during early outbreak (p-value>0.05) or post-intervention (p-value>0.05) periods. However, staff had a 70% larger decrease in the average rate of COVID-19 during the post-intervention period compared to residents (RR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.10- 0.88, p-value<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in LTCF. This intervention can be adapted and utilized by other jurisdictions to protect the vulnerable individuals in LTCFs.	false
0	Prevalence of somatic comorbidities among coronavirus disease 2019 patients in Croatia in the first pandemic wave: data from national public health databases. AIM: To determine the prevalence of common somatic comorbidities among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive patients in Croatia in the first pandemic wave, and assess the differences in clinical outcomes depending on the presence of comorbidities., METHODS: We analyzed data from patients confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive from February through May 2020. The data were obtained from clinical laboratories, primary health care providers, and hospitals. Previously recorded comorbidities, including diabetes, cancer, circulatory diseases, chronic pulmonary, and kidney disease, were analyzed., RESULTS: Among 2249 patients, 46.0% were men (median age 51 years; median disease duration 27 days). Hospitalization was required for 41.8% patients, mechanical ventilation for 2.5%, while 4.7% of all patients died. Patients who died were significantly older (median 82 vs 50 years, P<0.001) with a higher prevalence of all investigated comorbidities (all p's <0.001), more frequently required mechanical ventilation (34% vs 1%, P<0.001), and had shorter length of hospital stay (median 13 vs 27 days, P<0.001) with no sex preponderance. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation were significantly older (median age 70 vs 51 years, P<0.001), more frequently men (59.6% vs 45.7%, P=0.037), showed a higher prevalence of all comorbidities except ischemic heart and chronic kidney disease (all p's <0.001), and demonstrated a higher case-fatality rate (63.2% vs 3.2%, P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients who died in the first pandemic wave in Croatia were more likely to suffer previous somatic comorbidities. This corroborates the findings of similar studies and calls for further research into the underlying disease mechanisms, hence providing ground for more efficient preventive measures.	false
0	An overlooked risk for healthcare workers amid COVID-19: Occupational hand eczema. OBJECTIVE: Hand hygiene, one of the most critical preventive methods against Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) cross-transmission, has increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of hand eczema (HE) and associated symptoms in healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 outbreak., METHODS: We distributed a self-administered online survey to physicians and nurses in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The survey included questions about HE-associated symptoms and risk factors before and during the pandemic., RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-four individuals (349 physicians and 215 nurses) answered the survey. Post-COVID-19, the prevalence of HE increased from 6.6% to 11.7% and the prevalence of HE-associated symptoms increased from 39.5% to 79.3%. Female gender (odds ratio [OR]: 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-7.25), a history of atopic diseases (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.03-2.8), more frequent handwashing (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05), and more frequent use of moisturizers (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.24) were independently associated with the risk of HE-associated symptoms., CONCLUSION: Because of increased handwashing during the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a significant increase in HE-associated symptoms in HCWs. Proper education and preventive strategies for HE are urgently needed for HCWs fighting on the front lines of COVID-19.

0	"Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing preferences in a national cohort in the United States. In order to understand preferences about SARS-CoV-2 testing, we conducted a discrete choice experiment among 4793 participants in the Communities, Households, and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING COVID) Cohort Study from July 30-September 8, 2020. We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. ""Comprehensive testers"" (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. ""Fast track testers"" (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. ""Dual testers"" (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. ""Non-invasive dual testers"" (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. ""Home testers"" (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and found that offering additional testing options, which consider this heterogeneity, would likely increase testing uptake., SIGNIFICANCE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic testing has allowed for early detection of cases and implementation of measures to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding individuals' preferences about testing and the service models that deliver tests are relevant in efforts to increase and sustain uptake of SARS-CoV-2 testing, which, despite vaccine availability, will be required for the foreseeable future. We identified substantial differences in preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a discrete choice experiment among a large national cohort of adults in the US. Offering additional testing options that account for or anticipate this heterogeneity in preferences (e.g., both viral and antibody tests, at home testing), would likely increase testing uptake., Classification: Biological Sciences (major); Psychological and Cognitive Sciences (minor)."	false
0	The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Lockdown on the Health and Living Conditions of Undocumented Migrants and Migrants Undergoing Legal Status Regularization. Introduction: Undocumented migrants are at high risk of adverse consequences during crises because of a lack of access to essential securities and sources of support. This study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health and living circumstances of precarious migrants in Switzerland and to assess whether those undergoing legal status regularization fared better than undocumented migrants. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April-May 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. Results: Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. Conclusions: The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.

0	Burton's Agammaglobulinemia and COVID-19. During the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, many patients who have co-morbid conditions are considered high risk for morbidity and mortality; however, those who are immunodeficient are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill. In this article, we present a 26-year old male with a history of X-linked agammaglobulinemia who presented to the hospital with fever and chills after exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 positive individual. The patient had a prolonged course in the hospital, but his symptoms improved quickly after receiving convalescent plasma. This case highlights the clinical course of a patient with severe immunoglobulin deficiency and a possible treatment approach for patients with concomitant agammaglobulinemia and COVID-19.

While studies indicate differences in incidence and case fatality risk of COVID-19, few efforts have shed light on regional variations in the intensity of initial community spread. We conducted a nationwide study using county-level data on COVID-19 from Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We characterized intensity of initial community COVID-19 attack by calculating the incidence and case fatality risk (CFR) for the first 4-week period of COVID-19 spread in each county. We used multivariate multilevel multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association of county-level characteristics with COVID-19 incidence and CFR. Of 3,143 counties, we included 1,052 with at least 100 reported cases on June 1st. Median incidence was 193.4 per 100,000 population (IQR: 94.2-397.5). Median case fatality risk was 3.6% (IQR: 1.4a""7.3). Median age, rural population, population density, lower education, uninsured population, obesity, COPD prevalence were positively associated, while population, female sex, races (Asian, white), higher education, excessive drinking were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 incidence. Median age, female sex, Asian race, population density, higher education, excessive drinking, Intensive Care Unit beds, airborne infection isolation rooms were positively associated, while Hispanic ethnicity, lower education, obesity (paradox), uninsured population were negatively associated with initial COVID-19 CFR."	false

Infection or vaccination induces a population of long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) that are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1-5. Whether this population is induced in patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. Recent reports have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients experience a rapid decay in their antigen-specific serum antibodies, raising concerns that humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived6-8. Here we show that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=73), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies indeed decline rapidly in the first 3 to 4 months after infection. However, this is followed by a more stable phase between 4- and 8-months after infection with a slower serum anti-S antibody decay rate. The level of serum antibodies correlated with the frequency of S-specific long-lived BMPCs obtained from 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparable frequencies of BMPCs specific to contemporary influenza virus antigens or tetanus and diphtheria vaccine antigens were present in aspirates in both groups. Circulating memory B cells (MBCs) directed against the S protein were detected in the SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients but not in uninfected controls, whereas both groups had MBCs against influenza virus hemagglutinin. Overall, we show that robust antigen specific long-lived BMPCs and MBCs are induced after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans.	false
0	"Perceptions and Experiences of the University of Nottingham Pilot SARS-CoV-2 Asymptomatic Testing Service: A Mixed-Methods Study. We aimed to explore student and staff perceptions and experiences of a pilot SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing service (P-ATS) in a UK university campus setting. This was a mixed-method study comprised of an online survey, and thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups conducted at the mid-point and end of the 12-week P-ATS programme. Ninety-nine students (84.8% female, 70% first year; 93.9% P-ATS participants) completed an online survey, 41 individuals attended interviews or focus groups, including 31 students (21 first year; 10 final year) and 10 staff. All types of testing and logistics were highly acceptable (virus: swab, saliva; antibody: finger prick) and 94.9% would participate again. Reported adherence to weekly virus testing was high (92.4% completed >=6 tests; 70.8% submitted all 10 swabs; 89.2% completed >=1 saliva sample) and 76.9% submitted >=3 blood samples. Students tested to ""keep campus safe"", ""contribute to national efforts to control COVID-19"", and ""protect others"". In total, 31.3% had high anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) (27.1% of first year). Students with lower levels of anxiety and greater satisfaction with university communications around P-ATS were more likely to adhere to virus and antibody tests. Increased adherence to testing was associated with higher perceived risk of COVID-19 to self and others. Qualitative findings revealed 5 themes and 13 sub-themes: ""emotional responses to COVID-19"", ""university life during COVID-19"", ""influences on testing participation"", ""testing physical and logistical factors"" and ""testing effects on mental wellbeing"". Asymptomatic COVID-19 testing (SARS-CoV-2 virus/antibodies) is highly acceptable to students and staff in a university campus setting. Clear communications and strategies to reduce anxiety are likely to be important for testing uptake and adherence. Strategies are needed to facilitate social connections and mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and self-isolation."	false
0	Evaluating the effect of nurse-led telephone follow-ups (tele-nursing) on the anxiety levels in people with coronavirus. Background: Nowadays, the prevalence of coronary heart disease has challenged the lives of families around the world. Anxiety is one of the most important consequences of coronavirus. The nurse-led telephone follow-ups (tele-nursing) are a way to train nurses to further improve nursing services and increase the patients' well-being. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nurse-led telephone follow-ups (tele-nursing) on the level of anxiety of people with coronavirus who spend their quarantine and treatment at home., Methods: In this semi-experimental study, the number of sample was 100 newly diagnosed patients with Corona, who were tested positive using the CT scan of the lungs and were selected by continuous sampling. In this study, Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory was used to collect data before and after the intervention. Samples were randomly divided into control and intervention groups (50 subjects in each group) after receiving initial training in the form of lectures on the corona disease, and the tele-nursing program was implemented on the intervention group every other day for 21 consecutive days. Finally, after the end of the 21st day and the completion of the tele-nursing intervention, the questionnaire was again completed by the control and intervention groups and the results of both groups were compared., Results: The results indicated that the level of anxiety in the two groups after the training program and tele-nursing were significantly different (p < 0.001) and the mean score of the anxiety level after the training program and tele-nursing was significantly reduced (p < 0.001)., Conclusion: This study showed that tele-nursing has had a significant effect on reducing the anxiety level of people with Cavid-19 virus. As the telephone technology is available in most clients' homes and its use is easy and accessible, it is recommend including this technology in the field of nursing care and training especially in relation to people with coronavirus.

0	Peripheral Blood Immune Profiling of Convalescent Plasma Donors Reveals Alterations in Specific Immune Subpopulations Even at 2 Months Post SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Immune profiling of patients with COVID-19 has shown that SARS-CoV-2 causes severe lymphocyte deficiencies (e.g., lymphopenia, decreased numbers, and exhaustion of T cells) and increased levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes. Peripheral blood (PB) samples from convalescent plasma (CP) donors, COVID-19 patients, and control subjects were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, allowing the identification of a wide panel of immune cells, comprising lymphocytes (T, B, natural killer (NK) and NKT cells), monocytes, granulocytes, and their subsets. Compared to active COVID-19 patients, our results revealed that the immune profile of recovered donors was restored for most subpopulations. Nevertheless, even 2 months after recovery, CP donors still had reduced levels of CD4+ T and B cells, as well as granulocytes. CP donors with non-detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in their serum were characterized by higher Th9 and Th17 cells, which were possibly expanded at the expense of Th2 humoral immunity. The most noticeable alterations were identified in previously hospitalized CP donors, who presented the lowest levels of CD8+ regulatory T cells, the highest levels of CD56+CD16- NKT cells, and a promotion of a Th17-type phenotype, which might be associated with a prolonged pro-inflammatory response. A longer follow-up of CP donors will eventually reveal the time needed for full recovery of their immune system competence.	false
0	A head-to-head comparison of the intra- and interobserver agreement of COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grading systems in a population with high estimated prevalence of COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the inter- and intraobserver agreement of COVID-RADS and CO-RADS reporting systems among differently experienced radiologists in a population with high estimated prevalence of COVID-19., Methods and materials: Chest CT scans of patients with clinically-epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 were retrieved from an open-source MosMedData data set, randomised, and independently assigned COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades by an abdominal radiology fellow, thoracic imaging fellow and a consultant cardiothoracic radiologist. The inter- and intraobserver agreement of the two systems were assessed using the Fleiss' and Cohen's kappa coefficients, respectively., Results: A total of 200 studies were included in the analysis. Both systems demonstrated moderate interobserver agreement, with kappa values of 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.56] and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.50-0.59) for COVID-RADS and CO-RADS, respectively. When COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades were dichotomised at cut-off values of 2B and 4 to evaluate the agreement between grades representing different levels of clinical suspicion for COVID-19, the interobserver agreement became substantial with kappa values of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82) for COVID-RADS and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65-0.81) for CO-RADS. The median intraobserver agreement was considerably higher for CO-RADS reaching 0.81 (95% CI: 0.43-0.76) compared with 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43-0.76) of COVID-RADS., Conclusions: COVID-RADS and CO-RADS showed comparable interobserver agreement, which was moderate when grades were compared head-to-head and substantial when grades were dichotomised to better reflect the underlying levels of suspicion for COVID-19. The median intraobserver agreement of CO-RADS was, however, considerably higher compared with COVID-RADS., Advances in knowledge: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the newly introduced COVID-19 chest CT reporting systems, which will help radiologists of all sub-specialties and experience levels make an informed decision on which system to use in their own practice.

COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. To launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and to design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory of COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India. We show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with reasonable accuracy. We show that Rt, as the effective reproduction number, exhibits significant spatial variations in these countries. However, by accounting for the spatial variation of Rt in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides estimates of the possible asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 cases, both of which are key contributors in COVID-19 transmission. We have applied our methodology to make detailed predictions for COVID19 incidences at the district and state level in India. Finally, to make the models available to the public at large, we have developed a web-based dashboard, namely ""Predictions and Assessment of Corona Infections and Transmission in India"" (PRACRITI, see http://pracriti.iitd.ac.in), which provides the detailed Rt values and a three-week forecast of COVID cases.

0	Plant Molecular Farming as a Strategy Against COVID-19 - The Italian Perspective. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed more than 37,000 people in Italy and has caused widespread socioeconomic disruption. Urgent measures are needed to contain and control the virus, particularly diagnostic kits for detection and surveillance, therapeutics to reduce mortality among the severely affected, and vaccines to protect the remaining population. Here we discuss the potential role of plant molecular farming in the rapid and scalable supply of protein antigens as reagents and vaccine candidates, antibodies for virus detection and passive immunotherapy, other therapeutic proteins, and virus-like particles as novel vaccine platforms. We calculate the amount of infrastructure and production capacity needed to deal with predictable subsequent waves of COVID-19 in Italy by pooling expertise in plant molecular farming, epidemiology and the Italian health system. We calculate the investment required in molecular farming infrastructure that would enable us to capitalize on this technology, and provide a roadmap for the development of diagnostic reagents and biopharmaceuticals using molecular farming in plants to complement production methods based on the cultivation of microbes and mammalian cells.

0	COVID-19 screening test by using random oropharyngeal saliva. BACKGROUND: An optimal clinical specimen for an accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 by minimizing the usage of consumables and reduce hazard exposure to healthcare workers is a dire priority. The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP+OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed., METHODS: Paired NP+OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 hours of specimen collection from two cohort study which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared., RESULTS: Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP+OP swabs or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP+OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 versus 73.8%; 48/65; p<0.05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP+OP swabs (95.0;99.9 vs 72.2;99.4). The Ct-values of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP+OP swabs specimens., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that random saliva is an alternative diagnostic specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Self-collected random oropharyngeal saliva is a valuable specimen which provides accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing of a community. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Real-world clinical performance of commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in suspected COVID-19: A systematic meta-analysis of available data as per November 20, 2020. <h4>Background</h4> Immunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data. <h4>Methods</h4> We searched the MEDLINE®, Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest)for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients’ symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies’ single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper–Pearson method was applied. <h4>Results</h4> We could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9–100 % and between 50– 100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4– 95.9) and 100% (99.7–100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4–44.3) and 98.3% (91.1–99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold ≤25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Only two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.	false
0	Occurrence of Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the Domestic Cat Population of Germany. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are popular companion animals that live in close contact with their human owners. Therefore, the risk of a trans-species spreading event between domestic cats and humans is ever-present. Shortly after the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid spread around the world, the role of domestic cats in the transmission cycle was questioned. In the present study, the first large-scale survey of antibody occurrence in the domestic cat population in Germany was conducted, in order to assess the incidence of naturally occurring human to cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 920 serum samples, which were collected from April to September of 2020, were screened by an indirect multispecies ELISA. Positive samples were verified using an indirect immunofluorescence test (iIFT) and additionally tested for neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, serum samples were screened for antibodies against feline coronavirus (FCoV), in order to rule out cross-reactivity in the described test systems. Overall, 0.69% (6/920) of serum samples were found to be positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA and iIFT. Two of these reactive sera also displayed neutralizing antibodies. No cross-reactivity with FCoV-specific antibodies was observed. The finding of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive serum samples in the domestic cat population of Germany, during a period when the incidence of human infection in the country was still rather low, indicates that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 happens, but there is no indication of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in cats.	false
0	Antibody responses to endemic coronaviruses modulate COVID-19 convalescent plasma functionality. COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, has been successfully used for treatment of COVID-19. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting therapeutic plasma with desired functionalities.	false
0	Estimation of Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 in India: The Influential Saturated Incidence Rate. A non-linear SEIR mathematical model for coronavirus disease in India has been proposed, by incorporating the saturated incidence rate on the occurrence of new infections. In the model, the threshold quantity known as the reproduction number is evaluated which determines the stability of disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points. The disease-free equilibrium point becomes globally asymptotically stable when the corresponding reproduction number is less than unity, whereas, if it is greater than unity then the endemic equilibrium point comes into existence, which is locally asymptotically stable under certain restrictions on the parameters value in the model. The impact of various parameters on the threshold quantity is signified by the sensitivity analysis. Numerical results imply that by implementing and strictly following the prevention measures a rapid reduction in the reproduction number for COVID-19 can be observed, through which the coronavirus disease can be controlled.	false
0	Conceptualizing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with opioid use disorder: an application of the social ecological model. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled societal disruption with wide ranging effects on individual liberties, the economy, and physical and mental health. While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.	false

Importance: Within the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, more attention is warranted for whether this new infectious disease has unique manifestations in children., Objective: To retrospectively determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 35 children with COVID-19 in Beijing, China., Methods: We collected data for 35 children diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 2020 to June 2020, and analyzed their epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, chest imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes., Results: The children comprised 18 boys (51.4%) and 17 girls (48.6%) aged 6 months to 15 years. All patients had clear epidemiological history, with family clusters accounting for 28 cases (80.0%) and clear tracing of exposure to high epidemic areas in the remaining 7 cases (20.0%). Four (11.4%) patients were classified as asymptomatic, 17 (48.6%) as acute upper respiratory infection, and 14 (40.0%) as mild pneumonia, with no severe or critical cases. Clinical manifestations were mild, including fever in 18 (51.4%), cough in 14 (40.0%), and nausea and diarrhea in 7 (20.0%) patients. White blood cell count was mostly normal (26 cases, 74.3%) or decreased (7 cases, 20.0%); lymphocyte percentage was increased in 24 (68.7%); neutrophil percentage was decreased in 25 (71.4%); alanine aminotransferase was increased in 3 (8.6%); and serum potassium was decreased in 4 (11.4%). Time to negative viral nucleic acid testing was 2-42 days (mean: 14.0 +/- 9.4 days). Chest imaging examination revealed that 20 patients (57.1%) had different forms of lung inflammation. Treatment was mainly isolation and nutritional support. Eleven patients were treated with interferon atomization inhalation. No patients required oxygen therapy. All 35 children were cured and discharged. Length of hospital stay was 9-54 days (mean: 25.4 +/- 13.8 days). During regular follow-up after discharge, 5 children showed positivity again in the viral nucleic acid test and were re-hospitalized for observation and treatment. The mean length of re-hospitalization stay was 10.8 days., Interpretation: Children with COVID-19 mainly become infected within their family, and children of all ages are generally susceptible. The disease in children is mostly mild and the prognosis is good. Nucleic acid tests in some patients become positive again after discharge, suggesting that it is of great significance to carry out centralized isolation medical observations and active nucleic acid tests in close contacts for early detection of patients and routine epidemic prevention and control.

There is already considerable evidence of how this novel corona virus (COVID-19) has had a major impact on our mental health and wellbeing. We are reminded of the mental health consequences of previous infectious disease outbreaks, not only for the public, but for frontline healthcare workers. Yet the lived experiences of resident physicians are missing from this discussion despite them being essential to the COVID-19 response and continuing to provide care during this time. The author asserts that considering what is known about the mental health effects of frontline healthcare work during previous outbreaks, residents are at risk given their role as physicians. In addition to baseline systemic stressors that put residents at risk of mental distress, they also face COVID-19 related stressors that exacerbate the risk given their role as trainees too. The author acknowledges and welcomes several rapid responses to residents' developing mental health needs from medical leaders across Canadian hospitals, programs, and resident bodies. Ultimately, however, medical leaders need to advocate for and implement changes that will support residents' mental health now and in the long-term well after COVID-19 has left its mark.

This paper aims to describe the Italian obstetric surveillance system (ItOSS) preparedness as an element for a timely response to the new Coronavirus pandemic. ItOSS is a surveillance network that has been collecting data on maternal mortality and conducting population studies on obstetric near misses since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, ItOSS launched a new population-based project to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and post-partum and promptly give back information useful to clinicians and decision-makers. All the regions and autonomous provinces, for a total of 289 birth units (PN), joined the study. Data relating to pregnant or post-partum women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis addressing the maternities for outpatient visits or hospitalization were collected. The project methodology entails that each participating maternity reports the cases to ItOSS uploading data through an open-source platform. The on-line form includes sociodemographic and clinical data and maternal-neonatal outcomes. Biological samples to detect possible vertical transmission are also collected voluntarily. A total of 534 incident cases were reported from February 25th to July 10th 2020; 7 regions also collected biological samples for 227 cases; data collection is still ongoing.A preliminary analysis of the first 146 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth between February 25th to April 22nd shows an incidence rate of the infection equal to 2.1/1,000 in Italy and 6.9/1,000 in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). The brief time needed to setting up and operating the project, the national coverage, the adoption of shared tools for data collection, the quality and completeness of the information collected show how the availability of active networks like ItOSS represents a crucial element to hold a high level of preparedness in case of a health emergency.	false

Importance: Violence is a significant public health problem that has become entwined with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., Objective: To describe individuals' concerns regarding violence in the context of the pandemic, experiences of pandemic-related unfair treatment, prevalence of and reasons for firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic., Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used data from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, a probability-based internet survey of California adults conducted from July 14 to 27, 2020. Respondents came from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, an online research panel with members selected using address-based sampling methods. Responses were weighted to be representative of the adult population of California., Main Outcomes and Measures: Topics included worry about violence for oneself before and during the pandemic; concern about violence for someone else due to a pandemic-related loss; experiences of unfair treatment attributed to the pandemic; firearm and ammunition acquisition due to the pandemic; and changes in firearm storage practices due to the pandemic., Results: Of 5018 invited panel members, 2870 completed the survey (completion rate, 57%). Among respondents (52.3% [95% CI, 49.5%-55.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [16.9] years; 41.9% [95% CI, 39.3%-44.6%] White individuals), self-reported worry about violence for oneself was significantly higher during the pandemic for all violence types except mass shootings, ranging from a 2.8 percentage point increase for robbery (from 65.5% [95% CI, 62.8%-68.0%] to 68.2% [95% CI, 65.6%-70.7%]; P = .008) to a 5.6 percentage point increase for stray bullet shootings (from 44.5% [95% CI, 41.7%-47.3%] to 50.0% [47.3%-52.8%]; P < .001). The percentage of respondents concerned that someone they know might intentionally harm themselves was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.5%-15.3%). Of those, 7.5% (95% CI, 4.5%-12.2%) said it was because the other person had experienced a pandemic-related loss. An estimated 110000 individuals (2.4% [95% CI, 1.1%-5.0%] of firearm owners in the state) acquired a firearm due to the pandemic, including 47000 new owners (43.0% [95% CI, 14.8%-76.6%] of those who had acquired a firearm). Of owners who stored at least 1 firearm in the least secure way, 6.7% (95% CI, 2.7%-15.6%) said they had adopted this unsecure storage practice in response to the pandemic., Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of findings from the 2020 California Safety and Well-being Survey, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in self-reported worry about violence for oneself and others, increased firearm acquisition, and changes in firearm storage practices. Given the impulsive nature of many types of violence, short-term crisis interventions may be critical for reducing violence-related harm.	false

This report documents the numbers of air evacuations for diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among U.S. active duty service members (ADSMs) from locations in U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and U.S. European Command (EUCOM) areas of responsibility. Counted were COVID-19 evacuations both within and out of each of the theaters from 11 March through 30 September 2020. Of the 186 evacuations originating in CENTCOM, 185 resulted in the patients arriving at Landstuhl in EUCOM and 1 was within theater. A total of 169 of the CENTCOM evacuations took place in June through August 2020 and only 1 occurred in September. Of the 39 air evacuations originating in EUCOM, 38 were intra-theater transfers and 1 was to a CONUS facility. Most (n=32) of the EUCOM evacuations occurred in September. Evacuees were most often members of the Army (71%), enlisted personnel (63%), males (91%), and aged 30 years or older (58%). Among a random sample of 56 evacuees, 20% were asymptomatic. Among those with symptoms, the most common were cough, fatigue, congestion, headache, and sore throat.	false
0	"Is the ""Common Cold"" Our Greatest Ally in the Battle Against SARS-CoV-2?. The discovery of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in non-infected individuals indicates cross-reactive immune memory from prior exposure to human coronaviruses (HCoV) that cause the common cold. This raises the possibility that ""immunity"" could exist within populations at rates that may be higher than serology studies estimate. Besides specialized research labs, however, there is limited ability to measure HCoV CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which currently impedes interpretation of any potential correlation between COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and the calibration of pandemic control measures. Given this limited testing ability, an alternative approach would be to exploit the large cohort of currently available data from which statistically significant associations may be generated. This would necessitate the merging of several public databases including patient and contact tracing, which could be created by relevant public health organizations. Including data from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in SARS-CoV-2 databases and surveillance systems could provide the necessary information to allow for more informed decisions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 38 million people world-wide by person to person transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therapeutic and preventative strategies for SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant challenge. Within the past several months, effective treatment options have emerged and now include repurposed antivirals, corticosteroids and virus-specific antibodies. The latter has included convalescence plasma and monoclonal antibodies. Complete viral eradication will be achieved through an effective, safe and preventative vaccine. To now provide a comprehensive summary for each of the pharmacotherapeutics and preventative strategies being offered or soon to be developed for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses spread unscrupulously virtually every corner on the planet in a very quick speed leading to an unprecedented world pandemic of COVID-19 claiming a great many of people's life. Paramount importance has been given to the studies on the virus itself including genomic variation and viron structure, as well as cell entry pathway and tissue residence. Other than that, to learn the main characteristic of host immunity responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection is an eminent task for restraining virus and controlling disease progress. Beside antibody production in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, host cellular immunity plays an indispensable role in impeding virus replication and expansion at various stages of COVID-19 disease. In this review, we summarized the recent knowledge regarding the aberrant regulation and dysfunction of multiple immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This includes the dysregulation of immune cell number, Th polarity, cytokine storm they implicated with, as well as cell function exhaustion after chronic virus stimulation. Notwithstanding that many obstacles remain to be overcome, studies on immunotherapy for COVID-19 treatment based on the known features of host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection offer us tangible benefits and hope for making this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic under control.

0	Modelling the transmission of infectious diseases inside hospital bays: implications for COVID-19. Healthcare associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-COVID-19 patients in many hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.	false
0	Current advances in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic that has wreaked havoc globally, which has put a heavy toll on public health, lives, and the world economy. Vaccination is considered as one of the greatest successes in medical history. Based on prior experience with the development of SARS-CoV vaccines, all COVID-19 vaccines must be subjected to the tests for protective effects and harmful risks derived from antibody-dependent enhancement that may contribute to augmented infectivity and/or eosinophilic infiltration. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is now being developed urgently in several different ways. China is regarded as one of the world's leading countries in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, up to date the last inactivated vaccine international clinical (Phase III) trial was launched in the United Arab Emirates by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG). In this review, we outline the current status of vaccine development against clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 strains, anticipating that such attempts would help create efficacious and sage SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

0	Does Diabetes Increase the Risk of Contracting COVID-19? A Population-Based Study in Korea. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the infection risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes (according to treatment method)., METHODS: Claimed subjects to the Korean National Health Insurance claims database diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Ten thousand sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 between January 28 and April 5, 2020, were included. Stratified random sampling of 1:5 was used to select the control group of COVID-19 patients. In total 50,587 subjects were selected as the control group. After deleting the missing values, 60,656 subjects were included., RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio (OR) indicated that diabetic insulin users had a higher risk of COVID-19 than subjects without diabetes (OR, 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.53; P=0.0278). In the subgroup analysis, infection risk was higher among diabetes male insulin users (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89), those between 40 and 59 years (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.44). The infection risk was higher in diabetic insulin users with 2 to 4 years of morbidity (OR, 1.744; 95% CI, 1.003 to 3.044)., CONCLUSION: Some diabetic patients with certain conditions would be associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, highlighting their need for special attention. Efforts are warranted to ensure that diabetic patients have minimal exposure to the virus. It is important to establish proactive care and screening tests for diabetic patients suspected with COVID-19 for timely disease diagnosis and management.	false
0	Considerations for Pooled Testing of Employees for SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: To identify important background information on pooled tested of employees that employers workers, and health authorities should consider., METHODS: This paper is a commentary based on the review by the authors of pertinent literature generally from preprints in medrixiv.org prior to August 2020., RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Pooled testing may be particularly useful to employers in communities with low prevalence of COVID-19. It can be used to reduce the number of tests and associated financial costs. For effective and efficient pooled testing employers should consider it as part of a broader, more comprehensive workplace COVID-19 prevention and control program. Pooled testing of asymptomatic employees can prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and help assure employers and customers that employees are not infectious.

0	Pregnancy Outcomes in COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study in Singapore. INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are reported to be at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to underlying immunosuppression during pregnancy. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and risk of vertical and horizontal transmission remain relatively unknown. We aim to describe and evaluate outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Singapore., METHODS: Prospective observational study of 16 pregnant patients admitted for COVID-19 to 4 tertiary hospitals in Singapore. Outcomes included severe disease, pregnancy loss, and vertical and horizontal transmission., RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 37.5%, 43.8% and 18.7% were infected in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. Two gravidas aged >=35 years (12.5%) developed severe pneumonia; one patient (body mass index 32.9kg/m2) required transfer to intensive care. The median duration of acute infection was 19 days; one patient remained reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive >11 weeks from diagnosis. There were no maternal mortalities. Five pregnancies produced term live-births while 2 spontaneous miscarriages occurred at 11 and 23 weeks. RT-PCR of breast milk and maternal and neonatal samples taken at birth were negative; placenta and cord histology showed non-specific inflammation; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulins were elevated in paired maternal and umbilical cord blood (n=5)., CONCLUSION: The majority of COVID-19 infected pregnant women had mild disease and only 2 women with risk factors (obesity, older age) had severe infection; this represents a slightly higher incidence than observed in age-matched non-pregnant women. Among the women who delivered, there was no definitive evidence of mother-to-child transmission via breast milk or placenta.	false
0	Relative Sensitivity of Saliva and Upper Airway Swabs for Initial Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Ambulatory Patients: Rapid Review. Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Although some studies have suggested a higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods, and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that NP swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is small, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection. Copyright © 2020.

0	Statins as an adjunctive therapy for COVID-19: the biological and clinical plausibility. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected millions of individuals and has claimed hundreds of thousands of human lives worldwide. Patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 patients have high incidence of cardiovascular complications such as acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, and thromboembolism. The disease has no approved proven effective therapy and hence repurposing of existing approved drugs has been considered as the fastest treatment approach. Statins have been shown to exhibit lipid lowering dependent and independent cardiovascular protective effects as well as favorable effects in various other pathophysiological states. These beneficial properties of statins are a result of their multiple pleotropic effects that include, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms of the pleotropic effects of statins, the relevant pre-clinical and clinical data pertinent to their role in infections and acute lung injury, the possible cardiovascular benefits of statins in COVID-19, and the implications of the therapeutic potential of statins in COVID-19 disease. We conclude with the rationale for conducting randomized controlled trials of statins in COVID-19 disease.	false

0	Risk of depression, suicide and psychosis with hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational network cohort study. OBJECTIVES: Concern has been raised in the rheumatology community regarding recent regulatory warnings that HCQ used in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic could cause acute psychiatric events. We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation or psychosis associated with HCQ as used for RA., METHODS: We performed a new-user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and USA). RA patients >=18 years of age and initiating HCQ were compared with those initiating SSZ (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30 days) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HRs), with estimates pooled where I2 <40%., RESULTS: A total of 918 144 and 290 383 users of HCQ and SSZ, respectively, were included. No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term HCQ (compared with SSZ) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 (95% CI 0.79, 1.16) for depression, 0.94 (95% CI 0.49, 1.77) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 1.03 (95% CI 0.66, 1.60) for psychosis. No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.26) for depression, 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.07) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72, 1.35) for psychosis., CONCLUSION: HCQ as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation or psychosis compared with SSZ. No effects were seen in the short or long term. Use at a higher dose or for different indications needs further investigation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered with EU PAS (reference no.

0	Immediate psychological responses during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi medical students. Background: The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue., Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students., Method: A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software., Result: The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students' present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety., Conclusion: A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. Poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students' mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.

0	Asthma and COVID-19: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia. As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unproven., METHODS: Here, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID-19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progression., RESULTS: We found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2623 patients accounting for 1.6% of all patients., CONCLUSIONS: As the global prevalence of asthma is 4.4%, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID-19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID-19 patients.	false
0	"Coronavirus disease (COVID 2019): protocol for a living overview of systematic reviews. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow worldwide, and systematic reviews (SRs)/meta-analyses (MAs) on COVID-19 can efficiently guide evidence-based clinical practice. However, SRs/MAs with weaknesses can mislead clinical practice and pose harm to patients, and too many useless SRs/MAs could pose confusion and waste sources. A ""living"" overview of SRs/MAs aims to provide an open, accessible and frequently updated resource summarizing the highest-level evidence of COVID-19, that can help evidence-users to quickly identify trusted evidence to guide the practice. This study aims to systematically give an overview SRs/MAs of COVID-19, assess their quality, and identify the best synthesis of evidence., METHODS: Databases including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM) and WanFang were systematically searched on May 1, 2020 using relevant terms for identify SRs/MAs related to COVID-19. The study selection, data extraction and quality assessment will be performed by independent reviewers, and results will be crosschecked.

0	INFERRING KEY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF COVID-19 BASED ON A MODIFIED SEIR MODEL. This study aims to establish a model-based framework for inferring key transmission characteristics of the newly emerging outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially the epidemic dynamics under quarantine conditions. Inspired by the shifting therapeutic levels and capacity at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a modified SEIR model with a two-phase removal rate of quarantined hosts undergoing continuously tunable transition. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for inferring and forecasting the epidemiological dynamics from the publicly available surveillance reports. The effectiveness of a short-term prediction is illustrated by adopting the data sets from 10 demographic regions including Chinese mainland and South Korea. In the surveillance period, the average R-0 ranges from 1.74 to 3.28, and the median of the mean latent period does not exceed 10 days across the surveillance regions.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection: General characteristics and specific in dental practice. The transmission of the coronavirus and possible routes of infection are still unclear. The most common routes of infection in humans are direct transmission through respiratory droplets and saliva when coughing or sneezing and indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces. Most of the infected people after the incubation period have clinical manifestations with mild or moderate respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Physician of dental medicine performs aerosol procedures which transmit the virus directly from healthy people. Oral fluids, blood, conjunctiva, nasal, and oral mucosa are also a source of infection, so they are highly exposed to the virus, much more than other medical staff and therefore it is crucial to establish appropriate protocols and prevention strategies. Under conditions of a declared global pandemic, dentists are advised to stop their work of all cases that are not urgent. If the dental office is one of those that provide the necessary and urgent medical attention, it is necessary to strictly implement control measures to prevent infection. The basic protocols for the operation of the dental offices have been published by the Dental Chamber of Macedonia and they are recommendations regarding the procedures for the maintenance of the hygiene of the medical staff and the working space. Recent experience has shown that dental health-care services are often neglected and inadequately treated in epidemics. Dental workers are particularly exposed to RTIs due to their specific field and mode of operation, so the current experience will prepare them for future challenges.Copyright © 2020 Aneta Mijoska, Marijan Denkovski, Efka Zabokova-Bilbilovska.	false
0	First experience in management of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in kidney transplant patient - case report. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged in the world. There are limited data describing the clinical progression of COVID-19 in transplanted patients. In the general population, clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and may also develop renal failure. In kidney transplant (KT) patients, management of these patients was mainly based on anecdotal experience. CASE REPORT: We report our first experience of KT patients with COVID-19. A 49-year-old male with KT in 2017 presented on March 20, 2020, with fever, weakness, smell loss, chest pain, and caught. On chest X-ray, he presented ground-glass opacities and bilateral pneumonia. There was a slight progression to acute hypoxic respiratory failure. We reduced immunosuppression therapy and since we suspected seasonal flu, we applied available antiviral oseltamivir till confirmation of RNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, we applied azithromycin and broad spectrum of antibiotics as well as an anticoagulant therapy. Graft function remained stable during 14 days of hospitalization. The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and manifested clinical recovery. After two negative PCR test, he was discharged and immunosuppression therapy was returned to previous. CONCLUSION(S): This case highlights the importance of earlier outpatient hospitalization and testing which may improve COVID-19 outcomes among transplanted patients.Copyright © 2020 Galina Severova, Igor Nikolov, Lada Trajceska, Nikola Gjorgjievski, Fadil Cana, Ilir Demiri, Milena Stevanovik, Irena Rambabova-Bushljetik, Goce Spasovski.	false

0	Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Patients with Severe Pneumonia in Khuzestan Province, Iran. The emergence of a highly pathogenic virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) accounts for severe pneumonia throughout the world. More than 7 million world population have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the number of deaths is increasing every day. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infection (ART). During an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 909 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, including 517 (56.9%) males and 392 (43.1%) females. All the collected samples were from different cities of Khuzestan province from 19 February to- 27 March 2020. The RNA was extracted from samples and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Simultaneously, the computerized tomography (CT) scan was tested for the presence of ground-glass opacity in the lung among the patients. Of the total number of 909 specimens, 328 (36.08%) cases, including 185 (20.35%) females and 143 (15.73%) males, were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 while, 581 (63.9%) cases, including 374 (41.14%) males and 207 (22.77%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (p= 0.001).Four hundred sixteen (45.76%) cases were positive for ground-glass opacity in the lung by CT scan, while 328/909 (36.08%) trials proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time PCR (p=0.003). In this study, 36.08% of patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the results of positive cases by CT scan showed higher than real-time PCR, screening the SARS-CoV-2 with a real-time PCR method is the first line of choice.	false
0	Postpartum mood among universally screened high and low socioeconomic status patients during COVID-19 social restrictions in New York City. The mental health effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on postpartum women are of increasing concern among mental health practitioners. To date, only a handful of studies have explored the emotional impact of the pandemic surrounding pregnancy and none have investigated the consequence of pandemic-related social restrictions on the postpartum mood of those living among different socioeconomic status (SES). All postpartum patients appearing to the Mount Sinai Health System for their postpartum appointment between January 2, 2020 and June 30, 2020, corresponding to before and during pandemic imposed social restrictions, were screened for mood symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each patient's socioeconomic status (high/low) was determined by their location of clinical service. A total of 516 postpartum patients were screened. While no differences in EPDS scores were observed by SES prior to social restrictions (U = 7956.0, z = - 1.05, p = .293), a significant change in mood symptomatology was observed following COVID-19 restrictions (U = 4895.0, z = - 3.48, p < .001), with patients living in lower SES reporting significantly less depression symptomatology (U = 9209.0, z = - 4.56, p < .001). There was no change in symptomatology among patients of higher SES (U = 4045.5, z = - 1.06, p = .288). Postpartum depression, the most common complication of childbearing, is a prevalent, cross-cultural disorder with significant morbidity. The observed differences in postpartum mood between patients of different SES in the context of temporarily imposed COVID-19-related social restrictions present a unique opportunity to better understand the specific health and social support needs of postpartum patients living in urban economic poverty. Given that maternal mental illness has negative long-term developmental implications for the offspring and that poor mental health reinforces the poverty cycle, future health policy specifically directed towards supporting postpartum women living in low SES by ameliorating some of the early maternal burdens associated with balancing employment-family-childcare demands may assist in interrupting this cycle while simultaneously improving the long-term outcomes of their offspring.	false
0	Effect of Sex on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Coronavirus Disease: A Population-Based Study. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using a population-based dataset., METHODS: In this retrospective study, insurance claims data from the Korea database were used. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were included in the study. All diseases were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision. During follow-up, the clinical outcomes, except mortality, were assessed using the electrical codes from the dataset. The clinical outcomes noted were: hospitalization, the use of inotropics, high flow nasal cannula, conventional oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, development of acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation after the diagnosis of COVID-19., RESULTS: A total of 7327 patients were included; of these, 2964 patients (40.5%) were men and 4363 patients (59.5%) were women. There were no significant differences in the Charlson comorbidity index score between men and women in the same age group. The incidence of mortality and clinical outcomes was higher among men than among women. The mortality rate was the highest for the populations aged 50-64 or >=65 years. The subgroup analyses for age, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension showed favorable results for patient survival or clinical outcomes for women compared to men., CONCLUSION: Our population-based study showed that female patients with COVID-19 were associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, the impact of sex was more evident in patients aged 50-64 or >=65 years.	false
0	"Prevalence and Related Factors of Insomnia Among Chinese Medical Staff in the Middle and Late Stage of COVID-19. Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has brought serious psychological pressure to people, especially medical health staff. At present, there are few studies on insomnia and related factors of medical health staff in the middle and late stage of the epidemic of COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and its related risk factors among medical workers in China in the middle and later stage of COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the relationship between insomnia and psychological resilience. Methods: From February 14 to March 29, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 606 medical staff in China through Ranxing Technology's ""SurveyStar"" network platform. All subjects were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and simplified Chinese version of Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC-10). Results: In the middle and later stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of insomnia among medical staff was 32.0%. Compared with non-insomnia group, the insomnia group had younger age, lower education level, longer daily working hours and less psychological resilience. In addition, the prevalence of insomnia was higher in medical staff with a history of somatic diseases. The severity of insomnia of Chinese medical staff was associated with age, education level, daily working hours, psychological resilience and somatic diseases. Conclusions: Our study shows that nearly 1/3 of Chinese medical workers suffer from insomnia nearly a month after the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared with the general population, medical staff who are working with COVID are more prone to insomnia. Risk factors for insomnia include younger age, lower education level, longer working hours per day, and physical illness. The tenacious dimension of psychological resilience is a protective factor for insomnia. Copyright © 2020 Liu, Liu, Zhu, Li, Huang, Deng, Guo, Huang, Liao, Mao, Miao, Liu, Xiu and Zhang."	false

OBJECTIVES: To compile current published reports on nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evaluate the role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in transmission, and evaluate outbreak management practices., METHODS: Narrative literature review., SHORT CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a large burden on hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide, which increases the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks to ""non-COVID"" patients or residents, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, as well as HCWs. To date, there are several reports on nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, and although the attack rate is variable, it can be as high as 60%, with high mortality. There is currently little evidence on transmission dynamics, particularly using genomic sequencing, and the role of HCWs in initiating or amplifying nosocomial outbreaks is not elucidated. There has been a paradigm shift in management practices of viral respiratory outbreaks, that includes widespread testing of patients (or residents) and HCWs, including asymptomatic individuals. These expanded testing criteria appear to be crucial in identifying and controlling outbreaks."	false
0	[Dental care during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic]. We analyze the transmission routes, possible viral reservoirs in the oral cavity and considerations about dental care of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. We also analyze the protocols required before and after a dental procedure, aiming to increase the awareness of dentists about the importance of virus spread prevention among health care workers and patients. The evaluation of symptoms associated with SARS- CoV-2 such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and the inquiry about possible contacts with infected people is of utmost importance. The tongue and oral mucosa are important viral reservoirs and the transmission of the virus occurs primarily by saliva droplets. Therefore, elective dental care should be postponed, attending only dental emergencies during this period, incorporating the use of protective personal equipment (PPE) and using manual instruments to prevent the production of aerosols.	false
0	Evaluating ELISA, Immunofluorescence, and Lateral Flow Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays. Background: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has emerged at the end of 2019. Aside from the detection of viral genome with specific RT-PCR, there is a growing need for reliable determination of the serological status. We aimed at evaluating five SARS-CoV-2 serology assays., Methods: An in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA), two ELISA kits (EUROIMMUN R ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NovaLisa R SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM) and two lateral flow assays (T-Tek R SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibody Test Kit and Sure Bio-tech R SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test) were compared on 40 serums from RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 10 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects as controls., Results: Control subjects tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with all five systems. Estimated sensitivities varied from 35.5 to 71.0% for IgG detection and from 19.4 to 64.5% for IgM detection. For IgG, in-house IFA, EuroImmun, T-Tek and NovaLisa displayed 50-72.5% agreement with other systems except IFA vs EuroImmun and T-Tek vs NovaLisa. Intermethod agreement for IgM determination was between 30 and 72.5%., Discussion: The overall intermethod agreement was moderate. This inconsistency could be explained by the diversity of assay methods, antigens used and immunoglobulin isotype tested. Estimated sensitivities were low, highlighting the limited value of antibody detection in CoVID-19., Conclusion: Comparison of five systems for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies showed limited sensitivity and overall concordance. The place and indications of serological status assessment with currently available tools in the CoVID-19 pandemic need further evaluations.

0	Spike protein D614G and RdRp P323L: the SARS-CoV-2 mutations associated with severity of COVID-19. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), greatly varies from patient to patient. In the present study, we explored and compared mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from mildly affected and severely affected COVID-19 patients in order to explore any relationship between mutation profile and disease severity. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. With the help of Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool, genomic sequences were aligned with the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus reference sequence and all the mutations were identified. Distribution of mutant variants was then compared between mildly and severely affected groups. Among the numerous mutations detected, 14,408C>T and 23,403A>G mutations resulting in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P323L and spike protein D614G mutations, respectively, were found predominantly in severely affected group (>82%) compared with mildly affected group (<46%, p < 0.001). The 241C>T mutation in the non-coding region of the genome was also found predominantly in severely affected group (p < 0.001). The 3,037C>T, a silent mutation, also appeared in relatively high frequency in severely affected group compared with mildly affected group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). We concluded that spike protein D614G and RdRp P323L mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are associated with severity of COVID-19. Further studies will be required to explore whether these mutations have any impact on the severity of disease.	false
0	"A direct RT-qPCR approach to test large numbers of individuals for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity and mortality in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, particularly in retirement homes, where transmission from asymptomatic staff and visitors may introduce the infection. Here we present a cheap and fast screening method based on direct RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in single or pooled gargle lavages (""mouthwashes""). This method detects individuals with large viral loads (Ct<=29) and we use it to test all staff at a nursing home daily over a period of three weeks in order to reduce the risk that the infection penetrates the facility. This or similar approaches can be implemented to protect hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions in this and future viral epidemics."	false
0	Development, evaluation, and validation of machine learning models for covid-19 detection based on complete blood count test from 1,624 patients. The amplification of viral RNA by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test is the current gold standard for the confirmation of an infection from coronavirus (COVID-19), the worldwide pandemic that, in the first eight months post-outbreak, has caused almost 730.000 deaths. However, this test presents known limits, such as a long turnaround time, false-negative rates as high as 15-20%, expensive equipment, and a lack of trained personnel. Thus, there is a need for alternative, faster, cheaper, and more accessible tests. We developed a number of machine learning (ML) classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines) based on the routine complete blood count (CBC) data, from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive) on admission to the Emergency Department (ED) at the San Raffaele Hospital (OSR) from February 19, to May 31, 2020. This dataset is composed by 21 features including age, gender, suffering from COVID specific symptoms at triage, COVID-19 positivity, and CBC data. The ML models were trained using a training set comprising 80% of the cases (after model selection and hyperparameter optimization) and were evaluated on a test set comprising the remaining cases (20% of the cases). An external dataset (from 58 patients admitted at the ED of the Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi of Milan, March 5-May 26, 2020) and an internal dataset (data from 54 patients randomly chosen admitted in OSR in 2018), were used for the validation. All models showed a reported accuracy that is consistently higher than 85%. They achieved good performances in symptomatic patients (with both the sensitivity and specificity at approximately 80%) and performed even better in terms of specificity in asymptomatic patients (100% specificity), although the sensitivity was as low as 50%. Our study demonstrates that ML can be applied to CBC as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an extraordinary increase in contagions, as they can suffer from shortages of rRTPCR reagents and specialized laboratories.	false

0	ANTI-A AND SARS-COV-2: AN INTRIGUING ASSOCIATION. Introduction: It is not clear which individual characteristics can determine susceptibility and intensity of symptoms, however, age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension and some haematological biomarkers, as D-dimer, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were associated with a worse outcome. Recently, it has been hypothesized that ABO blood groups can be related to susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering that the first studies reported A group as a risk factor and O group as a protection, some authors have been suggested that the anti-A antibodies, and not the blood group, could be responsible for the findings. Objective(s): Based on these findings, this study analysed the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the presence (O and B blood groups type) or absence (A and AB blood groups type) of anti-A antibodies, considering the production of specific immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM and IgG) and neutralizing antibodies. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study with 430 COVID-19 individuals (268 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors-CCPD and 162 COVID-19 inpatients-CIP) from two Brazilian reference hospitals, confirmed by RT-PCR, and 2,212 healthy volunteer blood donors (VBD) as control group, that were evaluated and divided into two groups: with anti-A (O/B blood groups) and without anti-A group (A/AB blood groups). Immunoglobulins and neutralizing antibody titres were measured for CCPD and CID. Multivariate logistic regression and non-parametric tests were performed. Result(s): Although O blood group was the most frequent ABO group among VBD, A blood group was more frequent among COVID-19 individuals (CCPD 47.8%, CIP 43.2%, VBD 35.5%, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in blood groups distribution between CCPD and CIP (p=0.268). In our cohort, for each increased age year there was 6% more chance for COVID-19 (OR: 1.06; CI 95%: 1.05-1.06, p < 0.001), males showed 27% more chance for the disease (OR: 1.27; CI 95%: 1.02-1.59, p = 0.035) and O/B blood groups showed 38% less infection prevalence (OR: 0.62; CI 95%: 0.5-0.7, p < 0.001). Considering the fact that higher anti-A is usually described in O blood group, data from O versus B blood groups individuals were analysed and the former showed 34% less chance for COVID-19 (OR: 0.66; CI 95%: 0.46-0.95, p = 0.026). No difference regarding ABO group was found when COVID-19 inpatients of all blood types were analysed. Immunoglobulins A, M and G (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were lower in COVID-19 individuals O/B blood groups (IgM p = 0.03, IgG p = 0.02, IgA p = 0.03). Discution: In our retrospective cohort, the COVID-19 individuals O/B blood groups (which produces anti-A) had 38% less chance to have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and the same groups showed lower titers of neutralizing antibodies, IgM, IgG and IgA. Groups O/B showed a protective factor against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it was not associated to COVID-19 inpatients (versus COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors) suggesting that blood type is not associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection severity. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 individuals from groups O/B showed lower titers of neutralizing antibodies, and IgM, IgG, and IgA lower levels.Copyright © 2020	false
0	"Overview of pathology and laboratory features of covid-19. BACKGROUND: The third identified severe respiratory disease in the past two decades and the first to result in a pandemic is the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) specifically caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). AIM: The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the basic pathology and diagnostic laboratory features of COVID-19. METHOD(S): This review involved search of literatures on PubMed, Science alert, Medline, and Advanced Google search using the keywords ""SARS-CoV2,"" ""Coronavirus"" along with ""pathology of COVID-19"" and ""diagnosis of COVID-19"" with related articles pooled, relevant information extracted, and properly referenced. RESULT(S): The recommended method of diagnosis is by nucleic acid testing of the viral ribonucleic acid in which real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by nucleic acid sequencing when required is performed while some serologic techniques developed include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunochromatographic lateral flow assay, neutralization bioassay, and specific chemosensors to detect the immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies produced, although sole use of serologic tests is highly discouraged by monitoring agencies. The hematological features display leukocytosis with lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, reduced procalcitonin along with increased D-dimer, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, fibrin, fibrin degradation products, and some inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, MCP10, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The pathologic presentations include pleurisy, lung consolidation, pulmonary edema and pericarditis along with other features of acute respiratory syndrome, myocardial injury, and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSION(S): There are highly efficacious and reliable methods of diagnosis of COVID-19 which also determine the stage and severity of the condition, and these methods are performed in line with specific clinical presentations. However, more studies are required to identify the capabilities, characteristics, and tendencies of this novel virus.Copyright © 2020 Oluwaseyi Eunice Bamisaye, Funmilayo Ajoke Adewumi, Ayodeji Blessing Ajileye."	false
0	Diabetes in COVID-19: Prevalence, practical considerations. Background and aims: High prevalence of diabetes makes it an important comorbidity in patients with COVID-19. We sought to review and analyze the data regarding the association between diabetes and COVID-19, pathophysiology of the disease in diabetes and management of patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 infection. Methods: PubMed database and Google Scholar were searched using the key terms 'COVID-19', 'SARSCoV-2', 'diabetes', 'antidiabetic therapy' up to April 2, 2020. Full texts of the retrieved articles were accessed. Results: There is evidence of increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. COVID-19 could have effect on the pathophysiology of diabetes. Blood glucose control is important not only for patients who are infected with COVID-19, but also for those without the disease.

0	Delirium in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multicenter Study. Objectives: The aims of this study are to report the prevalence of delirium on admission to the unit in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to identify the factors associated with delirium, and to evaluate the association between delirium and in-hospital mortality. Design(s): Multicenter observational cohort study. Setting(s): Acute medical units in four Italian hospitals. Participant(s): A total of 516 patients (median age 78 years) admitted to the participating centers with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 22 to May 17, 2020. Measurements: Comprehensive medical assessment with detailed history, physical examinations, functional status, laboratory and imaging procedures. On admission, delirium was determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) criteria, 4AT, m-Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, or clinical impression depending on the site. The primary outcomes were delirium rates and in-hospital mortality. Result(s): Overall, 73 (14.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.0-17.3%) patients presented delirium on admission. Factors significantly associated with delirium were dementia (odds ratio, OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 2.03-10.69), the number of chronic diseases (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03; 1.40), and chest X-ray or CT opacity (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.12-9.64 and 3.35, 95% CI = 1.07-10.47, for multiple or bilateral opacities and single opacity vs no opacity, respectively). There were 148 (33.4%) in-hospital deaths in the no-delirium group and 43 (58.9%) in the delirium group (P-value assessed using the Gray test <.001). As assessed by a multivariable Cox model, patients with delirium on admission showed an almost twofold increased hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality with respect to patients without delirium (hazard ratio = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.25-2.83). Conclusion(s): Delirium is prevalent and associated with in-hospital mortality among older patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The American Geriatrics Society	false
0	Convergence of COVID-19 and chronic air pollution risks: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in the U.S. Recent research suggests greater COVID-19 prevalence in areas burdened with higher exposure to chronic air pollution, but previous studies have not examined if socially disadvantaged populations are more likely to reside in communities located at the convergence of both COVID-19 and air pollution health risks. This article presents a national scale U.S. study that investigates whether racial/ethnic minorities, socioeconomically deprived residents, and other vulnerable groups are significantly overrepresented in counties where significantly higher COVID-19 incidence spatially coincides with higher respiratory health risks from outdoor exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). COVID-19 data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database are linked to respiratory risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment and variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Bivariate local measures of spatial association are implemented to identify county clusters representing relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and respiratory risk from HAP exposure. Socio-demographic characteristics of these clusters are compared using bivariate statistical tests and multivariable generalized estimating equations. Counties where greater COVID-19 incidence coincides significantly with higher HAP respiratory risk contain disproportionately higher percentages of non-Hispanic Black, socioeconomically deprived, and uninsured residents than all other U.S. counties, after controlling for spatial clustering, population density, older age, and other contextual factors. These significant socio-demographic inequities represent an important starting point for more detailed investigations of places facing the double burden of elevated COVID-19 prevalence and air pollution exposure, and also emphasize the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for addressing both COVID-19 and chronic air pollution in socially vulnerable communities.

0	A rare case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced Hartnup disease. INTRODUCTION: Niacin Deficiency is an uncommon finding in developed countries and is usually secondary to poor dietary intake. A rare cause is Hartnup Disease, which leads to malabsorption of amino acids, specifically tryptophan. Patients may present with Pellagra, a constellation of symptoms that include dermatitis, diarrhea, and neurological abnormalities. We present a case of a patient infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented with Pellagra and Niacin deficiency secondary to undiagnosed Hartnup disease. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 46-year-old male without significant medical history presented with complaints of fever, polydipsia, polyuria, non-bloody diarrhea and dyspnea. Labs revealed a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. During his hospital course, the patient developed confusion, disorientation and required supplemental oxygen. His polydipsia and polyuria worsened and his diarrhea was persistent. His physical exam revealed a pigmented rash that was diffuse on bilateral lower and upper extremities. Niacin deficiency was suspected to be the etiology of his symptoms. A urine chromatography was obtained (Figure 1), which was consistent with Hartnup disease. Niacin supplementation was administered with subsequent resolution of the patient's symptoms. He was discharged home with instructions to continue to take multivitamins. DISCUSSION: Our case describes a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, which may have led to amino acid deficiencies inducing pellagra in a previously asymptomatic patient with Hartnup disease. It has previously been reported that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) downregulates ACE2 expression in the GI tract. This leads to impaired amino acid absorption, specifically tryptophan. We hypothesize that similar to its previous generation, the novel SAR-CoV-2 may also downregulate ACE2 expression in the GI tract leading to malabsorption and a deficiency of amino acids. We suggest that it was by this mechanism that the patient's infection precipitated symptoms of niacin deficiency in the setting of underlying Hartnup disease. This case serves to raise awareness that SARS-CoV-2 may be altering reabsorption of nutrients in the GI tract and leading to the development of new nutritional deficiencies or exacerbating previously undiagnosed inborn errors of intestinal nutrient absorption.	false

INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 6 million people globally and resulted in over 350,000 deaths thus far. While primarily a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations have been described in up to 50.5% of patients. In a subgroup of patients, GI symptoms may be the only evidence of infection. Understanding the full spectrum of GI manifestations is crucial for recognizing affected patients and maintaining the safety of both clinicians and the public. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 27-year-old woman with lupus presented to the emergency room with three days of abdominal pain and three weeks of cough, fevers, and malaise. Physical examination was notable for severe pain with epigastric palpation but without rebound or guarding. An abdominal CT revealed segments of small bowel wall thickening concerning for possible ischemia. An abdominal angiogram showed no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, however, exhibited small bowel inflammation. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy found atrophic, friable esophagus and circumferential ulceration of the distal duodenum. Biopsies revealed fibrin-rich thrombi within the lamina propria, and submucosa associated with mucosal necrosis. No cellular infiltration was observed to suggest vasculitis. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR from admission returned positive. Rheumatology was consulted and determined that the patient's lupus was not clinically active and that microthrombi were likely related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was discharged home on pantoprazole and apixaban with GI follow-up and instructions to self-isolate. DISCUSSION: This is the first case to date describing ulceration of the GI tract in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathology suggests the mechanism of injury to be microthrombi causing mucosal necrosis. Autopsies of recently deceased patients have similarly revealed microthrombi affecting the pulmonary and renal vasculature and it is hypothesized to be the mechanism of organ damage. Optimal medical management for hypercoagulability in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Some authors recommend anticoagulation for 3-6 months only if venous thromboembolism (VTE) is present, while others endorse a prophylactic strategy by discharging all patients on 4-6 weeks of treatment. As SARS-CoV-2 becomes increasingly prevalent, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with new onset ulcerative esophagitis or duodenitis.

0	Impact of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection in children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. Background: Cases of refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia have been increasing recently; however, whether viral coinfection or macrolide-resistant M. infection contribute to the development of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. Method(s): Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. Result(s): Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679-0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310-9.353, P = 0.012). Conclusion(s): The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

For over 6 months of its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has resulted to unprecedented global health challenge and economic uncertainties. The pandemic swiftly disseminated to almost all the countries and territories of the world. The index case in Nigeria was imported by an Italian citizen on February 27, 2020. Typical of a novel respiratory tract viral infection, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria was slow in the first few days. However, as at 8:00 AM GMT+1, July 1, 2020, there were 25694 confirmed COVID-19 cases. With the continuous daily rise in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, enhanced surveillance programs were immediately activated and implemented in all parts of Nigeria. Even though an inadequate number of persons have been tested so far, the government of Nigeria has been activating public health laboratories to scale up its testing capacity. Due to the impact of partial lockdown and curfew in most states of Nigeria, the government has been able to provide some form of palliatives to vulnerable populations. This study aims to review and present the various public health and socioeconomic responses and challenges of the COVID19 pandemic in Nigeria. This reflects the efforts and successful steps taken to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria.Copyright © 2020 Idris Nasir Abdullahi, Anthony Uchenna Emeribe, Peter Elisha Ghamba, Musa Sani.	false

0	Evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in children with SARS-CoV-2 across the spectrum of clinical presentations. Most children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have mild or minimal disease, with a small proportion developing severe disease or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population. We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients. We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18). As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001). Higher sC5b9 levels were associated with higher serum creatinine (P = .01) but not age. Of the 19 patients for whom complete clinical criteria were available, 17 (89%) met criteria for TMA. A high proportion of tested children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had evidence of complement activation and met clinical and diagnostic criteria for TMA. Future studies are needed to determine if hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for TMA, if TMA-directed management is helpful, and if there are any short- or long-term clinical consequences of complement activation and endothelial damage in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C.

Objectives: Primary objectives center dot To assess the time from randomisation until an improvement within 84 days defined as two points on a seven point ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission by infusion of plasma from subjects after convalescence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or standard of care. Secondary objectives center dot To assess overall survival, and the overall survival rate at 28 56 and 84 days. center dot To assess SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. center dot To assess the percentage of patients that required mechanical ventilation. center dot To assess time from randomisation until discharge. Trial design: Randomised, open-label, multicenter phase II trial, designed to assess the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 disease in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) following treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma or standard of care. Participants: High-risk patients >18 years of age hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 10-15 university medical centres will be included. High-risk is defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive infection with Oxygen saturation at <= 94% at ambient air with additional risk features as categorised in 4 groups: center dot Group 1, pre-existing or concurrent hematological malignancy and/or active cancer therapy (incl. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) within the last 24 months or less. center dot Group 2, chronic immunosuppression not meeting the criteria of group 1. center dot Group 3, age >= 50 - 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2 and at least one of these criteria: Lymphopenia < 0.8 x G/l and/or D-dimer > 1 mu g/mL. center dot Group 4, age >= 75 years meeting neither the criteria of group 1 nor group 2. Observation time for all patients is expected to be at least 3 months after entry into the study. Patients receive convalescent plasma for two days (day 1 and day 2) or standard of care. For patients in the standard arm, cross over is allowed from day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. Nose/throat swabs for determination of viral load are collected at day 0 and day 1 (before first CP administration) and subsequently at day 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 28 or until discharge. Serum for SARS-Cov-2 diagnostic is collected at baseline and subsequently at day 3, 7, 14 and once during the follow-up period (between day 35 and day 84). There is a regularfollow-upof 3 months. All discharged patients are followed by regular phone calls. All visits, time points and study assessments are summarized in the Trial Schedule (see full protocol Table1). All participating trial sites will be supplied with study specific visit worksheets that list all assessments and procedures to be completed at each visit. All findings including clinical and laboratory data are documented by the investigator or an authorized member of the study team in the patient's medical record and in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Intervention and comparator: This trial will analyze the effects of convalescent plasma from recovered subjects with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients at high risk for a poor outcome due to underlying disease, age or condition as listed above are eligible for enrollment. In addition, eligible patients have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and O-2 saturation <= 94% while breathing ambient air. Patients are randomised to receive (experimental arm) or not receive (standard arm) convalescent plasma in two bags (238 - 337 ml plasma each) from different donors (day 1, day 2). A cross over from the standard arm into the experimental arm is possible after day 10 in case of not improving or worsening clinical condition. Main outcomes Primary endpoints: The main purpose of the study is to assess the time from randomisation until an improvement within 84 days defined as two points on a seven-point ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital in high-risk patients (group 1 to group 4) with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission by infusion of plasma from subjects after convalescence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or standard of care. Secondary endpoints: center dot Overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause 28-day, 56-day and 84-day overall survival rates. center dot SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and load as well as antibody titres. center dot Requirement mechanical ventilation at any time during hospital stay (yes/no). center dot Time until discharge from randomisation. center dot Viral load, changes in antibody titers and cytokine profiles are analysed in an exploratory manner using paired non-parametric tests (before - after treatment). Randomisation: Upon confirmation of eligibility (patients must meet all inclusion criteria and must not meet exclusion criteria described in section 5.3 and 5.4 of the full protocol), the clinical site must contact a centralized internet randomization system (https://randomizer.at/). Patients are randomized using block randomisation to one of the two arms, experimental arm or standard arm, in a 1:1 ratio considering a stratification according to the 4 risk groups (see Participants). Blinding (masking): The study is open-label, no blinding will be performed. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): A total number of 174 patients is required for the entire trial, n=87 per group. Trial Status: Protocol version 1.2 dated 09/07/2020. A recruitment period of approximately 9 months and an overall study duration of approximately 12 months is anticipated. Recruitment of patients starts in the third quarter of 2020. The study duration of an individual patient is planned to be 3 months.

0	COVID-19 and cholestasis: Potential role of interleukin-6. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with over 1 million cases in the United States. Pulmonary symptoms are the most common; however, the liver is one of the involved organs. Although elevations in serum (S) activity (A) of transaminases and bilirubin concentration are documented, increased SA of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is uncommon. Two cases of PCR confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection and high ALP SA are presented. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 49-year-old man was hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. ALP SA was 250 U/L, and that of GGT 322 U/L, suggesting a hepatic origin of the former. SA of ALT and AST was elevated to 295 and 271 U/L, respectively. A liver ultrasound suggested fatty infiltration, and excluded bile duct dilatation and space occupying lesions. The patient improved in association with treatment. SA of AST and ALT trended down; however that of ALP remained elevated, ranging from 187 U/L to 231 U/L on the day of discharge. A 75-year-old man complaining of fever, fatigue and shortness of breath for four days was hospitalized with COVID-19. Initial tests revealed an ALP and GGT SAs of 673 U/L and 949 U/L, respectively, and normal SA of AST, ALT and S bilirubin. An MRCP excluded biliary obstruction. ALP SA remained in the 800 U/L range until discharge, without changes in the rest of the hepatic panel. Both patients had an unrevealing liver disease workup and were given an outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: Increased ALP SA has been reported in 1.8 % of patients with COVID-19. SARSCoV- 2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor found on hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells to enter its target cells; thus, the virus may cause cellular injury or impair the function of the liver transporters leading to cholestasis. Sepsis is also associated with cholestasis by the effect of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6). In this context, IL-6 is a driver of the cytokine storm seen in COVID-19. However, liver failure has not been reported in COVID-19; this may be explained by the reported protective effect that IL-6 exerts on the liver as a mediator of liver regeneration.	false
0	Meld score as a predictor of mortality in patients with SARS-COV-2: A new application for a classic scoring system. INTRODUCTION: The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score predicts liver disease severity based on serum creatinine, serum total bilirubin, and INR and has been shown to be useful in predicting mortality in patients with liver disease. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was noted to cause an influenza-like disease with significant morbidity and mortality. METHOD(S): This is a single center retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) between March of 2020 and May of 2020. Our study aimed to validate the utility of the MELD score in predicting mortality in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome is all cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes include hospital lengthof- stay, ICU admission rate and ICU length of stay. RESULT(S): The MELD score was evaluated in a cohort of 71 patients. The analysis included 31/71 (43.66%) men with a mean age of 66+/-16 years. The median MELD score was 28.8. A cutoff value of 30 was assigned to stratify patients into low and high risk groups. Mortality rate for patients with a MELD score (, 30) was 20.45% versus 45% (P = 0.0429. Hospital length of stay for patients with a low score was 6.13 days versus 7.7 days (P = 0.4560). ICU admission was 22.73% for patients stratified into the low group versus 45% (P = 0.0707). ICU length of stay for patients with a low score was 9.27 days versus 12.18 days (P = 0.4418). CONCLUSION(S): The MELD score is a valid prognostic score that can be used as a reliable predictor of mortality in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Laboratory tests in the diagnosis of covid-19. The gold standard for routine microbiological diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is quantitation of viral RNA in respiratory specimens by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific IgM and IgG antibodies in patient sera are additional diagnostic tests. It has been known that virus release begins a few days before clinical signs appear, and therefore, beginning from 2-3 days before the manifestation of clinical symptoms, virus RNA can be detected in the respiratory tract during the symptomatic period of the disease. Since the viral load is higher in lower respiratory tract samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate, PCR positivity rate might be found higher compared to nasopharyngeal samples. Confirmatory PCR tests require specific equipment and trained personnel, and they are also time-consuming and costly. Antibody assays are simple, faster tests, do not require much equipment and applicable in any laboratory. They can even be performed with 2-3 drops of blood collected from the finger tip of patients using relatively inexpensive chromatographic-rapid tests. These tests can be used in the later period of the disease since specific antibodies appear on the 7-10th day of clinical signs in patients with COVID-19. Rapid antibody card tests have an average specificity and sensitivity, while antibody tests using microELISA have higher sensitivity and specificity.Copyright © 2020, Duzce University Medical School.

0	Epidemiology's dual social commitment: to science and health. Matching epidemiology's aspirations to actual delivery of goods valuable for population health depends both on the scientific and operational capabilities of epidemiology and on the degree to which the goods meet its contract with society. Epidemiology's capabilities have remarkably advanced in recent decades, although research gaps have appeared during the current Covid-19 pandemic. Epidemiology's social contract reflecting a dual commitment to science and health could arguably be entirely met by producing research results under conditions variously described as objective, impartial, neutral, independent and handing such results to decision makers and the public at large. However a closer examination shows that the four adjectives address sharply distinct issues, with distinct practical implications, and that the epidemiologist responsibility is 'de facto' involved beyond providing research results. Hence the epidemiologist's engagement should encompass arguing from a science-for-health viewpoint and proactively driving the results into decision processes on public health issues.

0	Novel finding of protein-losing enteropathy in a patient with collagenous duodenitis and colitis complicated by COVID-19 infection. INTRODUCTION: Collagenous colitis (CC) classically produces watery diarrhea attributed to a thick collagen layer blocking colonic reabsorption of water/electrolytes. Four cases of CC have been associated with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), but CC by itself should not produce PLE because the colon does not reabsorb amino acids. About ten cases of collagenous duodenitis with CC have been reported, but none had (severe) PLE. A novel case is reported of severe PLE associated with collagenous duodenitis and CC. This association is biologically reasonable because duodenum/small bowel is responsible for amino acid absorption, which could be blocked by collagenous duodenitis. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 65-year-old female with a heavy smoking history and no prior renal insufficiency, presented with 5 watery stools/day and 14 kg involuntary weight loss for 3 months. Physical exam revealed dry mucous membranes and non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed serum creatinine 5 3.61 mg/dL (normal: 0.6-1.3 mg/dL). Stool tests for Clostridium difficile toxins and ova and parasites were negative. Stool culture for bacterial pathogens was sterile. Abdomino-pelvic CT was within normal limits. Colonoscopy with biopsy of endoscopically normal colonic mucosa revealed CC (Fig. 1). She was treated with aggressive IV hydration and budesonide with reversal of renal failure. She was readmitted 1 month later for refractory nausea and vomiting. Physical exam revealed severe anasarca, with albumin 5 2.3 g/dl (normal: 3.5-4.9 g/dL), normal liver and cardiac functions and no proteinuria. Stool alpha-1-antitrypsin was 369 mg/dl (normal: < 54 mg/dl), diagnostic of PLE. EGD revealed endoscopically normal duodenum. Histopathology of endoscopic biopsies showed severe collagenous duodenitis (Figs. 2, 3). She was diagnosed with severe PLE, from collagenous duodenitis/CC and malnutrition, treated with azathioprine and budesonide. She returned 2 months later with dyspnea, worsening diarrhea, severe hypoalbuminemia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. She tested positive for COVID-19. She was discharged 11 days later without dyspnea and TPN was initiated. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that simultaneous presentation of collagenous duodenitis/CC can result in PLE due to the thick collagen layer preventing absorption of amino acids in small bowel and water/electrolytes in colon. Immunosuppression from hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and malnutrition from PLE rendered this patient susceptible to severe COVID- 19 infection. (Figure Presented).	false
0	COVID-19 Infection and Its Influence in Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide, challenging healthcare resources and communities to an unprecedent degree. Simultaneously, the amount of clinical and scientific information released has overwhelmed journal platforms. Objectives This review aims to summarize the available diagnostic tools and current guidelines to safely assist patients while limiting the exposure of otolaryngologists during this pandemic. Data Synthesis Key articles were retrieved from the following databases: PubMed, Lancet, Springer Nature, BioMed Central, JAMA network and MEDLINE, as well as updated documents from the Spanish Ministry of Health, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Spanish Association of Surgeons, ENT-UK, American College of Surgeons, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. The terms used for the search were: COVID-19, Test COVID, Surgery in COVID, 2019-nCoV, 'coronavirus', and SARS-CoV-2. A total of 10,245 papers were retrieved. The inclusion criteria for the review included: COVID-19 testing (n 1/4 531), society guidelines for otolaryngology-head and neck surgery patient care in the outpatient clinic (n 1/4 10) and surgical (n 1/4 18) settings. Studies not related to COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. Conclusion Healthcare institutions around the world are outlining their own protocols regarding laboratory testing and personnel protective equipment usage based upon medical societies recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have summarized the available laboratory tests and their respective sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, clinical guidelines from different societies were reviewed and summarized to facilitate guidance for otolaryngologists in the operating room and in the clinical settings.Copyright © 2020 by Thieme Revinter Publicacoes Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	false
0	FATORES PREDITORES DE PERMANENCIA EM UTI EM PACIENTES COM COVID-19 TRATADOS COM PLASMA CONVALESCENTE. Objetivos: Ate o momento, nenhuma droga se mostrou efetiva no tratamento da COVID-19. O uso de plasma coletado de doadores convalescentes pode ser uma alternativa terapeutica nos casos de formas graves da doenca. Analisamos uma serie de casos de pacientes criticos com COVID-19 tratados com plasma convalescente, a fim de definir fatores preditores de tempo de permanencia em unidades de terapia intensiva (UTI). Materiais e metodos: Cinquenta e sete pacientes com diagnostico de COVID-19 confirmado por RT-PCR e pneumonia grave foram recrutados em UTI's em tres hospitais terciarios no Brasil. Doses de 200 a 600 ml de plasma convalescente foram administradas. As seguintes variaveis foram analisadas a fim de definir preditores de tempo de internacao em UTI: titulos de anticorpos neutralizantes dos pacientes antes da transfusao (NAbsP), titulos de anticorpos neutralizantes das unidades de plasma transfundidas (NAbsT), grupo ABO dos pacientes, escore Severity organ failure assessment (SOFA) no Dia 0 (dia da administracao do plasma), uso de quaisquer outras terapeuticas (hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina, tocilizumab, imunoglobulina) e presenca de comorbidades. A analise estatistica foi feita com modelos multivariados considerando-se nivel de significancia de 5%, utilizando o software SPSS. Resultados e discussao: NAbs T, uso de outras terapeuticas (hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina, tocilizumab, imunoglobulina), grupo ABO e comorbidades sao preditores de tempo de permanencia em UTI. Altos titulo de anticorpos neutralizantes dos produtos transfundidos e o uso de outras terapeuticas foram associados a reducao nos tempos de permanencia em UTI. Observou-se que quanto maior o titulo de NAbsT, menor o tempo de permanencia em UTI. O acrescimo de uma unidade no titulo de neutralizantes por ml de plasma transfundido resulta em reducao de 6,9% no tempo de permanencia em UTI (Mean ratio - MR= 0,931, 95% IC 0,907-0,956; p<0,001). O uso de outras terapeuticas tambem resultou em menores tempos de permanencia em UTI (MR=0,650; 95% IC 0,480-0,879; p=0,005). Por outro lado, a presenca de comorbidades (MR=3,438; 95% IC 1,296-9,123; p=0.013), os grupos sanguineos A e AB quando comparados a pacientes B e O foram associados a maiores tempos de permanencia em UTI (MR=1.298; 95% IC 1,136-1,483; p<0,001). NAbsP e SOFA no D0 nao tiveram impacto nos tempos de internacao em UTI. Conclusao: Apesar das limitacoes de um estudo nao controlado, nossas analises revelam dados interessantes acerca dos pacientes com COVID-19 tratados com plasma convalescente Transfusao de plasma convalescente de altos titulos parece reduzir o tempo de permanencia em UTI. Por outro lado, o titulo dos anticorpos neutralizantes produzidos pelos proprios pacientes nao teve impacto no tempo de internacao em UTI. Pacientes com grupos sanguineos A e AB e com comorbidades estao associados a maiores tempos de internacao em UTI. Sao necessarios mais estudos a fim de confirmar tais achados.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Systematically comparing COVID-19 with the 2009 influenza pandemic for hospitalized patients. Objectives: This study aimed to comprehensively compare the clinical features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hospitalized 2009 influenza pandemic patients. Method(s): Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google scholar were systematically searched to identify studies related to COVID-19 and the 2009 influenza pandemic. The pooled incidence rates of clinical features were estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. Result(s): The incidence rates of fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia/muscle pain, or vomiting were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. The incidence rates of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease/hypertension and diabetes, were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. In contrast, comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza compared with COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the estimated rates of intensive care unit admission, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, treatment with antibiotics, and fatality were comparable between hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients. Conclusion(s): This study comprehensively estimated the differences and similarities of the clinical features and burdens of hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients. This information will be important to better understand the current COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality of patients with STEMI: a systematic review and meta-analysis. AIMS: Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, hospitals reported declining numbers of patients admitted with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), indicating that the pandemic might keep patients from seeking urgent medical treatment. However, data on outcomes and mortality rates are inconsistent between studies., METHODS: A literature search and meta-analysis were performed on studies reporting the mortality of patients with STEMI admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Additionally, prehospital and intrahospital delay times were evaluated., RESULTS: Outcomes of a total of 50 123 patients from 10 studies were assessed. Our study revealed that, despite a significant reduction in overall admission rates of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic (incidence rate ratio=0.789, 95% CI 0.730 to 0.852, I2=77%, p<0.01), there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (OR=1.178, 95% CI 0.926 to 1.498, I2=57%, p=0.01) compared with patients with STEMI admitted before the outbreak. Time from the onset of symptoms to first medical contact was similar (mean difference (MD)=33.4 min, 95% CI -10.2 to 77.1, I2=88%, p<0.01) while door-to-balloon time was significantly prolonged in those presenting during the pandemic (MD=7.3 min, 95% CI 3.0 to 11.7, I2=95%, p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in admission of patients with STEMI was not associated with a significant increase of hospital mortality rates. The causes for reduced incidence rates remain speculative. However, the analysed data indicate that acute and timely medical care of these patients has been maintained during the pandemic in most countries.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally as a severe pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates antigen-specific antibody responses. Multiple serologic tests have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. However, which antigens are most suitable for serological testing remains poorly understood. Specifically, which antigens have the highest sensitivity and specificity for serological testing and which have the least cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses are currently unknown. Previous studies have shown that the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein has very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the S2 domain of the S protein, and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) show low-level cross-reactivity. Therefore, S1 is considered more specific than the native homotrimer of the S protein, and the receptor-binding domain as an antigen to test patient antibodies is more sensitive than the native N protein. In addition, an increasing number of studies have used multi-antigen protein arrays to screen serum from convalescent patients with COVID-19. Antigen combinations demonstrated improved performance as compared to each individual antigen. For rapid antigen detection, the sensitivity of the test is higher in the first week of onset of the disease with high viral loads. Highly sensitive and specific immunological diagnostic methods for antibodies or those that directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples would be beneficial for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

0	Field-Effect Sensors for Virus Detection: From Ebola to SARS-CoV-2 and Plant Viral Enhancers. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human infectious disease provoked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, no specific vaccines or drugs against COVID-19 are available. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential in order to slow the virus spread and to contain the disease outbreak. Hence, new diagnostic tests and devices for virus detection in clinical samples that are faster, more accurate and reliable, easier and cost-efficient than existing ones are needed. Due to the small sizes, fast response time, label-free operation without the need for expensive and time-consuming labeling steps, the possibility of real-time and multiplexed measurements, robustness and portability (point-of-care and on-site testing), biosensors based on semiconductor field-effect devices (FEDs) are one of the most attractive platforms for an electrical detection of charged biomolecules and bioparticles by their intrinsic charge. In this review, recent advances and key developments in the field of label-free detection of viruses (including plant viruses) with various types of FEDs are presented. In recent years, however, certain plant viruses have also attracted additional interest for biosensor layouts: Their repetitive protein subunits arranged at nanometric spacing can be employed for coupling functional molecules. If used as adapters on sensor chip surfaces, they allow an efficient immobilization of analyte-specific recognition and detector elements such as antibodies and enzymes at highest surface densities. The display on plant viral bionanoparticles may also lead to long-time stabilization of sensor molecules upon repeated uses and has the potential to increase sensor performance substantially, compared to conventional layouts. This has been demonstrated in different proof-of-concept biosensor devices. Therefore, richly available plant viral particles, non-pathogenic for animals or humans, might gain novel importance if applied in receptor layers of FEDs. These perspectives are explained and discussed with regard to future detection strategies for COVID-19 and related viral diseases.

0	Psychological Status Among Anesthesiologists and Operating Room Nurses During the Outbreak Period of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) posed a major threat to public health. Anesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses are at high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19. We conducted a single-center survey to investigate the psychological status and perceived social support among operation room (OR) medical staffs during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 197 OR medical staffs were enrolled in the survey. The authors performed a cohort study during the period of Wuhan lockdown and then conducted a longitudinal follow-up after lifting of lockdown. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess perceived social support. We compared the psychological status of OR medical staffs before and after lifting of Wuhan lockdown. Results: During the period of city lockdown, 177 (89.8%) had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in OR medical staffs was 41.6 and 43.1% under Wuhan lockdown, while 13.2 and 15.7% after lifting of lockdown (P = 0.002, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, living in suburb areas, shortage of protective equipment and close contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety severity in the OR medical staffs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: OR medical staffs exhibited high incidence of anxiety and depression faced with the high risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients. More social support and social recognition for anesthesiologists and OR nurses might potentially help them relieve their psychological pressure.

0	Study of anxiety, stress, and depression level among medical students during covid-19 pandemic phase in jamnagar city. Background: Medical education is a known stressor for medical students. Anxiety, depression, and stress are common in medical students due to different stressors in medical education, as suggested by the previous studies. Aim and Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate mental status and prevalence of anxiety, stress, and depression among medical students during coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 phase. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was conducted in 250 1st-year MBBS students of Shri M. P. Shah Government Medical College, Jamnagar, after getting approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Pre-structured questionnaire-based DASS21 scale was used to conduct this study through Google form after obtaining written consent from the students. Result(s): In our study, we found that prevalence of anxiety, stress, and depression in 1st-year medical students was 17.20%, 15.60%, and 10.80%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In our study, we found that anxiety, depression, and stress are present in medical students. In COVID-19 phase, students are not attending medical colleges and all the teaching process is online. Even at home, medical students are suffering from anxiety, depression, and stress. Early evaluation and intervention should be done to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress in medical students.Copyright © 2020, Mr Bhawani Singh. All rights reserved.	false

0	The role of chest CT in management of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A longitudinal multi-center study in Chongqing, China. Background: Multiple societies including the Fleischner Society do not recommend that CT is routinely used in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, this advice is based on the limited evidence. In this study, we aim to confirm whether it is necessary to do CT scans in SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections by summarizing the longitudinal chest CT and clinical features of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Method(s): A total of 33 individuals (14 men and 19 women) with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data of CT positive and negative groups were compared. Longitudinal chest CT scans were reviewed for CT features and analyzed for temporal change. Result(s): Thirty-two (97%) individuals had positive results for first RT-PCR testing. For clinical data, only monocyte count showed a significant difference between CT positive and negative groups. For first chest CT, only eighteen (54.5%) individuals had abnormal manifestations, common CT features were GGO (88.9%) and consolidation (33.3%), the median number of segments involved was 3.0 (1.0-7.5). No case in CT negative group was abnormal on the follow-up CT. Three patterns of evolution throughout series of CT were observed in CT positive group, including gradual improvement (12, 66.7%), mismatch to improvement (3, 16.7%) and mild progression to improvement (3, 16.7%). On last CT scans, most cases had radiographic improvement but residual abnormalities. Significant differences were exhibited in density, long diameter, number of lung segments involved, and percentage of consolidation between the first and last CT scans. All cases had stable conditions and finally confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests without developing into severe pneumonia. Conclusion(s): Considering poor performance of CT in screening, stable conditions during follow-up, and good outcomes in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, we confirm that it is unnecessary to do CT scans in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.Copyright © The author(s).	false

0	Irreversible Adsorption of Serum Proteins onto Nanoparticles. When a material comes in contact with serum or plasma, proteins will immediately adsorb to its surface. The extent of serum protein adsorption as well as the composition of the protein corona is thought to be decisive for the biological fate. The understanding of the mechanism underlying the concurrent adsorption of multiple proteins and the exact ways by which the adsorbed proteins interact with the biological setting, is still rudimentary. For both cases, a correct estimate of the composition of the protein corona is the key for an improved understanding. The protein corona composition is typically analyzed indirectly through analysis of the supernatant after protein desorption. However, in most cases the particles are not analyzed afterward in order to ensure that all proteins indeed have desorbed. Here, the results related to the analysis of the amounts of proteins in the corona are reported, focusing on the desorbed as well as the fraction of proteins that do not desorb. Irreversible protein adsorption can be observed in some cases. The results show that, in addition of the analysis of the supernatant, analysis of the particles is of critical importance to fully characterize the protein corona formed on nanoparticles.	false
0	Liver damage impact on the severity and evolution of patients admitted by coronavirus 2019 disease. Background: COVID-19 is commonly manifested with respiratory pathology, but has also been reported to cause liver damage Our aim is to assess in admitted patients with COVID-19 whether liver damage is associated with a worse prognosis and if there are differences between the moment of the onset of liver damage (at or during admission) Methods: We use an unicentric retrospective study with adult patients admitted with COVID-19 (PCR diagnosis) Patients with previous liver disease or damage and those with suspected drug hepatotoxicity were excluded 303 patients were registered and their baseline characteristics were determined: age, sex and chronic diseases (cardiovascular risk factors, pneumological and cardiological diseases and chronic renal impairment). Liver damage was defined as ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP or GGT elevation over our laboratory ranges COVID-19 moderate stage is considered if advanced interstitial radiological pattern or pneumonia is presented and severe stage if it associates tachypnea, hypoxia or respiratory failure. Deterioration is defined as a more serious stage progression and improvement as a change to a less serious stage Statistical analysis was performed by age-adjusted binary logistic regression. The significance level (p-value) was 5% (alpha=0'05). Result(s): Males predominate (51'3%) with an average age of 69'3 years old The overall prevalence of liver damage was 60 9%, with 46 4% liver damage at admission and the remaining 14 5% during admission (74 8% for the first 8 days). At admission 52.7% had moderate stage and 34 1% severe Subgroups with and without liver damage had no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Significant association between liver damage was observed at moderate and severe stages (p 0'011 and p 0'031) During admission 66 2% improved the initial stage, but 13 2% deteriorated (moderate to severe) 14 9% required admission to ICU and 21 9% died At admission it was observed that patients with liver damage had a higher risk of deterioration (p 0'001) and a lower probability of improvement (p 0'001) If liver damage occurs during admission there is still a higher risk of deterioration (p 0'002); however, there is a tendency without statistical significance, regarding the likelihood of non improvement (p 0'055) Conclusion(s): The liver damage prevalence in our study in admitted COVID-19 patients is high and is related to greater severity and less favorable evolution, whether it appears at or during admission Therefore, it is important to monitor liver function parameters.	false
0	Use of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA for Assessment of Allograft Injury in Kidney Transplant Recipients During the Time of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic. Background. Kidney allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of rejection. Under the current extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which social distancing is key to limiting the spread of the virus, the model used to provide care to transplant recipients has undergone a very rapid transformation. In the spirit of medical distancing, we have been using the donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) test for screening for rejection. Methods. This article describes our experience with this approach between March 15th and May 20th, 2020. Results. This test was obtained for-cause in 23 patients and for monitoring in 9 patients. Normal results aided in forgoing biopsy in 63% of the patients for whom the test was obtained in the outpatient setting. The test is neither 100% sensitive nor specific for rejection; however, when used in combination with the available clinical information, it can be used for determining whether bringing in a transplant recipient into a medical facility is necessary. Conclusions. In the event COVID-19 becomes a long-term challenge for our community, noninvasive biomarkers such as the dd-cfDNA may become more relevant than ever in enhancing our ability to care for our transplant patients while maximizing the distancing measures.	false
0	Comparison of Pre-Procedural COVID-19 PCR Testing on Routine Endoscopic Practice Pre- and Post-Societal Reopening. INTRODUCTION: Current GI society recommendations on resuming endoscopy in the COVID-19 era are based on expert consensus with limited data. Previously, we reported routine COVID-19 PCR testing of asymptomatic patients prior to societal reopening may be low-yield despite theoretically decreasing staff exposure to carriers. The impact of societal reopening on pre-procedure testing remains unknown. The aim of this study is to compare yield of routine COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic individuals prior to endoscopy pre- and post-societal reopening. METHOD(S): This retrospective cohort study reviewed all patients undergoing endoscopic procedures at our combined inpatient/outpatient facility 4/13/2020 to 6/15/2020. Outpatients were called prior to the planned procedure with a COVID-19 screening questionnaire. Patients with flagged responses during this verbal screening were postponed. Those with negative verbal screening underwent PCR testing. Patients with a negative PCR underwent procedure, whereas positive PCR patients were rescheduled. Inpatients requiring procedures received a rapid in-house test. Emergent cases were performed regardless of the test result using full barrier personal protective equipment. Patients were again screened verbally and temperature checked day of procedure. The proportion of positive tests pre and post re-opening were compared with the Fisher's exact test. Our data were compared to publicly available population-based test results from our county, Miami-Dade, FL. RESULT(S): 1,406 PCR swabs were performed of which 4 patients were positive (test positive rate: 0.28%, 95% CI: 0.08-0.72%). During the pre-opening period, 1 of 396 PCR swabs was positive (percent positive: 0.25%, 95% CI: 0.01-1.4%). Post-opening, 3 of 1,010 PCR swabs were positive (percent positive: 0.30%, 95% CI: 0.06-0.87%). There was no difference in the rate of positive tests pre and post societal re-opening (0.25% vs 0.30%, P . 0.99). Demographic data qualify our county as intermediate prevalence for COVID-19. There have been no reported COVID-19 cases among our endoscopy staff. CONCLUSION(S): Despite a significant increase in procedural volume post-societal reopening, rates of asymptomatic COVID infections remained stable compared to pre-reopening. Verbal screening tools remain effective, but not perfect, in identifying patients who should have their procedure deferred in intermediate prevalence areas. PCR testing may play an adjunctive role to prevent exposure from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients.	false
0	Liver function as an assessment of disease progression in covid-19: A case series. INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has reached pandemic status with over 2 million cases in the US and now over 100,000 deaths. Liver impairment has been reported as a common manifestation of the virus although its current clinical significance remains unclear. We present two cases of patients treated for severe COVID-19 at our institution who experienced significant hepatic injury. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: Case 1:A 78-year-old male with COPD and congestive heart failure was admitted with COVID-19. His admission was complicated by severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and a prolonged hospital stay. Throughout his course he sustained worsening hepatic function, with increasing aminotransferases and hyperbilirubinemia in addition to thrombocytopenia, (Table 1). Serum ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer were used as markers of disease severity and appeared to correlate with his LFTs throughout his hospital course, (Table 2). Case 2:A 37-year-old male with no medical history was treated in our ICU with severe COVID-19. On hospital day 13 he developed acute liver injury with significantly elevated transaminitis. His ALT peaked at 2304 U/L, AST at 2376 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 134 U/L, with a bilirubin of 10.9 mg/dL. Hepatic ultrasound revealed moderate hepatomegaly but no evidence of thrombosis. His liver injury appeared to correlate with worsening respiratory failure and continues to improve as his clinical course stabilizes. DISCUSSION: Liver injury is commonly reported in patients with COVID-19, with abnormalities in LFTs seen in up to 53% of hospitalized patients. The most commonly documented abnormalities are elevated transaminases thought to be caused by the direct pathogenic effect of the virus targeting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are known to be present on hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Other potential etiologies for liver injury may be as a result of a cytokine storm the virus triggers or hepatotoxicity from several therapies being trialed, including Remdesivir. Several studies, including one by Cai Qingxian et al., have demonstrated a correlation between abnormal liver function and worsening disease severity, particularly in progressive pneumonitis. While there is robust data on several inflammatory markers for disease progression, there is a paucity of literature on the importance of monitoring LFTs. Further research is vital to better understand the long-term effects of hepatic impairment as a result of COVID-19.	false
0	Epidemiology, prevention and control strategies of coronavirus covid 19 in iran: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Following the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020, of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 as a global and emergency state of international health emergency; posing a serious threat to the physical health and lives of individuals transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. The virus causes respiratory symptoms and damages to other organs, sometimes leading to death in case of exacerbation of symptoms. AIM: This study was conducted through reviewing various articles related to COVID-19 disease, with the purpose of reviewing the epidemiology, prevention and control strategies of COVID-19 coronavirus in Iran. METHOD(S): In the present review study, the articles indexing in the Persian and Latin databases of SID, Magiran, PubMed, Scopus, Scholar, Web of Science, Embase, MedRxiv, and WHO were examined based on MESH keywords. Finally, 38 articles, 5 protocols and reports were reviewed. RESULT(S): According to the report of the WHO on July 22, 2020, 14,765,256 people worldwide have been infected and 612,054 people have died of this virus. Moreover, in Iran, according to the WHO report, 278,827 people were infected and 14,634 people died of the virus until July 22, 2020. Respiratory droplets are the main way of transmission and it can also be transmitted through close contact. According to research, 51% of patients with chronic disease show symptoms such as fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%), muscle pain (11%), fatigue (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), had rhinorrhea (4%), chest pain (2%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea and vomiting (1%). There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and clinical treatment for COVID-19 has so far been limited to prophylaxis and palliative care. Quarantine alone is not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Basic health measurements to prevent the spread of the disease include frequent handwashing and the use of personal protective equipment such as masks. CONCLUSION(S): Extensive research can be the key to solve the existing challenges in the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. The best ways to fight the new corona disease include educating the people, providing accurate information, providing personal protective equipment, canceling meetings and emphasizing citizens homeliving and regular handwashing, observing social distancing, and finally identifying suspicious cases and quarantine.Copyright © 2020 Monireh Rezaee Moradali, Masoumeh Simbar, Sahar Roozbahani, Fatemeh Yahyavi Koochaksaraei, Pooya Hosseinzadeh, MoradAli Zareipour, Fatemeh Bayat, Maryam Amighi,.	false
0	Low iron mitigates viral survival: insights from evolution, genetics, and pandemics-a review of current hypothesis. Background: Upon re-examination of our human history, evolutionary perspectives, and genetics, a prevailing iron deficiency phenotype appears to have evolved to protect the human race from extinction. Body: In this review, we summarize the evolutionary and genetic perspectives pointing towards the hypothesis that low iron mitigates infection. The presence of infection promotes the generation of resistance alleles, and there are some evolutionary and genetic clues that suggest the presence of an iron deficiency phenotype that may have developed to protect against infection. Examples include the relative paucity of iron overload genes given the essential role of iron, as well as the persistence of iron deficiency among populations in spite of public health efforts to treat it. Additional examination of geographic areas with severe iron deficiency in the setting of pandemics including H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19 reveals that areas with higher prevalence of iron deficiency are less affected. RNA viruses have several evolutionary adaptations which suggest their absolute need for iron, and this dependency may be exploited during treatment. Conclusion(s): RNA viruses pose a unique challenge to modern healthcare, with an average of 2-3 new pathogens being discovered yearly. Their overarching requirements for iron, along with human evolutionary and genetic adaptations which favored an iron deficiency phenotype, ultimately suggest the potential need for iron control in these infections.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false

0	A cross-sectional study evaluating hospitalization rates for chronic limb-threatening ischemia during the COVID-19 outbreak in Campania, Italy. The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prompted measures of disease containment by the Italian government with a national lockdown on March 9, 2020. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of hospitalization and mode of in-hospital treatment of patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) before and during lockdown in the Campania region of Italy. The study population includes all patients with CLTI hospitalized in Campania over a 10-week period: 5 weeks before and 5 weeks during lockdown (n = 453). Patients were treated medically and/or underwent urgent revascularization and/or major amputation of the lower extremities. Mean age was 69.2 +/- 10.6 years and 27.6% of the patients were women. During hospitalization, 21.9% of patients were treated medically, 78.1% underwent revascularization, and 17.4% required amputations. In the weeks during the lockdown, a reduced rate of hospitalization for CLTI was observed compared with the weeks before lockdown (25 vs 74/100,000 inhabitants/year; incidence rate ratio: 0.34, 95% CI 0.32-0.37). This effect persisted to the end of the study period. An increased amputation rate in the weeks during lockdown was observed (29.3% vs 13.4%; p < 0.001). This study reports a reduced rate of CLTI-related hospitalization and an increased in-hospital amputation rate during lockdown in Campania. Ensuring appropriate treatment for patients with CLTI should be prioritized, even during disease containment measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar conditions.	false
0	PIN81 Within Country Regional Inequalities of the Incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Caused By Sars-COV-2 VIRUS in Hungary. Objectives: The first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on the 4th of March 2020 in Hungary. The aim of our study is to analyse the regional inequalities in the occurrence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in Hungary. Method(s): Data derived from the National Surveillance System (OSZIR) of the National Public Health Center (Nemzeti Nepegeszsegugyi Kozpont) of Hungary. Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in highly specialised laboratories designated for SARS-CoV-2 virus diagnostic. Data of laboratory confirmed cases were reported to the National Surveillance System. The period from the onset of first COVID-19 case up to 7th July 2020 was covered. Data were analysed according to 20 counties of Hungary. Result(s): Altogether 4,205 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified in Hungary resulting in an incidence of 4.35 cases per 10,000 population. The number of novel coronavirus daily cases reached its peak in Hungary between 10-23 April with higher than 100 novel cases per day (0.102 new cases per 10,000 population). There was a 28.88 times higher incidence of COVID-19 in the county with the lowest (Bekes 0.39) and with the highest (Budapest 11.36) occurrence. We found 4 counties with very high COVID-19 incidence (cases per 10,000 population): Budapest (11.36), Komarom-Esztergom county (10.20), Zala county (9.8) and Fejer county (9.05). The lowest frequency of COVID-19 was observed in the following counties (cases per 10,000 population): Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok (0.46), Hajdu-Bihar (0.44), Bacs-Kiskun (0.42) and Bekes (0.39). Conclusion(s): We found 28.88-fold differences in the incidence of COVID-19 cases among Hungarian counties with the lowest and highest occurrence. The highest incidence was observed in the capital city (Budapest) and in counties characterized by either nosocomial infections or cumulative cases in social institutions.Copyright © 2020	false
0	PIN34 COVID 19 - What Is the Health-Economic Economically Justifiable Price of Lockdown?. Objectives: Many European governments have imposed emergency lockdown measures to reduce interpersonal contact and slow the spread of COVID 19. This has led to substantial reductions in transmission rates and burden of disease but at a very high economic cost. Using health-economic principles, we assess whether lockdown is a cost-effective intervention in five European countries. Method(s): An SIR dynamic transmission model was fitted to COVID 19 incidence data from the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Italy to estimate total case numbers with and without a government-imposed lockdown. Hospitalisation cost and lockdown costs (based on estimated reductions in GDP) were used to estimate total cost, with QALYs and life-years estimated from observed mortality rates. In the scenario without lockdown, hospitalisations were capped based on health-care capacity, transmission adjusted for 'natural' social distancing, and GDP reduced to account for the impact of disease. Result(s): R0 before lockdown varied from 2.20 to 2.85 and after from 0.40 to 0.75. After the initial upswing, R0 varied between 1.36 and 1.77 in the no-lockdown scenario. Infection rates without lockdown were between 100 and 260 times higher than with lockdown. Incremental costs ranged from $3bn in France to $116bm in Germany, driven by the size of the economy in Germany and high hospitalisation rates observed in France. Per capita costs were highest in Italy at $1,648 per person and lowest in France at $52 per person. Incremental QALYs ranged from 12m in Italy to 30m in France, driven by differences in mortality rates. ICERs varied from $115 per QALY in France to $8,300 per QALY in Italy. Incremental costs per life-year followed similar patterns. Conclusion(s): Lockdown is an expensive but cost-effective intervention. Whilst the average cost across all five countries is over $1,000 per person, cost-effectiveness is driven by huge reductions in hospitalisation and deaths.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 and Hyperimmune sera: A feasible plan B to fight against coronavirus. Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different treatment strategies have been explored. These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production. However, other potential options should be more avidly investigated since vaccine production on a worldwide level, and the anti-vaccination movement, also known as anti-vax or vaccine hesitancy by many communities, are still real obstacles without a ready solution. This review presents recent findings on the potential therapeutic advantages of heterologous serotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19. We present not only the effective use in animal models of hyperimmune sera against this coronavirus but also strategies, and protocols for the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera. Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	A systematic review involving 11,187 participants evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on anxiety and depression in pregnant women. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has started to spread within China since the end of December 2019. As a special population, the pregnant and delivery women maybe influenced both in physical and psychological aspects. The meta-analysis was conducted about mental health in pregnant and delivery women., METHODS: We searched both MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library in English and CBM, CNKI, WANFANG and CSSCI in Chinese to find literature from December 2019 to 31 July 2020 related to COVID-19 and mental health in patient with pregnancy and delivery, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The prevalence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed., RESULTS: A total of 11,187 subjects were included in 15 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data by Revman 5.2. The results showed that the prevalence of depression was 30% (95% CI: 0.23-0.37), the prevalence of anxiety was 34% (95% CI: 0.26-0.43) and prevalence of both anxiety and depression was 18% (95% CI: 0.09-0.29). The prevalence of anxiety (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.39-3.31, Z = 3.47, p=.0005), depression (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07-3.56, Z = 2.19, p=.03) were higher than that of controls. Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these prevalence estimates. Subgroup analysis was taken according to assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity., CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, both depression and anxiety in women with pregnancy and delivery during COVID-19 pandemic although the significant heterogeneity detected in studies. We must interpret the results with caution and also put attention to this result. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system.	false
0	Two Cases of Post-intubation Laryngotracheal Stenosis Occurring after Severe COVID-19. We experienced two cases of post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis (PILS) occurring in patients after acute COVID-19 in a relatively narrow time period. The patients required mechanical ventilation for 9 days in one and 28 days in the other. In both cases, the patients were discharged but later developed symptoms of cough and dyspnea, which were later diagnosed as PILS. Persistent cough and dyspnea are common symptoms in both PILS and the recovery phase of severe COVID-19. For this reason, PILS should be considered in the differential diagnosis post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, the prevalence of PILS may be greater than that of other critical diseases in severe COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Factors Associated with the Exacerbation of COVID-19 Disease: A Case-control Study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the factors associated with the exacerbations of COVID-19., BACKGROUND: At present, COVID-19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world. Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19., DESIGN: Case-control Study., METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April, 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilization group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalization. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement., RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnea between the two groups. The variables with P < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation., CONCLUSION: Clinicians may warn the exacerbation of COVID-19 facing above risk factors and associated characteristics, and adjust the diagnosis and treatment plan to delay the disease progression, reduce complications and mortality and improve the prognosis of patients., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patients with certain risk factors associated with COVID-19 diseases exacerbation should be observed and targeted by using effective early interventions.

Relato de caso: Feminino, 78 anos, previamente higida, com antecedente de obesidade grau II e hipertensao arterial sistemica. Em fevereiro de 2019 internacao hospitalar com quadro de anemia, insuficiencia renal, hipercalcemia, lesoes osseas em coluna sacral. Apos investigacao hematologica foi feito diagnostico de Mieloma Multiplo IGG LAMBDA III B ISS3 R-ISS 2, com medula ossea extensamente infiltrada de plasmocitos (cerca de 60%). Indicado tratamento quimioterapico para paciente nao elegivel ao transplante de Medula Ossea autologo, protocolo Dara -VMP (Daratumumab, velcade, melfalan, prednisona). Evolui satisfatoriamente com o tratamento proposto, reducao de mais de 90% da carga tumoral, resolucao da disfuncao renal, normalizacao da hipercalcemia e melhora das lesoes osseas. Em julho de 2020, ainda em tratamento hematologico, apresentou infecao pelo novo Sars-CoV2, necessitando de internacao hospitalar e cuidados clinicos. Durante a internacao, proximo ao decimo dia da infeccao, apresentou quadro inflamatorio importante, com aumento de citocinas inflamatorias, piora respiratoria, sendo indicado pela equipe assistencial o medicamento Tocilizumabe. Houve resolucao do quadro inflamatorio e infeccioso, porem apos 10 dias do uso da medicacao apresentou quadro de multiplos nodulos arredondados, de localizacao disseminada, com biopsia confirmando plasmocitomas de caracteristicas morfologicas anaplasicas, com KI67 elevado (80%). Realizado tambem biopsia de medula ossea com ausencia de infiltracao plasmocitaria e exames laboratoriais sericos/urinarios investigativos para mieloma multiplo mostraram-se estaveis. Discussao: Desde dezembro de 2019, a nova pneumonia por coronavirus, denominada doenca de coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pela Organizacao Mundial da Saude (OMS), tem sido uma crise de saude publica global preocupante. Pesquisas experimentais indicam que uma resposta imunologica excessiva e uma forte tempestade de citocinas, incluindo altos niveis de interleucina-6 (IL-6), sao ativadas, principalmente, em casos de evolucoes clinicas desfavoraveis. Nesse cenario, um medicamento chamado Tocilizumabe, imunoglobulina humanizada que se liga especificamente aos receptores de interleucina-6, tem se mostrado como um tratamento promissor em pacientes infectados por COVID-19. Nesse caso clinico apresentado, nossa paciente apresentou resposta satisfatoria ao tratamento da infeccao do COVID-19 apos o uso do Tocilizumabe, porem em pouco espaco de tempo, evolui com progressao neoplasica atipica, com caracteristicas celulares morfologicas diferentes da verificada no inicio do diagnostico hematologico. Entendemos que possa ter ocorrido uma mera coincidencia de recidiva tumoral com uso do medicamento, porem levanta-se a possiblidade de uma evolucao clonal apos o uso desse imunossupressor. Conclusao: Ainda que promissor no tratamento de COVID -19, novos estudos sao necessarios envolvendo a terapeutica com o medicamento Tocilizumabe, visto que o mesmo interage com sistema imunologico e, possivelmente, hematopoietico, como demonstrado no caso clinico acima descritoCopyright © 2020	false
0	Development of integrated microfluidic platform coupled with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for diagnosis of COVID-19. Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an alarming situation across the globe. Varieties of diagnostic protocols are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Many of these diagnostic protocols however, have limitations such as for example unacceptable no of false-positive and false-negative cases, particularly during the early stages of infection. At present, the real-time (quantitative) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, RT-PCR based tests are complex, expensive, time consuming and involve pre-processing of samples. A swift, sensitive, inexpensive protocol for mass screening is urgently needed to contain this pandemic. There is urgent need to harness new powerful technologies for accurate detection not only of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also combating the emergence of pandemics of new viruses as well. To overcome the current challenges, the authors propose a diagnostic protocol based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with microfluidic devices containing integrated microchannels functionalized either with vertically aligned Au/Ag coated carbon nanotubes or with disposable electrospun micro/nano-filter membranes. These devices have the potential to successfully trap viruses from diverse biological fluids/secretions including saliva, nasopharyngeal, tear etc. These can thus enrich the viral titre and enable accurate identification of the viruses from their respective Raman signatures. If the device is successfully developed and proven to detect target viruses, it would facilitate rapid screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals of COVID-19. This would be a valuable diagnostic tool not only for mass screening of current COVID-19 pandemic but also in viral pandemic outbreaks of future. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	[SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-epidemiology and prevention]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread globally since December 2019. A first wave is visible up to the end of June 2020 in many regions. This article presents a review of the current knowledge on the epidemiology and prevention. The SARS-CoV-2 predominantly replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is particularly transmitted by droplets and aerosols. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5-10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts. The incidence for the first wave in Germany can be estimated as 0.4-1.8% and excess mortality could not be observed.

0	Microfluidic-based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis. Novel coronavirus, COVID-19, erupted in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and has now spread to almost all countries in the world. Until the end of November 2020, there were over 50 x 106 people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide and it caused at least 1 x 106 deaths. These numbers are still increasing. To control the spread of the pandemic and to choose a suitable treatment plan, a fast, accurate, effective, and ready-to-use diagnostic method has become an important prerequisite. In this Review, we introduce the principles of multiple off-site and on-site detection methods for virus diagnosis, including qPCR-based, ELISA-based, CRISPR-based methods, etc. All of these methods have been successfully implanted on the microfluidic platform for rapid screening. We also summarize currently available diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Some of them not only can be used to analyze the SARS and MERS but also have the potential for COVID-19 detection after modifications. Finally, we hope that understanding of current microfluidic-based detection approaches can help physicians and researchers to develop advanced, rapid, and appropriate clinical detection techniques that reduce the financial expenditure of the society, accelerate the examination process, increase the accuracy of diagnosis, and eventually suppress the worldwide pandemic.

0	Black Lives Matter in health promotion: moving from unspoken to outspoken. Racism is a public health crisis. Black communities (including Africans, the African diaspora and people of African descent) experience worse health outcomes as demonstrated by almost any measure of health and wellbeing-e.g. life expectancy; disease prevalence; maternal mortality rates. While health promotion has its foundation in promoting equity and social justice, it is clear that however well-intended, we are not affecting meaningful change for Black communities quickly enough. Through this article, we outline the intersection of social determinants of health and anti-Black racism. We describe how in the first 8 months of 2020 Black communities around the globe have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, while also having to respond to new instances of police brutality. We assert that the time has come for health promotion to stop neutralizing the specific needs of Black communities into unspoken 'good intentions'. Instead, we offer some concrete ways for the field to become outspoken, intentional and honest in acknowledging what it will take to radically shift how we promote health and wellbeing for Black people.

0	Amplification-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 with CRISPR-Cas13a and mobile phone microscopy. The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ~100 copies/muL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Although prisoners are considered a vulnerable population, no data repository currently exists to monitor the COVID-19 incidence in Nigerian prisons. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 within the Nigerian prison system, prisons should develop detailed COVID-19 response protocols, implement enhanced point-of-care testing, and initiate contact tracing with meticulous data collection.

0	Dynamic profiles of SARS-Cov-2 infection from five Chinese family clusters in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several cases of family clusters with SARS-Cov-2 infection have been reported, there are still limited data preventing conclusions from being drawn regarding the characteristics and laboratory findings in the COVID-19 population within family clusters. In the present study, we retrospectively collected five family clusters with COVID-19 and summarized the dynamic profiles of the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, immune markers, treatment and prognosis of this population. Furthermore, we also compared clinical and laboratory data between the SARS-Cov-2 infection with family cluster (n = 21) and those without family cluster (n = 16). We demonstrated that the duration of SARS-Cov-2 replication might be varied based on the different family clusters due to their different genetic backgrounds. The onset improved lung radiology might start at the end of the SARS-Cov-2 positive period. Furthermore, the obtained results demonstrated that similar basic characteristics and clinical findings seem to exist between the cases with SARS-Cov-2 and without family clusters. The serum level of ferritin might have a different biological function and be a new biomarker for the family cluster. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are required.	false

0	A review of the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading disease worldwide. It is a real test for all health authorities including Arab countries. In this review, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world. In addition, to compare the findings of this study with other top affected countries., METHODOLOGY: We searched for official websites from the Ministries of Health and other official sources in all 22 Arab countries. Medline, Science Direct and Google Scholar websites were also used to search for COVID-19, 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus. The time period was from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020., RESULTS: As of May 31, 2020, COVID-19 has caused 290,428 confirmed cases, 3,696 deaths and 157,886 cured cases in all Arab countries. In terms of confirmed cases, Saudi Arabia followed by Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and Egypt have the highest reported cases. However, the total number of deaths was dominant in Egypt, followed by Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and UAE. In comparison to other non-Arab countries and confirmed cases, Arab countries come fourth after USA, Brazil and Russia. In terms of death, the Arab world is not listed as the top ten affected countries as only scored eight deaths per million have been recorded., CONCLUSIONS: Most Arab countries took some serious early steps to minimize the outbreak of COVID-19. At the moment, controlling the source of infection, the route of transmission and taking care of infected patients are the main challenges for health authorities in all Arab countries.

0	Knowledge and practice of personal protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent infectious pathogen causing an acute respiratory disease called corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Virus transmission may occur by contact, droplet, airborne or via contaminated surfaces. In efforts to effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak, the world health organization (WHO) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) have advised the public to practice protective measures to reduce transmission of the virus and reduce incidence of infection. These measures include hand washing, wearing masks and gloves and avoidance of touching the face with unwashed hands. The current study aimed to investigate knowledge and adherence of the Saudi population to these protective actions during the pandemic. After determining the required sample size using power analysis, a cross-sectional online self-reported survey of 5105 Saudi residents was conducted between 25th March to 17th April 2020 to evaluate public knowledge of COVID-19. Participants were all aged 18 years or above, Arabic speakers and residents of Saudi Arabia. Scores were calculated based on knowledge and adherence of the individuals to protective measures. About 90% of participants exhibited a high level of knowledge (scored 2/2) and practice (scored > 3/6) in relation to hand hygiene and wearing gloves and masks. Practice scores were positively associated with females and individuals with high income. Lower practice scores were linked to youth and residents of the northern and western regions of the Kingdom. Over two thirds of participants preferred hand washing to alcohol disinfection, and the frequency and performance of hand washing improved during the pandemic for more than half of respondents. Overall, the findings reflected high public knowledge of SARS-CoV2 transmission routes and adherence to personal protective measures. However, public awareness campaigns with an emphasis on the youth and individuals with low education and income are required to improve overall practice.	false
0	Impact of albumin corona on mucoadhesion and antimicrobial activity of carvacrol loaded chitosan nano-delivery systems under simulated gastro-intestinal conditions. Emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens has posed considerable challenges to explore and examine the natural antimicrobials (NAMs). Due to the labile nature of NAMs, nano-delivery systems (NDS) are required to protect them from physiological degradation and allow controlled delivery to the targeted site of infection. In this study, corona modified NDS were developed using bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a chitosan core (CS) for sustained delivery of carvacrol (CAR), a natural antimicrobial agent, in the intestine. The optimal nano-formulations of the core (CS-NDS) and corona modified (BSA-CS-NDS) systems were fabricated with an average diameter of 52.4+/-10.4nm and 202.6+/-6nm, respectively. A shift in zeta-potential (ZP) from positive (+21+/-3.6mV) to negative values (-18+/-2.6mV) confirmed the electrostatic deposition of BSA corona on CS core. Under the influence of various simulated gastrointestinal conditions, BSA corona provided extra stability to NDS (ZP -38.5mV), by ensuring delayed release and limited degradation in the gastric conditions. Mucoadhesive studies with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) revealed that BSA corona reduced the mucoadhesion of NDS at gastric pH, which enabled the effective delivery of CAR to the intestinal phase for successful eradication of Salmonella enterica.

The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2) pandemic, known as COVID-19, has involved the world's population in an onerous and emotionally charged challenge with serious repercussions on health and economy, engaging medical personnel, health workers, scientists and politicians in the front line. SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and is spreading worldwide. The epidemiology and ecology of the infection is not yet fully known: The virus reservoir has been identified in bats, but the intermediate host and the exact modalities of the species jump, with transmission to humans, are not yet unequivocally identified. In this scenario, laboratory medicine plays an important role, both in research and diagnostics. Today, we have more information on the nature of SARS-CoV-2: Thanks to the research work of doctors, biologists and technicians in laboratories, we obtained more insights on gene sequence, pathogenetic mechanisms, the first therapeutic hypotheses and experiments for a vaccine. The identification of the sequences of the viral genome, consisting of a single stranded RNA, has led to the rapid availability of diagnostic tests based on the application of RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction), giving a fundamental tool for the early detection of viral RNA in rhino-pharyngeal swabs, the isolation and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the tracing of contacts and the promotion of social containment measures. However, the rapid geographical spread of the virus, with its high degree of contagiousness, the percentage of serious cases requiring hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs) and the increased lethality found in some regions has caused great difficulty in the management of COVID-19 patients, due to the lack of adequate facilities and technologies. The finding of asymptomatic and/or paucisymptomatic subjects, with the virus in the incubation phase, has made even more evident the need for efficient and early diagnostics, but molecular tests, for various analytical and extra-analytical limitations, cannot be used as only diagnostic test in possible scenarios of virus spread, in the general population: A change of strategy is needed that is more adherent to daily clinical practice. We have seen rapid development of serological tests to identify the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but due to the lack of robustness of the available data, there is little evidence of their quality and diagnostic efficacy. The purpose of this discussion is to verify the possibility of a ""real life"" strategy in the management of SARS-CoV2 infection, through the integration of molecular and serological tests, to obtain indications on the best diagnostic algorithm to be applied, at the state of the art of recent knowledges.Copyright © 2020 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

0	The relationship between lymphocyte recovery, specific antibody level and 2019-nCoV reversion in convalescent patients with COVID-19. Objective: A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 patients to explore the correlations among lymphocytes, virus-specific antibodies (immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) reversion. Method(s): A total of 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Lu'an Hospital affiliated to Anhui Medical University from January 20, 2020 to March 3, 2020 were recruited. Throat swab specimens were collected and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for 2019-nCoV in 14 days post-discharge. Seven patients (mean age 36.3+/-5.8 years) experienced virus reversion were selected as reversion group, while the 62 remaining cases (mean age 44.4+/-11.5 years) were assigned to the recovery group. The parametric/non-parametric tests were applied to discriminate clinical features and total lymphocyte count (on admission and on discharge) between the two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the impact of lymphocyte on different stages of disease course in virus-reversion group. Specific antibody levels were compared by using nonparametric tests. Result(s): Virus reversion occurred at a rate of 10% (7/69). The reversion period took a median 8 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay, age, gender, history of smoking and/or drinking, coinfection and underlying disease (P>0.05). Total lymphocyte count in recovery group was significantly higher on discharge than on admission [(1.29+/-0.33)x109/L, (1.14+/-0.41)x109/L, respectively; t=-2.097, P=0.038], while there were no significant change in reactivation group [(1.48+/-0.51)x109/L, (1.54+/-0.74)x109/L, respectively; t=0.206, P=0.840]. Total lymphocyte count was significantly higher in reversion group than in recover group both on admission and at discharge (t=-2.552, P=0.016; t=-2.023, P=0.048). No apparent change was found in total lymphocyte count during the different stage of disease in reversion group [(1.54+/-0.74)x109/L, (1.48+/-0.51)x109/L, (1.64+/-0.33)x109/L, (1.57+/-0.31)x109/L, respectively; F=0.127, P=0.943]. There was no significant difference in levels of IgM [2.65(1.98, 3.45), 2.95(1.31, 4.51)], and IgG [4.61(4.01, 5.78), 4.56(2.50, 5.45)between the two groups (Z=-0.295, P=0.768;Z=-0.319, P=0.075), respectively. Conclusion(s): The immune systems of COVID-19 patients at high risk for virus reversion may respond lightly to the 2019-nCOV infection, leading to a prolonged virus presence after discharge.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	Infertility Treatment in COVID-19 Pandemic. The Coronavirus pandemic has had a great impact on various health sectors including pregnancy and infertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF), in utero insemination (IUI), ovulation-induction, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, and assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Due to the current situation in the COVID-19 pandemic and the relaxation permitted by the government, allowing nonessential services in a gradual manner, infertility services are being resumed according to the guidelines set by the ministry of health and family welfare. To meet the demands of current situation, the patient and the staff should be triaged. Only those patients should be undertaken who are tested or screened negative. Diagnostic evaluation is done using RT-PCR and the testing should be done at the commencement of treatment, that is, on day 2 of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle. Repeat test is done before the hCG trigger. The husband also needs testing at least once during the cycle, preferably at the start of the cycle. If the donor tests positive for COVID-19, the cycle should be cancelled. Universal good practices should be followed in laboratory also by each staff, which includes use of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) like eye protectors, FFP-2 or N-95 face masks, double gloves, shoe covers, disposable impermeable gowns, and face shields. The sanitization of the laboratory environment, equipment and devices should be done with appropriate nonembryotoxic disinfectants at the end of each procedure. COVID-19 has actually changed the way infertility treatment is being provided, keeping in view the safety of both the doctors and the patient.Copyright © 2020 Women in Cardiology and Related Sciences.	false
0	Coronavirus in Scotland: The effect of COVID-19 lockdown on admissions with chronic liver disease. Background: COVID-19 lockdown began in Scotland on 23rd March 2020. This was followed by a significant reduction in unselected medical admissions to Scottish hospitals with increased illness severity and in-patient mortality This study aimed to investigate the specific effect of lockdown on admissions with liver disease in Scotland Methods: Patients admitted to 7 major Scottish hospitals with chronic liver disease in April 2020 were identified and compared with admissions in April 2017, 2018 and 2019 (n=459) Data was collected on patient demographics and disease characteristics Socioeconomic deprivation was derived from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) in quintiles for analysis (1=most deprived; 5=least deprived) Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22 Results: The median age of the whole cohort was 58 years (IQR: 49-66) They were predominantly male (n=267; 58 2%) 204 (44 4%) were from the most deprived quintile of the population The median MELD was 16 (IQR: 12-21) 354 (77 1%) had alcoholic liver disease (ALD) as either the primary or a contributory factor to their disease Median length of stay was 7 days (IQR: 4-14) 46 patients died in hospital giving an inpatient mortality of 9 8% Table 1 outlines the comparisons between patients admitted in April 2020 (n=111) and the previous 3 years (n=348) No difference was seen in age (59 years vs 58; p=0 88) or gender (59 men (53 2%) vs 208 men (59 8%); p=0 22) Severity of liver disease on admission was similar (MELD 15 vs 16; p=0 68) Although serum sodium was reduced in the pre-COVID era group (135 (130-138), n=348) compared with the COVID-lockdown cohort (137 (132-140), n=111) (p=0.01) no significant differences were seen in other blood parameters Length of stay (7 days vs 8 days; p=0 093), inpatient mortality (8 3% vs 10 4%; p=0 51) and socioeconomic deprivation by SIMD (p=0 41) were not significantly different between the two cohorts. There was not a significant difference between the number of patients admitted in each year (poisson regression analysis p=0 37) Conclusion(s): The lockdown introduced to control the COVID pandemic in Scotland did not have a significant impact on the number, severity of liver disease at presentation or outcomes in patients admitted with chronic liver disease, in contrast with unselected medical admissions in the immediate post lockdown period(Table Presented).	false

Since January 2020 the infection by SARS-CoV-2, causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread worldwide as a pandemic starting from the city of Wuhan, China. Unlike Coronaviruses responsible for previous pandemics (SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV), SARSCoV- 2 spreads quickly and does not seem to reduce its virulence. Over 6 mo. over 15,000,000 people were infected and 600,000 deaths were recorded, mainly because of severe respiratory failure due to interstitial pneumonia. In Italy more than 240,000 symptomatic and asymptomatic infected subjects and about 35,000 deaths are reported. After a significant reduction of the individual contagious rate index, together with the drop in hospital admissions and deaths thanks to lockdown, an increase is expected in the coming months because of lowering of security measures and return of cold seasons. Pathophysiological knowledge is still limited. In particular, mechanisms triggering the most serious forms which can lead to the poor outcome are unclear. Numerous studies have shown changes in coagulation tests in patients with COVID-19, which ref lect a hypercoagulable state and thromboembolic risk, strongly related to clinical severity and mortality. Pulmonary and systemic thrombotic manifestations, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), have been observed and appear to significantly affect prognosis. In this hypercoagulable state, proven clinically and by laboratory tests, anticoagulants, such as low molecular weight heparin, appears effective. However, the dose is not clearly defined and is being evaluated in specifically designed clinical trials. Patients with haemophilia and congenital haemorrhagic diseases (CHD) exhibit a hypocoagulable state, which is corrected by replacement therapies, on demand or on prophylaxis regimens. These patients are carefully and regularly followed by specialist Centers, for bleeding and related or unrelated comorbidities. At present it is unknown at which extent the population of CHD patients has been involved in COVID-19 pandemic. The high incidence of thromboembolic complications in infected patients and treatment with anticoagulants at therapeutic or prophylactic dose represent challenges for patients with CHD. On the other hand, the inherited hypocoagulability could somehow limit thrombotic complications. Among discomforts of pandemic, possible shortage of plasma-derived and recombinant factor concentrates due to difficulties in international transport is feared. Particularly for plasma-derived products, there is a fear of a drastic reduction in blood donations. Reduced consumption of these concentrates is hypothesized due to the unjustified fear of virus transmission, as happened in the years of HIV and HCV infections. Clinical trials could provide useful information from an epidemiological and clinical point of view. In this respect, an observational multicentric cohort study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 in the Italian population of patients with CHD was designed on behalf of the Association of Italian Haemophilia Centres (AICE). This retrospective-prospective study will provide data on prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 in patients followed by the Italian AICE Centres, since the beginning of pandemic (february 2020) up to oneyear prospective follow-up.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was demonstrated in placenta; however, the data on the prevalence of placental infection and associated histopathology are limited. In order to identify the frequency and features of SARS-CoV-2 involvement we performed a clinicopathologic analysis of 75 placental cases from women infected at the time of delivery and 75 uninfected controls. Placental samples were studied with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization (ISH). Positive results were confirmed by electron microscopy (EM) and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). During delivery only one women had symptoms of COVID-19, six women reported previous symptoms, and 68 women were asymptomatic. All neonates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Obstetric histories were unremarkable in 29 of 75 positive and 8 of 75 negative women. Respectively, placental examination was normal in 12 of 75 infected and 3 of 75 uninfected subjects. In the remaining cases placental pathology correlated with obstetric comorbidities without significant differences between positive and negative women. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in one placenta of an infected, but asymptomatic parturient. Viral staining was predominantly localized to the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) which demonstrated marked damage accompanied by perivillous fibrin deposition and mixed intervillositis. A significant decrease of viral titers was detected in the attached umbilical cord comparing to the villous parenchyma by qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is seldom identified in placentas of infected women. Placental involvement by the virus is characterized by STB damage disrupting placental barrier and can be seen in asymptomatic mothers without evidence of vertical transmission. Copyright © 2020.

Relato: FSF, diagnostico mieloma multiplo IgG, indice prognostico internacional (ISS) II, Durie-Salmon III, em julho de 2020, antecendentes de diabetes, hipertensao arterial sistemica, coronariopatia, marca-passo e dislipidemia. Iniciou quimioterapia com bortezomibe e dexametasona em pulsos em 16 de julho. Apos 12 dias do inicio do tratamento apresentou quadro febril, tosse e dessaturacao, tomografia demonstrou lesoes em vidro fosco e exame de swab nasal por PCR foi positivo para Sars-CoV-2. Foi tratado conforme protocolo da instituicao recebendo antibioticoterapia, dexametasona e enoxaparina. No decimo dia da infeccao pelo Sars-CoV-2 apresentou dor toracica atipica de forte intensidade, com aumento progressivo das enzimas cardiacas e instabilidade hemodinamica, transferido para UTI, realizado cateterismo cardiaco que nao demonstrou lesoes coronarias, apenas prejuizo funcao cardiaca. Submetido a ressonancia magnetica cardiaca que demonstrou area inativa em parede inferior. Apresentou taquicardia ventricular e apos estabilizacao clinica foi submetido a novo cateterismo cardiaco, porem evoluiu com choque cardiogenico refratario e obito em 15/08/2020. Discussao: Evidencias apontam que a infeccao por coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) em pacientes com doencas hematologicas malignas esta associada a quadros mais severos, com mais chance de desenvolverem a forma fatal. Associa-se esse quadro ao tratamento imunossupressor, alem da disfuncao imune que a neoplasia em si causa, sendo que o aumento da letalidade desses pacientes pode estar relacionado a co-infeccao com bacterias. Entretanto, varios fatores confundidores se associam, como o fato de que muitos pacientes onco hematologicos apresentam comorbidades associadas, como hipertensao, idade avancada, obesidade e doencas cardiovasculares, que sao fatores de risco conhecidos por agravar o quadro de infeccao por Sars-CoV-2. Em cardiopatas e hipertensos, e frequente a elevacao de enzimas cardiacas relacionadas a casos severos de COVID-19, que pode estar associado a miocardites, isquemia e arritmias. Alem disso, pacientes com mieloma multiplo sao de 7 a 10 vezes mais susceptiveis a infeccoes bacterianas e virais, sendo que o seu tratamento leva a deficiencia imune humoral, hipogamaglobulinemia e prejuizo na resposta de celulas-B. Em caso de infeccao sintomatica por COVID-19, o tratamento anti-mieloma deve ser suspenso ate recuperacao. Conclusao: As altas taxas de hospitalizacoes de pacientes onco hematologicos devido a periodicidade de seu tratamento podem aumentar a chance de infeccoes nosocomiais por COVID-19. Portanto, o ideal seria adiar o tratamento especifico para a doenca de base quando possivel e tomar medidas de precaucao especiais para o isolamento desses pacientes no ambiente hospitalar alem de orientar medidas de isolamento domiciliar. E importante fazer o diagnostico diferencial de outras infeccoes microbiologicas nesses pacientes, que podem apresentar quadros clinicos semelhantes. Alem disso, e necessario uma monitorizacao proxima para complicacoes relacionadas ao COVID-19, ja que a intervencao precoce e uma das principais ferramentas para controle da morbimortalidade, haja vista a falta de estrategias terapeuticas disponiveis contra a doenca.Copyright © 2020	false
0	IMPACTO DA PANDEMIA POR CORONAVIRUS NO INDICE DE RECUSA NA TRIAGEM CLINICA NO INSTITUTO DE HEMATOLOGIA E HEMOTERAPIA DE BELEM - IHEBE. Introducao: O IHEBE e um servico de hemoterapia privado, localizado em Belem/Para, que recebe media de 15.500 doacoes anuais. Todavia, sao considerados inaptos na triagem clinica cerca de 2.500 doadores/ano, destes. Objetivo: Verificar a incidencia de recusa na triagem clinica por Coronavirus atraves de diagnostico ou sintomatologia ou contato com pessoas confirmadas no mesmo periodo ou viajem para areas com casos da COVID-19 e avaliar o impacto transfusional atraves da inaptidao por este motivo. Material e metodos: Estudo transversal, descritivo, realizado no IHEBE no periodo de 01/03/2020 a 31/07/2020. Foram selecionados todos os doadores considerados inaptos que compareceram ao IHEBE neste periodo. Os dados foram obtidos pelo sistema RealBlood e tabulados em planilhas do programa Microsoft Office Excel 2013. Resultados: Dos 5.620 doadores que compareceram neste periodo, 919 foram considerados inaptos na triagem clinica, sendo o Coronavirus o motivo de 8,05% das recusas. Entre os 74 inaptos, 3,92% (n=36) doadores apresentaram diagnostico confirmado de Coronavirus e 4,13% (n=38) doadores haviam viajado para areas com casos de Covid ou tiveram contato com pessoas confirmadas pela infeccao. Discussao: Considerando os motivos de inaptidao na triagem clinica, a hemoglobina baixa e o principal motivo de recusa (n=182; 19,80%), seguido do comportamento de risco (n=97; 10,55%) e doador que apresenta algum problema de saude (n=91; 9,90%). A pandemia por Coronavirus foi o 4degree principal motivo significativo de recusa, sendo 36,49% (n=27) em individuos do genero feminino e 63,51% (n=47) em individuos do genero masculino, de acordo com maioria dos estudos em que o genero masculino ainda e o maior publico para doacao de sangue. Conclusao: Apesar da criticidade do periodo pandemico nao foi observado diferenca significativa no total de inaptidao clinica quando comparado ao mesmo periodo do ano anterior, 2019 (n=952) e 2020 (n=919). Contudo, foi tracado de estrategias de captacao para este cenario que garantiram a estabilidade do estoque mantendo o numero de doacoes de 2019 (n=5.645) e 2020 (n=5.620). Entretanto, como e de se esperar para periodos de pandemia e por recomendacao da OMS e politicas locais, foram adotados diversos procedimentos que gerariam impacto transfusional, porem se observou discreta reducao do numero de transfusoes (-2,3%) de 2019 (7.504) para 2020 (7.335 transfusoes), referente ao mesmo periodo.Copyright © 2020	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Saliva Rises Gradually and to Moderate Levels in Some Humans. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings often occurs before symptom onset, therefore testing strategies that can reliably detect people in the early phase of infection are urgently needed. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially critical to protect vulnerable populations who require frequent interactions with caretakers. Rapid COVID-19 tests have been proposed as an attractive strategy for surveillance, however a limitation of most rapid tests is their low sensitivity. Low-sensitivity tests are comparable to high sensitivity tests in detecting early infections when two assumptions are met: (1) viral load rises quickly (within hours) after infection and (2) viral load reaches and sustains high levels (>10 5 - 10 6 RNA copies/mL). However, there are no human data testing these assumptions. In this study, we document a case of presymptomatic household transmission from a healthy young adult to a sibling and a parent. Participants prospectively provided twice-daily saliva samples. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR and we measured the complete viral load profiles throughout the course of infection of the sibling and parent. This study provides evidence that in at least some human cases of SARS-CoV-2, viral load rises slowly (over days, not hours) and not to such high levels to be detectable reliably by any low-sensitivity test. Additional viral load profiles from different samples types across a broad demographic must be obtained to describe the early phase of infection and determine which testing strategies will be most effective for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection before transmission can occur., One sentence summary: In some human infections, SARS-CoV-2 viral load rises slowly (over days) and remains near the limit of detection of rapid, low-sensitivity tests.	false
0	Asymptomatic COVID-19 with ambiguous test results. BACKGROUND: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Mass testing of healthy individuals raises several issues, however, and the results can be challenging to interpret., CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 19-year-old man entered the military after two weeks of quarantine. The recruit had no respiratory symptoms or fever before, during or after his enrolment, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At enrolment, he had a positive rapid test and a venous blood sample showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests of specimens obtained from the upper respiratory tract were negative at enrolment and at week three, but were positive at week six., INTERPRETATION: The overall assessment of all the tests indicates a probable asymptomatic infection. This case report illustrates the challenge of interpreting screening results in asymptomatic individuals.	false
0	Epidemiological characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou. Objective To understand the epidemiological characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou and provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of the disease. Methods The data of imported COVID-19 in Guangzhou reported as of April 1, 2020 were collected from National Notifiable Disease Report System of China. The software Excel 2010 and SPSS 19.0 were applied for data cleaning and statistical analysis. Results As of April 1, 2020, a total of 103 imported COVID-19 cases had been reported in Guangzhou, in which 92 were confirmed cases and 11 were asymptomatic infection cases. The number of the confirmed imported cases accounted for 11.4% (92/806) in of the total in China at the same time. The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.58: 1 (63: 40). The median age of the cases was 31 years (p25-P75:22-40 years), range of age was 11-63 years. The main occupational distributions of the cases were business services (41/103, 39.8%) and students (36/103, 35.0%). The imported cases whose destinations were 19 provinces and municipalities rather than Guangdong after entering the country accounted for 43.7%. The main source countries of infections were the United Kingdom (27/103, 26.2%), the Philippines (13/103, 12.6%), the United States (13/103, 12.6%) and Nigeria (7/103, 6.8%). There were 34 inbound flights from which the imported COVID-19 cases were detected, in which 10 flights (10/34, 29.4%) were found to carry more than 3 cases, with an average voyage time of (11.14 +/- 0.53) hours. A total of 29 imported cases (28.2%) showed symptoms before entering the country, and 65 cases (63.1%) had been isolated before the onset of the disease. The mean free activity time of the isolated cases after the onset was (6.76 + 0.79) days. The average number of the imported cases' close contacts was 53. There were 13 clusters of COVID-19 caused by the imported cases, involving 36 cases (including 1 imported associated case). Conclusions The sources of the imported COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou were widely distributed, and no cases had been found to be infected on the flights. In the early stage of the imported epidemic, there was high risk for the spread of the epidemic. Strengthened prevention and control of imported COVID-19 effectively reduced the of transmission risk of COVID-19 in communities.Copyright © 2020 Chinese Medical Association.

0	Performance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Real-Time RT-PCR Tests on Oral Rinses and Saliva Samples. Access to rapid and accurate detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is essential for controlling the current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. In this study, the use of oral rinses (ORs) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva as an alternative to swab collection methods from symptomatic and asymptomatic health care workers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR was evaluated. For saliva samples, the overall agreement with oropharyngeal swabs was 93% (K = 0.84), with a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3%-99.8%). The agreement between saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs was 97.7% (K = 0.93), with a sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI, 73.0%-99.7%). ORs were compared with nasopharyngeal swabs only, with an overall agreement of 85.7% (K = 0.65), and a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 46.6%-77.8%). The agreement between a laboratory-developed test based on the CDC RT-PCR and two commercial assays, the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and the Cobas SARS-CoV-2, was also evaluated. The overall agreement was >90%. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples was shown to be stable, with no changes in viral loads over 24 hours at both room temperature and 4degreeC. Although the dilution of SARS-CoV-2 in ORs precluded its acceptability as a sample type, posterior oropharyngeal saliva was an acceptable alternative sample type for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.Copyright © 2020 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology	false
0	Covid-19 and blood groups: ABO antibody levels may also matter. BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to Covid-19 has been found to be associated with ABO blood group, with O type individuals being at a lower risk. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that Covid-19 patients might have lower levels of ABO antibodies than non-infected individuals as they could offer some degree of protection., METHODS: After showing that the viral spike protein harbors the ABO glycan epitopes when produced by cells expressing the relevant glycosyltransferases, like upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, we enrolled 290 patients with Covid-19 and 276 asymptomatic controls to compare their levels of natural ABO blood group antibodies., RESULTS: We found significantly lower IgM anti-A+ anti-B agglutination scores in blood group O patients (76.93 vs 88.29, P-value = 0.034) and lower levels of anti-B (24.93 vs 30.40, P-value = 0.028) and anti-A antibodies (28.56 vs 36.50, P-value = 0.048) in blood group A and blood group B patients, respectively, compared to controls., CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that ABO antibodies levels are significantly lower in Covid-19 patients compared to controls. These findings could indicate that patients with low levels of ABO antibodies are at higher risk of being infected. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: Clinical features and management-intensive care experience from a pediatric public hospital in western india. Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (MIS-C) in children is being increasingly reported across the world. Material(s) and Method(s): Children fulfilling World Health Organization criteria of MIS-C needing pediatric intensive care unit between April 15 and July 26, 2020 were studied. Result(s): There were 21 patients with median age of 7 year [interquartile range (IQR) 1.9-12.1] of which 11 were females. SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction positive in 8/21 and/or antibody positive 16/21. Fever was present in all patients, and gastrointestinal symptoms being second most frequent (16/21). One child had aplastic anemia, while the rest had no comorbidities. Nearly all presented with shock (n = 20/21) and 90% needed vasoactive drugs with a median Vasoactive Inotropic Score of 40 (IQR 20-95). Thirteen children needed ventilatory support and one needed peritoneal dialysis. Nine children had left ventricular dysfunction and five had dilatation of coronaries on echocardiography. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein [98 mg/dL (IQR 89-119)], serum ferritin [710 mg/dL (IQR 422-1,609)], and serum interleukin-6 levels [215 ng/L (IQR 43-527)] were uniformly elevated. Eighteen children received pulse methyl-prednisolone, eleven intravenous immunoglobulins, and four tocilizumab. Eighteen children (86%) were discharged home while three died. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, MIS-C was seen in previously healthy children with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and shock. Early and aggressive management of shock and immune modulation with methyl-prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin were used.Copyright © The Author(s). 2020.	false
0	Venous thrombotic complications in cancer patients with SARS-CoV- 2 Infection: Report from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) Registry Analysis. Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Patients with COVID-19, especially those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), are also reported to have increased risk of VTE. Data investigating VTE in patients with both cancer and COVID-19 are limited. Aim(s): The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) (NCT04354701) international cohort study aimed to investigate the clinical course and complications of SARS-CoV- 2 in patients with cancer. Method(s): Chart review was used to identify endpoints including incident VTE stratified by high risk subgroups, initial COVID-19 severity, and cancer treatment status. Result(s): From March 17, 2020 to May 16, 2020, 2199 patients were accrued with 58% of patients greater than 2-weeks follow- up. Median age was 67 (18-89) and 50.5% were men. While all COVID-19 patients had current or past history of cancer (1741 solid; 458 hematologic), only 55% received anti-cancer therapy in preceding 3 months. Initial COVID-19 severity was mild (outpatient), moderate (hospitalization), and severe (ICU) in 42%, 43%, and 12% of patients, respectively, with 3% unknown. VTE complications occurred in 3.5% of all patients. Among these, 1.3% (12/931), 4.2% (39/936), and 10.0% (26/260) occurred in outpatient, non-ICU hospitalization, and intensive care setting, respectively. Furthermore, VTE was more frequent in patients receiving any recent anti-cancer therapy than those without (5.2% vs. 2.2%) and in patients with progressive disease compared to those in remission/NED (7.1% vs 2.0%). The results reported here are likely an underestimate of true incidence given limited follow-up to date. Data collection is currently ongoing; a detailed assessment of pre-specified cancer subgroups with increased susceptibility for VTE will be presented. Continued follow-up assessment is required for formal VTE risk prediction. Conclusion(s): Our study is the largest cancer cohort to date describing the incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Results will inform global thrombosis care in this population.	false
0	Retinal microvascular abnormalities in patients after COVID-19 depending on disease severity. BACKGROUND: Global pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a prothrombotic state without fully elucidated effects. This study aims to analyse and quantify the possible retinal microvascular abnormalities., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case-control study. Patients between 18 and 55 years old with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 3 months were included. Risk stratification: group 1-mild disease (asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic); group 2-moderate disease (required hospital admission with no acute respiratory distress) and group 3-severe disease (subjects who developed an acute respiratory distress were admitted in the intensive care unit and presented interleukin 6 values above 40 pg/mL). Age-matched volunteers with negative serology tests were enrolled to control group. A colour photograph, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and an angiography using OCT centred on the fovea were performed., RESULTS: Control group included 27 subjects: group 1 included 24 patients, group 2 consisted of 24 patients and 21 participants were recruited for group 3. There were no funduscopic lesions, neither in the colour images nor in the structural OCT. Fovea-centred vascular density (VD) was reduced in group 2 and group 3 compared with group 1 and control group (control group vs group 2; 16.92 vs 13.37; p=0.009) (control group vs group 3; 16.92 vs .13.63; p=0.026) (group 1 vs group 2; 17.16 vs 13.37; p=0.006) (group 1 vs group 3; 17.16 vs 13.63 p=0.017)., CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had decreased central retinal VD as compared with that of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic cases or control subjects.

In Brazil, the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in February 2020, and since then, the number of cases and deaths has increased exponentially, reaching 2.610.102 confirmed cases and 91.263 deaths on July 31st. Most people have a mild to moderate respiratory illness, but the clinical evolution may be severe in older adults and patients with comorbidities, such as cancer. There are few reports of COVID-19 in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This ongoing study aims to collect data about COVID-19 in CML patients from Brazil and their outcomes. Method(s): This is an observational, multicentric, ongoing register study. Hematologists from private and public CML reference centers from different regions of Brazil were invited to report their cases of COVID-19 in CML patients. Altogether, those centers are responsible for the care of approximately 4336 CML patients. Result(s): Between March and July 2020, 24 institutions contributed to this analysis, and reported 28 COVID-19 cases in CML patients. Eighteen centers were from the South and Southeast regions, 5 from Northeast, and one from the Central region. There were 19 cases (67.9%) from the Southeast region, 8 (28.6%) from the Northeast, one from South (3.6%). The median age was 54 years (24-79), with 13 (44%) older than 60. Male patients were predominant (67.9%). There was one patient in the accelerated phase. There were two cases of COVID-19 simultaneous to CML diagnosis, 10 using imatinib, 7 dasatinib, 6 nilotinib, one ponatinib, one asciminib, and one patient in treatment-free remission after imatinib discontinuation. The median time of CML diagnosis was 7.0 years (0-26). Current CML response was: no hematologic response (n=8), hematologic response (n = 4), major molecular response (n = 9), MR4.0 or MR5.0 (n= 7). Eleven patients interrupted treatment temporarily during COVID-19. COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR of oral and nasal swab collection (20) or serologic test (07). One case is suspect, awaiting confirmation. The majority of the patients presented at least one comorbidity (60%): hypertension (7), diabetes (3), chronic renal failure (1), dyslipidemia (2), arterial disease (2), cirrhosis (1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema (2), pulmonary hypertension (1), HTLV1 (1), obesity (n=1). COVID-19 severity: mild/moderate (19), severe/critic (9). Five out of 9 (55%) of the severe/critic cases were older than 60, 4/9 presented comorbidities and 5/9 (55%) had no major molecular response (MMR)(one was in accelerated phase, one newly diagnosed, and 3 with only hematologic response). Among the mild/moderate cases, 12/19 had optimal response (63%) and 7/19 (36%) had no hematologic response. Twenty-one patients recovered, 4 are still hospitalized, and 3 died from COVID: one newly diagnosed case with high leukocytes counts and with a simultaneous bacterial infection, one elderly patient with comorbidities treated with imatinib and one patient treated with nilotinib, with hematologic response. A fourth patient in the accelerated phase died 2 months after discharge, from disease progression and pulmonary infection. Conclusion(s): Although the sample size is still small to make conclusions regarding COVID-19 behavior in CML patients, the most severe cases occurred in patients not in MMR. The continued register of the cases will increase our knowledge about this disease and how to manage these patients.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Prevalence and risk factor assessment of digital eye strain among children using online e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: Digital eye strain among kids (DESK study-1). Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine prevalence, symptoms frequency and associated risk factors of digital eye strain (DES) among children attending online classes during COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: The online electronic survey form was prepared on the Google app. Children/parents were asked to indicate the total duration of digital device use before and during COVID era. The symptoms of DES, its severity and frequency were recorded & measured with the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire., Results: Two hundred and sixty one parents responded to the questionnaire, of these 217 were complete. Mean age of children was 13 +/- 2.45 years. Mean duration of digital device used during COVID era was 3.9 +/- 1.9 h which is more than pre COVID era (1.9 +/- 1.1 h, P = <0.0001). 36.9% (n = 80) were using digital devices >5 h in COVID era as compared to 1.8% (n = 4) before COVID era. The most common digital device used were smartphones (n = 134, 61.7%). One hundred and eight children (49.8%) were attending online classes for >2 h per day. Prevalence of DES in our cohort is 50.23% (109/217). Of these 26.3% were mild, 12.9% moderate and 11.1% of severe grade. Most common symptoms were itching and headache (n = 117, 53.9%). Multivariate analysis revealed age >14 years (P = 0.04), male gender (P = 0.0004), smartphone use (P = 0.003), use of device >5 h (P = 0.0007) and mobile games >1 h/day (P = 0.0001) as independent risk factors for DES in children., Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of DES among children in COVID era. Parents should be considerate about duration, type and distance of digital device use to avoid DES symptoms in children.	false
0	Towards an accurate and systematic characterisation of persistently asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. People with persistently asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection experience no symptoms throughout the course of infection, and pre-symptomatic individuals become infectious days before they report symptoms. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals without symptoms contributes to pandemic spread, but the extent of transmission from persistently asymptomatic individuals remains unknown. We describe three methodological issues that hinder attempts to estimate this proportion. First, incomplete symptom assessment probably overestimates the asymptomatic fraction. Second, studies with inadequate follow-up misclassify pre-symptomatic individuals. Third, serological studies might identify people with previously unrecognised infection, but reliance on poorly defined antibody responses and retrospective symptom assessment might result in misclassification. We provide recommendations regarding definitions, detection, documentation, and follow-up to improve the identification and evaluation of people with persistently asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their contacts. Accurate characterisation of the persistently asymptomatic fraction of infected individuals might shed light on COVID-19 pathogenesis and transmission dynamics, and inform public health responses.

0	Is COVID-19 Associated With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms., RESULTS: 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit. Future studies should assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients' mental health. © Copyright 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.	false
0	Evaluation of lockdown effect on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics through viral genome quantification in waste water, Greater Paris, France, 5 March to 23 April 2020. IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms; thus, they may contribute to silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in waste water (WW) has been proposed as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations.AimTo test if the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW correlates with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. MethodWe performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw WW samples collected from several major WW treatment plants in Greater Paris. The study period was 5 March to 23 April 2020, including the lockdown period in France (from 17 March). Results We showed that the increase of genome units in raw WW accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genome could be detected before the epidemic grew massively (around 8 March). Equally importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genome units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases, 29 days following the lockdown. Conclusion This work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW could generate important additional information for improved monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at local or regional levels and emphasises the role of WW-based epidemiology.	false
0	Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Weather-Induced Seasonal Virulence from Atmospheric Air Enthalpy. Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have examined the possibility of correlating the virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, to the climatic conditions of the involved sites; however, inconclusive results have been generally obtained. Although neither air temperature nor humidity can be independently correlated with virus viability, a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the specific enthalpy of moist air appears to exist, as confirmed by extensive data analysis. Given this framework, the present study involves a detailed investigation based on the first 20-30 days of the epidemic before public health interventions in 30 selected Italian provinces with rather different climates, here assumed as being representative of what happened in the country from North to South, of the relationship between COVID-19 distributions and the climatic conditions recorded at each site before the pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, a correlating equation between the incidence rate at the early stage of the epidemic and the foregoing average specific enthalpy of atmospheric air was developed, and an enthalpy-based seasonal virulence risk scale was proposed to predict the potential danger of COVID-19 outbreak due to the persistence of weather conditions favorable to SARS-CoV-2 viability. As an early detection tool, an unambiguous risk chart expressed in terms of coupled temperatures and relative humidity (RH) values was provided, showing that safer conditions occur in the case of higher RHs at the highest temperatures, and of lower RHs at the lowest temperatures. Despite the complex determinism and dynamics of the pandemic and the related caveats, the restriction of the study to its early stage allowed the proposed risk scale to result in agreement with the available infectivity data highlighted in the literature for a number of cities around the world.	false
0	Mental Health Status of University Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Post-Movement Lockdown Assessment. This study investigated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and determined the association between various factors, social support, and depression, anxiety, and stress among university healthcare workers in Malaysia after the government lifted the movement control order (MCO) put in place to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remained elevated even after the MCO was lifted.	false
0	"Transmissibility of COVID-19 depends on the viral load around onset in adult and symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between viral load and secondary transmission in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from immunocompetent laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to and/or from whom viral loads were measured at Toyama University Hospital. Using a case-control approach, index patients who transmitted the disease to at least one other patient were analysed as ""cases"" (index patients) compared with patients who were not the cause of secondary transmission (non-index patients, analysed as ""controls""). The viral load time courses were assessed between the index and non-index symptomatic patients using non-linear regression employing a standard one-phase decay model., RESULTS: In total, 28 patients were included in the analysis. Median viral load at the initial sample collection was significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients and in adults than in children. Among symptomatic patients (n = 18), non-linear regression models showed that the estimated viral load at onset was higher in the index than in the non-index patients (median [95% confidence interval]: 6.6 [5.2-8.2] vs. 3.1 [1.5-4.8] log copies/muL, respectively). In adult (symptomatic and asymptomatic) patients (n = 21), median viral load at the initial sample collection was significantly higher in the index than in the non-index patients (p = 0.015, 3.3 vs. 1.8 log copies/muL, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: High nasopharyngeal viral loads around onset may contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19. Viral load may help provide a better understanding of why transmission is observed in some instances, but not in others, especially among household contacts."	false
0	Effect of Psychological-Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients. The COVID-19 epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health stress. In this study, we explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent depression and anxiety assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social support level was also evaluated by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at admission. Results showed that gender, age, oxygen saturation, and social support were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. In addition, age, family infection with SARS-CoV-2, and social support were the risk factors associated with depression. Moreover, we designed a psychological-behavioral intervention (PBI) program that included psychological support and breathing exercises, and explored its effects on patients with COVID-19. Of the 144 participants, 26 patients with both anxiety and depression symptoms (cutoff score of >=8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. After 10-day treatment, the HADS scores of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the intervention group, and PSSS scores were also significantly improved. However, no significant differences in HADS and PSSS scores between pre- and post-treatment were found in the control group. Our findings indicate that mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for COVID-19 patients.

0	Invisible epidemics: ethics and asymptomatic infection. Interactions between microbes and human hosts can lead to a wide variety of possible outcomes including benefits to the host, asymptomatic infection, disease (which can be more or less severe), and/or death. Whether or not they themselves eventually develop disease, asymptomatic carriers can often transmit disease-causing pathogens to others. This phenomenon has a range of ethical implications for clinical medicine, public health, and infectious disease research. The implications of asymptomatic infection are especially significant in situations where, and/or to the extent that, the microbe in question is transmissible, potentially harmful, and/or untreatable. This article reviews the history and concept of asymptomatic infection, and relevant ethical issues associated with this phenomenon. It illustrates the role and ethical significance of asymptomatic infection in outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics-including recent crises involving drug resistance, Zika, and Covid19. Serving as the Introduction to this Special Issue of Monash Bioethics Review, it also provides brief summaries of the other articles comprising this collection.	false
0	Dynamics and Correlation Among Viral Positivity, Seroconversion, and Disease Severity in COVID-19 : A Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND: The understanding of viral positivity and seroconversion during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited., OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and evaluate their correlations with seroconversion and disease severity., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: 3 designated specialty care centers for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China., PARTICIPANTS: 3192 adult patients with COVID-19., MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data., RESULTS: Among 12 780 reverse transcriptase PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that were done, 24.0% had positive results. In 2142 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the viral positivity rate peaked within the first 3 days. The median duration of viral positivity was 24.0 days (95% CI, 18.9 to 29.1 days) in critically ill patients and 18.0 days (CI, 16.8 to 19.1 days) in noncritically ill patients. Being critically ill was an independent risk factor for longer viral positivity (hazard ratio, 0.700 [CI, 0.595 to 0.824]; P < 0.001). In patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the IgM-positive rate was 19.3% in the first week, peaked in the fifth week (81.5%), and then decreased steadily to around 55% within 9 to 10 weeks. The IgG-positive rate was 44.6% in the first week, reached 93.3% in the fourth week, and then remained high. Similar antibody responses were seen in clinically diagnosed cases. Serum inflammatory markers remained higher in critically ill patients. Among noncritically ill patients, a higher proportion of those with persistent viral positivity had low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) during the entire course compared with those with short viral positivity., LIMITATION: Retrospective study and irregular viral and serology testing., CONCLUSION: The rate of viral PCR positivity peaked within the initial few days. Seroconversion rates peaked within 4 to 5 weeks. Dynamic laboratory index changes corresponded well to clinical signs, the recovery process, and disease severity. Low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) are an independent risk factor for persistent viral positivity., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.	false
0	Assessment of serological techniques for screening patients for COVID-19 (COVID-SER): a prospective, multicentric study. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 threatens global public health, and there is an urgent public health need to assess acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests might provide results that can be complementary to or confirm suspected COVID-19 cases and reveal previous infection. The performance of serological assays (sensitivity and specificity) has to be evaluated before their use in the general population. The neutralisation capacity of the produced antibodies also has to be evaluated., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We set up a prospective, multicentric clinical study to evaluate the performance of serological kits among a population of healthcare workers presenting mild symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four hundred symptomatic healthcare workers will be included in the COVID-SER study. The values obtained from a control cohort included during the prepandemic time will be used as reference. A workflow was set up to study serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate antibody neutralisation capacity in patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests will be assessed using molecular detection of the virus as a reference. The measurement of IgM and IgG antibodies will be performed once per week for 6 consecutive weeks and then at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after the diagnosis. The kinetics of IgM and IgG will determine the optimal period to perform serological testing. The proportion of false negative PCR tests in symptomatic subjects will be determined on the basis of subsequent seroconversions., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the national review board for biomedical research in April 2020 (Comite de Protection des Personnes Sud Mediterranee I, Marseille, France) (ID RCB 2020-A00932-37).

0	Multi-center nationwide comparison of seven serology assays reveals a SARS-CoV-2 non-responding seronegative subpopulation. Background: An Israeli national taskforce performed a multi-center clinical and analytical validation of seven serology assays to determine their utility and limitations for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis., Methods: Serology assays from Roche, Abbott, Diasorin, BioMerieux, Beckman-Coulter, Siemens, and Mt.-Sinai ELISA were included. Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population, and 698 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, collected between March and May 2020, were analyzed., Findings: Immunoassays sensitivities between 81.5%-89.4% and specificities between 97.7%-100% resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in low (<15%) prevalence scenarios. No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults. A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers, and no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed. We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies., Interpretation: wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit significant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios. The low false-positivity rate in under 20's suggests that cross-reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children. Finding no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks is in contrast to some reports of short half-life for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The ~5% who were seronegative non-responders, using multiple assays in a population-wide manner, represents the proportion of patients that may be at risk for re-infection., Funding: Israel Ministry of Health.

0	Levels of Soluble CD14 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and 2 may be predictive of death in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). People infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) display a wide range of illness, from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress resulting in death. We measured serum biomarkers in uninfected individuals and in individuals with mild, moderate, or critical COVID-19 disease. Levels of monocyte activation (sCD14 and FABP4) and inflammation (TNFR1 and 2) were increased in COVID-19 individuals, regardless of disease severity. Among patients with critical disease, individuals who recovered from COVID-19 had lower levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 at hospital admission compared to these levels in patients with critical disease that ultimately died.

0	Rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the fluorescence detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate nucleic acid detection at the point of care. Here, we report an amplification-free nucleic acid immunoassay, implemented on a lateral flow strip, for the fluorescence detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in less than one hour. The assay uses DNA probes that are designed to bind to the conserved open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), envelope protein (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and a fluorescent-nanoparticle-labelled monoclonal antibody that binds to double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids. In a multi-hospital randomized double-blind trial involving 734 samples (593 throat swabs and 141 sputum) provided by 670 individuals, the assay achieved sensitivities of 100% and specificities of 99% for both types of sample (ground truth was determined using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription). The inexpensive amplification-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should facilitate the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 at the point of care.	false
0	Going to war with COVID-19: Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 management in the Padua Nephrology and Dialysis Unit's hemodialysis facility. BACKGROUND: The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a global health emergency, and dialysis patients are a high-risk population. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital., RESULTS: The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths., CONCLUSION: We attribute the low COVID-19 incidence noted so far for patients in our hemodialysis facilities to the early detection and prompt isolation of suspected patients per our specific plan along with the prompt application of preventive measures.	false
0	Waitlisted Transplant Candidates' Attitudes and Concerns Toward Transplantation During COVID-19. BACKGROUND In solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can contribute to a severe clinical course and an increased risk of death. Thus, patients awaiting a SOT or HSCT face the dilemma of choosing between a life-saving treatment that presents a significant threat of COVID-19 and the risk of waitlist dropout, progression of disease, or mortality. The lack of established literature on COVID-19 complicates the issue as patients, particularly those with inadequate health literacy, may not have the resources needed to navigate these decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a standardized phone survey of patients awaiting SOT or HSCT to assess the prevalence of inadequate health literacy and attitudes toward transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Seventy-one patients completed the survey, with a response rate of 84.5%. Regardless of health literacy, most waitlisted candidates recognized that the current pandemic is a serious situation affecting their care and that COVID-19 poses a significant risk to their health. Despite the increased risks, most patients reported they would choose immediate transplantation if there was no foreseeable end to the pandemic, and especially if the medical urgency did not permit further delay. There were no differences in responses across the patient waitlist groups for heart, kidney, liver, and stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS These findings can help transplant centers decide how transplantation services should proceed during this pandemic and can be used to educate patients and guide discussions about informed consent for transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality associated with COVID-19 in elderly patients from a long-term care facility. Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread from China all over the world and many COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities (LCTF). However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24/50 (57.1%) patients were males. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. At Cox regression analysis, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count < 1000 cells/microL (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Given the small population size as major limitation of our study, further investigations are necessary to better understand and confirm our findings in elderly patients.	false
0	Multimorbidity and population at risk for severe COVID-19 in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. This study aimed to measure the occurrence of multimorbidity and to estimate the number of individuals in the Brazilian population 50 years or older at risk for severe COVID-19. This was a cross-sectional nationwide study based on data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted in 2015-2016, with 9,412 individuals 50 years or older. Multimorbidity was defined as >= 2 chronic conditions based on a list of 15 diseases considered risk conditions for severe COVID-19. The analyses included calculation of prevalence and estimation of the absolute number of persons in the population at risk. Self-rated health status, frailty, and basic activities of daily living were used as markers of health status. Sex, age, region of the country, and schooling were used as covariables. Some 80% of the sample had at least one of the target conditions, which represents some 34 million individuals. Multimorbidity was reported by 52% of the study population, with higher proportions in the Central, Southeast, and South of Brazil. Cardiovascular diseases and obesity were the most frequent chronic conditions. An estimated 2.4 million Brazilians are at serious health risk. The results revealed inequalities according to schooling. The number of persons 50 years or older who presented risk conditions for severe COVID-19 is high both in absolute and relative terms. The estimate is important for planning strategies to monitor persons with chronic conditions and for preventive strategies to deal with the novel coronavirus.	false

0	Covid-19-endothelial axis and coronary artery bypass graft patency: A target for therapeutic intervention?. It has been reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces endothelial inflammation, therefore facilitating the progression of endothelial and vascular dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involves mainly the use of the saphenous vein (SV) and internal mammary artery as graft material in the stenosed coronary arteries. Unfortunately, graft patency of the SV is low due to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 might cause vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis in coronary artery bypass graft vessels by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Therefore, in this Special Article, we consider the potential influence of COVID-19 on the patency rates of coronary artery bypass graft vessels, mainly with reference to the SV. Moreover, we discuss the technique of SV graft harvesting and the therapeutic potential of focusing on endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and thrombosis for protecting coronary artery bypass grafts in COVID-19 infected CABG patients.Copyright © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular.

0	Can rituximab be used in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris during the COVID-19 pandemic?. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a B-lymphocyte antigen; that leads to a decline in the B-cell counts for at least a year. The patients who have received rituximab treatment in the previous 5 years with the diagnosis of pemphigus group of diseases at Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty were questioned for COVID-19 infection. A total of 48 patients were included in this study; only one male patient had COVID-19 infection which had a mild course. There is no significant difference in the total number of lymphocytes between patients who have received rituximab within the previous 5 years or last year. The number of lymphocytes is independent of the number of courses of rituximab treatment received. Therefore, we suggest that all pemphigus patients who have received rituximab treatment within the previous 5 years should be careful of the preventive measures against the COVID-19 infection irrespective of the number of treatment courses or the number of years which has passed since the treatment. The disease course was mild in the only infected patient. Thus, rituximab may be used in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris during the COVID-19 pandemic if its use is necessary.

0	Jobs, Housing and Mask-Wearing: A Cross-Sectional Study of Risk Factors for COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Many studies have focused on characteristics of symptomatic COVID-19 patients and clinical risk factors. This study reports prevalence of COVID-19 in an asymptomatic population of a hospital service area (HSA) and identifies factors that affect exposure to the virus., OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of COVID-19 in a HSA; identify factors that may increase or decrease the risk of infection; and to analyze factors that increase the number of daily contacts., METHODS: This study collected survey information from 1,694 patients between April 30th and May 13th, 2020, relating to work and living situations, income, behavior, socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic health characteristics. This data was linked to testing data for 454 of these patients gathered including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and two different serologic assays. Positivity rate was used to calculate approximate prevalence, hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate (IFR). Survey data was used to analyze risk factors, including the number of contacts reported by study participants. The data was also used to identify factors increasing the number of daily contacts, such as mask wearing and living environment., RESULTS: We found a positivity rate of 2.2 percent, a hospitalization rate of 1.2 percent and an adjusted IFR of 0.55 percent. Number of daily contacts with adults and seniors increases the probability of becoming infected. Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased the number of daily contacts., CONCLUSIONS: Studying the prevalence in an asymptomatic population revealed estimates of unreported COVID-19 cases. Occupational, living-situation, and behavioral data about COVID-19 protective behaviors such as mask wearing may aid in the identification of non-clinical factors affecting the number of daily contacts which may increase SARS-CoV-2 exposure.	false

BACKGROUND: Ascertaining preferences for SARS-CoV-2 testing and incorporating findings into the design and implementation of strategies for delivering testing services may enhance testing uptake and engagement, a prerequisite to reducing onward transmission., OBJECTIVE: To determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission., METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to assess preferences for SARS-CoV-2 test type, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Participants (n=4,793) from the U.S. national longitudinal CHASING COVID Cohort Study completed our online survey July 30 - September 8, 2020. We estimated relative importance of testing method attributes and part-worth utilities of attribute levels, and simulated the uptake of an optimized testing scenario relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in a provider's office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days., RESULTS: Test result turnaround time had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). In simulations, immediate or same day test results, both PCR and serology, or oral specimens substantially increased testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test., CONCLUSIONS: Testing strategies that offer both PCR and serology with non-invasive methods and rapid turnaround time would likely have the most uptake and engagement among residents in communities with increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	COVID-19: Clinical characteristics and molecular levels of candidate compounds of prospective herbal and modern drugs in Indonesia. A recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease also called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, has rapidly spread to other countries of the world. The medical and scientific communities are working tirelessly to produce a vaccine due to the lethal nature of this virus. COVID-19 is a novel virus that requires immediate emergency therapy, thereby leading to massive fear of infection, social problems in the community, and an increase in the number of infected people. Therefore, scientists and researchers need to determine the epidemiological cases of the virus, such as its mode of transmission, effective preventive measures, and the nature of the life cycle. In addition, there need to be current literature advances in diagnostic development such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), computed tomography san (CT-Scan), Elisa as well as clinical researches on modern and herbal drugs for the treatment of infected patients. This treatment technique is classified from antiviral drugs such as entry, replication, nucleosides, nucleotides, and protease inhibitors, along with the use of heterocyclic drugs, monoclonal antibodies therapy, vaccine development and herbal formulations that have been pre-clinically tested in vitro and molecular docking. Chemical drug molecules with prospective applications in the treatment of COVID-19 have been included in this review.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	The kinetics of humoral response and its relationship with the disease severity in COVID-19. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic. Here we profiled the humoral response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgM, and IgG against nucleocapsid and spike proteins, along with IgM and IgG antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and total neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). We tested 279 plasma samples collected from 176 COVID-19 patients who presented and enrolled at different stages of their disease. Plasma dilutions were optimized and based on the data, a single dilution of plasma was used. The mean absorbance at 450 nm was measured for Ig levels and NAbs were measured using geometric mean titers. We demonstrate that more severe cases have a late-onset in the humoral response compared to mild/moderate infections. All the antibody titers continue to rise in patients with COVID-19 over the disease course. However, these levels are mostly unrelated to disease severity. The appearance time and titers of NAbs showed a significant positive correlation to the antibodies against spike protein. Our results suggest the late onset of antibody response as a risk factor for disease severity, however, there is a limited role of antibody titers in predicting disease severity of COVID-19.	false
0	Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Crowded indoor environments, such as households, are high-risk settings for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., Objectives: To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses., Data Source: PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission., Study Selection: All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded., Data Extraction and Synthesis: Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed., Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses., Results: A total of 54 relevant studies with 77758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%), to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%)., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that given that individuals with suspected or confirmed infections are being referred to isolate at home, households will continue to be a significant venue for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Contributory role of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations and life expectancy in COVID-19 transmission and low fatality rate in Africa. Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has claimed lots of lives, posing a dire threat to global health. It was predicted that the coronavirus outbreak in the African population would be very lethal and result to economic devastation owing to the prevalence of immune-compromised population, poverty, low lifespan, fragile health care systems, poor economy, and lifestyle factors. Accumulation of mutations gives virus selective advantage for host invasion and adaptation, higher transmissibility of more virulent strains, and drug resistance. The present study determined the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomic variability and the contributory factors to the low COVID-19 fatality in Africa. To assess the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape, 924 viral sequences from the Africa region with their sociobiological characteristics mined from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database were analyzed. Result(s): Mutational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed highly recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein D614G (97.2%), concurrent R203K, and G204R (65.2%) in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and P4715L (97.2%) in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase flagging these regions as SARS-CoV-2 mutational hotspots in the African population. COVID-19 is more severe in older people (> 65 years); Africa has a low percentage of people within this age group (4.36%). The average age of the infected patients observed in this study is 46 years with only 47 infected patients (5.1%) above 65 years in Africa in comparison to 13.12% in countries in other continents with the highest prevalence of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Africa's young generation, the late incidence of the disease, and adherence to public health guidelines are important indicators that may have contributed to the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Africa. However, with the easing of lockdown and regulatory policies, daily increasing incidence in most countries, and low testing and sequencing rate, the epidemiology and the true impact of the pandemic in Africa remain to be unraveled.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	The preliminary comparative results between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients in Western China. BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the comparative clinical characteristics of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients., METHODS: Fifteen Covid-19 and 93 non-Covid-19 patients were included in RNA testing. All epidemiological and clinical data were collected and analyzed, and then comparative results were carried out., RESULTS: Covid-19 patients were older (46.40 +/- 18.21 years vs 34.43 +/- 18.80 years) and had a higher body weight (70.27 +/- 10.67 kg vs 60.54 +/- 12.33 kg, P < 0.05). The main symptoms that were similar between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, and Covid-19 patients showed a lower incidence of sputum production (6.67% vs 45.16%, P < 0.01) and a lower white-cell count (4.83 x 109/L vs 7.43 x 109/L) and lymphocyte count (0.90 x 109/L vs 1.57 x 109/L, P < 0.01). Although there were no differences, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were elevated in Covid-19 patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of CT images were 0.87 and 0.97, respectively. Covid-19 patients showed a higher contact history of Wuhan residents (80% vs 30.11%) and higher familial clustering (53.33% vs 8.60%, P < 0.001). Covid-19 patients showed a higher major adverse events (ARDS, 13.33%; death, 6.67%; P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that Covid-19patients had a significant history of exposure and familial clustering and a higher rate of severe status; biochemical indicators showed lymphocyte depletion.	false
0	Clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization among COVID-19 patients in Ghana: a retrospective cohort study. Introduction: COVID-19 is a global pandemic seen in modern times. The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana., Methods: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization., Results: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3degreeC, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24 +/- 1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration of hospitalization for patients who received AZ only was 2.7 days, which was higher than that of patients who received AZ+CQ and HCQ only (95% CI 0.44, 4.93; p=0.019)., Conclusion: in this cohort of COVID-19 patients, the common symptoms were cough, fever, headache, and sore throat. The use of AZ+CQ or HCQ only as a therapy for managing COVID-19 patients shortened the duration of hospitalization. Copyright: Mary Eyram Ashinyo et al.	false

0	Evidence and implications of pre-existing humoral cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged throughout the world. Building knowledge around Covid-19 is crucial to devise facts based approaches to respond efficiently against this pandemic., AIM: We aimed to investigate pre-existing humoral cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2., METHOD: We have tested the reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen of sera collected from healthy healthcare volunteers in 2014. We assessed immunoglobulins reactive against SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen using a well-validated serological platform; Elecsys assay., RESULTS: Sera from 32 subjects (out of 135 [23.7%]) were reactive to SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen, suggesting the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen antibodies., CONCLUSION: Although the clinical relevance of the observed reactivity can only be speculated and needs to be investigated, the implication of this finding for coronavirus disease 2019 seroepidemiological survey and vaccines' clinical trials is critical.

0	Emergency orthopaedic surgery in the pandemic era: A case series at Cipto Mangunkusumo national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Introduction: Every emergency surgery performed is aimed at saving lives; however, during COVID-19 pandemic, surgeries are often postponed. Many existing recommendations take into account postponing surgery during a pandemic. How these surgeries can lead to increasing infection rates has not been widely published. This study aims to investigate the relationship of emergency orthopaedic surgery and the incidence rate of COVID-19., Presentation of case: This was a case series of 14 patients. The study was performed at the emergency department unit at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. A total of 14 patients underwent orthopaedic surgery in the emergency room of our institution. The mean age of the subjects was 40.07 +/- 20.5 years. Twelve (85.7%) were male patients and 2 (14.3%) were female patients. The average duration of surgery was 125 minutes. The most used type of anaesthesia was general anaesthesia for 6 operations (50%). Patients were hospitalized for an average length of 4 days. Three patients had infiltrates found on plain x-ray examination, which required further examination to determine whether the cause was COVID-19 infection or not. There was no ground glass appearance (GGO) in the three patients in further follow-up examination., Conclusions: We found that emergency orthopaedic surgery was not associated with increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Factors including duration of surgery, length of stay, types of anaesthesia and comorbidities were also not associated with COVID-19 cases in this study. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 Test Strategy to Guide Quarantine Interval in University Student. BACKGROUND: Following COVID-19 exposure, the CDC recommends a 10-14 day quarantine for asymptomatic individuals and more recently a 7 day quarantine with a negative PCR test. We performed a university-based prospective student cohort study to determine if early PCR negativity predicts day 14 negativity., METHODS: We enrolled 101 asymptomatic, quarantining, students, performed nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing on days 3 or 4, 5, 7, 10 and 14 and determined the proportion of concordant negative results for each day versus day 14 with a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval., RESULTS: Overall, 14 of 90 (16%, 95% CI: 9% - 25%) tested positive while in quarantine, with 7 initial positive tests on day 3 or 4, 5 on day 5, 2 on day 7, and none on day 10 or 14. Rates of concordant negative test results are: day 5 vs. day 14 = 45/50 (90%, 95% CI: 78% - 97%); day 7 vs. day 14 = 47/52 (90%, 95% CI: 79% - 97%); day 10 vs. day 14 = 48/53 (91%, 95% CI:79% - 97%), with no evidence of different negative rates between earlier days and day 14 by McNemar's test, p > 0.05., CONCLUSIONS: The 16% positive rate supports the ongoing need to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 cases, but this prospective study provides the first direct evidence that exposed asymptomatic students ages 18-44 years in a university setting are at low risk if released from quarantine at 7 days if they test negative PCR test prior to release.	false
0	Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the first trimester placenta leading to transplacental transmission and fetal demise from an asymptomatic mother. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of the respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 which survives in the tissues during the clinical course of infection but there is limited evidence on placental infection and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The impact of COVID-19 in first trimester pregnancy remains poorly understood. Moreover, how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive in placenta is unknown. Herein we report a case of a pregnant woman in the first trimester who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 8 weeks of gestation although her clinical course was asymptomatic. At 13 weeks of gestation, her throat swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but viral RNA was detected in the placenta and the Spike (S) proteins (S1 and S2) were immunolocalized in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placental villi. Histologically, the villi were generally avascular with peri-villus fibrin deposition and in some areas the syncytiotrophoblast layer appeared lysed. The decidua also had fibrin deposition with extensive leucocyte infiltration suggestive of inflammation. The SARS-CoV-2 crossed the placental barrier, as the viral RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid and the S proteins were detected in the fetal membrane. Ultrasonography revealed extensively subcutaneous edema with pleural effusion suggestive of hydrops fetalis and the absence of cardiac activity indicated fetal demise. This is the first study to provide concrete evidence of persistent placental infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its congenital transmission associated with hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal demise in early pregnancy.

0	"Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?. Air pollution with particulate matter has been implicated in the incidence and the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R0) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus' transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking (66% of Chinese males are smokers), may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19's vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The ""open orientation"" of Clade G spike protein's three peptides as opposed to the ""closed orientation"" of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein's hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.

0	The impact of ABO blood group on COVID-19 infection risk and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Several studies report that ABO blood group polymorphism may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes; however, the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether ABO blood groups are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A total of 715 articles were retrieved from seven databases. Ten articles were selected for meta-analysis after removal of duplicates and two levels of screenings. Overall, individuals with blood group A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.56] and B (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) had a substantially higher risk of COVID-19, whereas this was not the case for blood group AB (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30). Individuals with blood group O was not prone to develop the disease (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the Rh-positive blood group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). A meta-analysis of 5 studies suggested that blood group A was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52). Mild publication bias was found in the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that blood groups A and B may be risk factors for COVID-19, whereas the blood group O appears to be protective. Blood group A may be related to unfavourable outcomes. Further rigorous and high-quality research evidence is needed to confirm this association. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Increased child abuse in Uganda amidst COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, COVID-19 lockdown measures have exposed children to more sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have long-lasting adverse psychological effects on children, there have been comparatively few studies on children's health as compared with adults, particularly in low-income countries. Uganda implemented one of the most stringent lockdowns with bans on transportation and gatherings as well as the closure of schools, stores and places of worship. In order to address the dearth of information in less developed regions, the article aims to provide an insight into the increased cases of child abuse in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data and information were primarily compiled from government and child welfare organisation open-source databases. The psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 have greatly disrupted the living conditions of children, limiting their access to basic needs such as food and health care. In addition, there is a lack of social support, thus putting children at an increased risk of different forms of child abuse. Since the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown in Uganda, there has been a rise in the incidence of child abuse. Increased cases of physical and sexual abuse against children have been reported in different parts of the country as well as increased cases of child labour. To strengthen child protection during the COVID-19 pandemic, this article highlights a need for multi-level stakeholder cooperation to ensure increased funding, increased community awareness and sensitisation, early detection and effective management and referral of child abuse cases.

0	Geographic Disparities in COVID-19 Infections and Deaths: The Role of Transportation. The US government imposed two travel restriction policies to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 but may have funneled asymptomatic air travelers to selected major airports and transportation hubs. Using the most recent JHU COVID-19 database, American Community Survey, Airport and Amtrak data form Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 3,132 US counties we ran negative binomial regressions and Cox regression models to explore the associations between COVID-19 cases and death rates and proximity to airports, train stations, and public transportation. Counties within 25 miles of an airport had 1.392 times the rate of COVID-19 cases and 1.545 times the rate of COVID-19 deaths in comparison to counties that are more than 50 miles from an airport. More effective policies to detect and isolate infected travelers are needed. Policymakers and officials in transportation and public health should collaborate to promulgate policies and procedures to protect travelers and transportation workers from COVID-19.

0	Three-month Follow-up Study of Survivors of Coronavirus Disease 2019 after Discharge. BACKGROUND: Most patients including health care workers (HCWs) survived the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, knowledge about the sequelae of COVID-19 after discharge remains limited., METHODS: A prospectively observational 3-month follow-up study evaluated symptoms, dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG and IgM, lung function, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of survivors of COVID-19 after discharge at Wuhan Union Hospital, China., RESULTS: Seventy-six survivors (55 females) with a mean age of 41.3 +/- 13.8 years were enrolled, and 65 (86%) were HCWs. A total of 69 (91%) patients had returned to their original work at 3-months after discharge. Most of the survivors had symptoms including fever, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness on exertion and palpitations in the three months after discharge. The serum troponin-I levels during the acute illness showed high correlation with the symptom of fatigue after hospital discharge (r = 0.782; P = 0.008) and lymphopenia was correlated with the symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations on exertion of patients after hospital discharge (r = -.285, P = 0.027; r = -.363, P = 0.004, respectively). The mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity and diffusion capacity were all normal (> 80% predicted) and lung HRCTs returned to normal in most of the patients (82%), however, 42% of survivors had mild pulmonary function abnormalities at 3-months after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 IgG turned negative in 11% (6 of 57 patients), 8% (4 of 52 patients) and 13% (7 of 55 patients), and SARS-CoV-2 IgM turned negative in 72% (41 of 57 patients), 85% (44 of 52 patients) and 87% (48 of 55 patients) at 1-month, 2-months and 3-months after discharge, respectively., CONCLUSION: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 caused some mild impairments of survivors within the first three months of their discharge and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was limited, which indicates the necessity of long-term follow-up of survivors of COVID-19.

0	Baculovirus-free insect cell expression system for high yield antibody and antigen production. Antibodies are essential tools for therapy and diagnostics. Yet, production remains expensive as it is mostly done in mammalian expression systems. As most therapeutic IgG require mammalian glycosylation to interact with the human immune system, other expression systems are rarely used for production. However, for neutralizing antibodies that are not required to activate the human immune system as well as antibodies used in diagnostics, a cheaper production system would be advantageous. In our study, we show cost-efficient, easy and high yield production of antibodies as well as various secreted antigens including Interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 related proteins in a baculovirus-free insect cell expression system. To improve yields, we optimized the expression vector, media and feeding strategies. In addition, we showed the feasibility of lyophilization of the insect cell produced antibodies. Furthermore, stability and activity of the antibodies was compared to antibodies produced by Expi293F cells revealing a lower aggregation of antibodies originating from High Five cell production. Finally, the newly established High Five expression system was compared to the Expi293F mammalian expression system in regard of yield and costs. Most interestingly, all tested proteins were producible in our High Five cell expression system what was not the case in the Expi293F system, hinting that the High Five cell system is especially suited to produce difficult-to-express target proteins.	false

0	Burnout, resilience and work engagement among Dutch intensivists in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis: A nationwide survey. PURPOSE: The COVID-19 crisis put a strain on intensive care resources everywhere in the world increasing the risk of burnout. Previously, the prevalence of burnout among Dutch intensivists was found to be low. Engagement and resilience among intensivists have not previously been studied quantitatively, however, both are related to burnout and provide a possible way to mitigate burnout. Our objective was to study burnout and its association with work engagement and resilience among Dutch intensivists in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis., METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to all Dutch intensivists. The questionnaire consisted of questions on personal and work-related characteristics and validated questionnaires: the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Resilience Evaluation Scale., RESULTS: The response rate was 27.2% with 162 evaluable responses. Thirteen respondents (8.0%) were classified as having burnout, 63 (38.9%) respondents were reporting high work engagement. Burnout was found to be negatively associated with both work engagement and resilience., CONCLUSION: In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, we found a raised prevalence of burnout among intensivists, however this is still low in international comparisons. Intensivists with burnout scored low on resilience and low on work engagement. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false

0	"A Strategy to Battle Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Hospital: Identify and Use the Power of ""Immune Survivors"". The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious health and economic problems worldwide. One of the worst scenarios is the collapse of the medical care system due to nosocomial infections. SARS-CoV-2 quickly spreads in closed spaces, crowded areas, and close physical distances, which frequently occur in Japanese medical facilities. Although we are making efforts to avoid such situations, healthcare workers always face the risk of developing a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the workplace because of proximity. Thus, we need to battle SARS-CoV-2 using a unique strategy. We propose a novel strategy to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infections: measurement of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and using the power of ""immune survivors."" We agree with using standard precautions and early isolation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to block the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we face difficulties carrying out these fundamental missions. Now, we focus on ""immune survivors."" If healthcare workers acquired the neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, they are considered ""immune survivors"" with a low risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These ""immune survivors"" can contribute to the care of patients with COVID-19 on the front line. Also, these ""immune survivors"" can function as an envelope by surrounding COVID-19 patients. As a result, ""immune survivors"" can eliminate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in medical facilities as well as in society. We understand that the concept of ""immune survivors"" needs further discussion. No information is available on how long or the titer of neutralizing antibody required for protection from infection. We have just started to measure antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in our hospital. This project will provide further information in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

0	The Lebanese COVID-19 Cohort; A Challenge for the ABO Blood Group System. A sudden outbreak of pneumonia caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world facilitating the declaration of the resultant disease as a pandemic on March 2020. Predisposing factors for acquiring COVID-19 and for developing a severe form of this disease were postulated to be related to the epidemiological, clinical, and genetic characteristics of the patients. Biological markers such as the ABO blood group system were amongst these factors that were proposed to be linked to the variability in the disease course and/or the prevalence of the infection among different groups. Herein, we conducted the first retrospective case-control study from the Middle East and North Africa that tackles the association between the blood group types and the susceptibility to, as well as the severity of, SARS-CoV-2 infection. Contrary to the most acknowledged hypothesis, our results challenged the significance of this association and questioned the role of the ABO blood group system in dictating the severity of this disease. For future similar studies, we endorsed analyzing larger cohorts among different populations and we encouraged implementing more rigorous approaches to diminish the potential confounding effect of some underlying comorbidities and genetic variants that are known to be associated with the ABO blood group system.

0	Dual ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein produced in E. coli and CHO cells reveals epitope masking by N-glycosylation. Spike and nucleocapsid proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2-SP, SARS-CoV-2-NP) are the main immunogenic targets for antibodies. We herein demonstrate that the glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2-NP masks some of its antibody epitopes. In many cases, this can lead to false-negative serological tests. Deglycosylation of SARS-CoV-2-NP significantly increased the number of positive tests. The glycosylation pattern analysis of this protein revealed that the putative N-linked glycosylation sites, at the amino acid positions 48 and 270, co-located with two of the main immunodominant B cell epitopes.

0	Impact of low serum calcium at hospital admission on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. BACKGROUND: Calcium is an essential ion for pathogen survival and virulence and is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Hypocalcemia is a common laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with hypocalcemia could have a worse outcome., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72 hours since hospital admission. Main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support - defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation-, intensive care unit admission or death., RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the study. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-74), 65% were men. Hypocalcemia within 72 hours since hospital admission was present in 63% of patients. A higher number of patients in the hypocalcemia group required high oxygen support during hospitalization (49% vs 32%; p = 0,01) and were admitted to the ICU (42% vs 26%; p = 0,005). No differences in mortality were observed between groups., CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia is frequent in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and can identify patients with worse outcome. More studies are needed to understand the role of calcium metabolism in SARS-CoV-2 infection and to address the clinical implications and therapeutic interventions it might have. Copyright © 2020.

Various vaccine strategies have been proposed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, each with unique strategies for eliciting immune responses. Here, we developed nanoparticle vaccines by covalently conjugating the self-assembled 24-mer ferritin to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and/or heptad repeat (HR) subunits of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. Compared to monomer vaccines, nanoparticle vaccines elicited more robust neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. RBD and RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccinated hACE2 transgenic mice vaccinated with RBD and/or RBD-HR nanoparticles exhibited reduced viral load in the lungs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccines also promoted neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against other coronaviruses. The nanoparticle vaccination of rhesus macaques induced neutralizing antibodies, and T and B cell responses prior to boost immunization; these responses persisted for more than three months. RBD- and HR-based nanoparticles thus present a promising vaccination approach against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Overcoming COVID-19 in West African countries: is herd immunity an option?. The coronavirus infection (COVID-19) to date has no vaccine or effective treatment. Herd immunity offers indirect protection to susceptible members of the population. If the acquired immunity of a community rises above 67%, then a gradual decline in the number of incident cases is recorded. How many deaths would have occurred in the West African countries by the time at least 67% of our people are infected with the present case fatality rate (CFR)? The objective of this study was to develop a forecast of the number of COVID-19 deaths that would be recorded to attain herd immunity for each country in West-Africa. We predicted the numbers of deaths using publicly available demographic and COVID-19 data. To attain herd immunity in West Africa 5.2 million COVID-19 deaths would have occurred assuming the CFR is maintained at the current rates in the region. Attention should be focused on strategies that would limit the spread of infection and protect the most vulnerable population groups while the race to develop an effective vaccine should be hastened.

0	Clinical and epidemiological features discriminating confirmed COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients at screening centres in Madagascar. Early and fast detection of COVID-19 patients help limit the transmission and the widespread of the virus in the community and will have impact on mortality by reducing the incidence of infection among vulnerable people. Therefore, community-based screening is critical. We aimed to identify clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological features that could help discriminate confirmed cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. We found that age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p<0.001), symptoms onset between 3 and 14 days (aOR:1.35, 95%CI:1.09)1.68, p=0.006), fever or history of fever (aOR:1.75, 95%CI:1.42-2.14, p<0.001), cough (aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.31-2.04), sore throat (aOR:0.65, 95%CI:0.49-0.85, p=0.002), ageusia (aOR:2.24, 95%CI:1.42-3.54, p=0.001), anosmia (aOR:6.04, 95%CI:4.19-8.69, p<0.001), chest pain (aOR:0.63, 95%CI:0.47-0.85, p=0.003), myalgia and/or arthralgia (aOR:1.64, 95%CI:1.31-2.04, p<0.001), household cluster (aOR:1.49, 95%CI:1.17-1.91, p=0.001) and evidence of confirmed cases in the neighbourhood (aOR:1.92, 95%CI:1.56-2.37, p<0.001) could help discriminate COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative. A screening score derived from multivariate logistic regression was developed to assess the probability of COVID-19 in patients. We suggest that a patient with a score >= 14 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A patient with a score >= 30 should be considered at high risk of COVID-19 and should undergo testing but also need prompt isolation and contact tracing.Copyright © 2020.

0	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pediatric gastroenterology. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for the new pandemic, which remains an important health and economic challenge worldwide. The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	COVID-19 Susceptibility in Bronchial Asthma. BACKGROUND: Bronchial asthma has not been adequately assessed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Respiratory allergy is associated with significant reductions in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is the entry receptor for COVID-19., OBJECTIVE: To observe COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with bronchial asthma, analyze the prevalence of asthma in a large cohort of consecutive outpatient subjects who were tested with the RT-PCR assay for COVID-19., METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using data from a large nationwide health maintenance organization in Israel. All health maintenance organization enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the subjects with negative and positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and between COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive subjects with and without asthma were analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 37,469 subjects were tested for COVID-19 RT-PCR, and results for 2,266 (6.05%) of them were positive. A significantly higher proportion of smokers was observed in the COVID-19-negative group than in the COVID-19-positive group (4734 [13.45%] vs 103 [4.55%]; P < .001). Asthma was found in 153 (6.75 %) subjects of the COVID-19-positive group and in 3388 (9.62%) subjects of the COVID-19-negative group (P < .001). No significant impact of antileukotrienes, inhaled corticosteroids, and long-acting beta-blockers use was revealed on COVID-19 positivity proportions. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, smoking, and comorbidity revealed a negative association of asthma with the likelihood of being positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.87; P = .001)., CONCLUSIONS: We observed lower COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with preexisting asthma.

0	Grief: The Epidemic Within an Epidemic. COVID-19 has not only dramatically changed the way we live, it has also impacted how we die and how we grieve. With more and more Americans dying in ICU settings, away from family, and more funerals being held virtually, the pandemic has seriously curtailed normal expressions of grief and cultural mourning. Given the CDC guidelines for funerals and social distancing, simple human touch is no longer a mitigating force against prolonged grief. So, while one epidemic has a face and a name, we point to a second, more silent yet potentially equally devastating one, unacknowledged grief, and emphasize how policy can be a current therapeutic. We can wait for a vaccine, but we can also act now through thoughtful policymaking that acknowledges this second epidemic.	false
0	Association of PTSD with COVID-19 testing and infection in the Veterans Health Administration. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity. Associations between PTSD and COVID-19 outcomes may affect Veterans Health Administration (VA) services, as PTSD occurs at higher rates among veterans than the general population. While previous research has identified the potential for increased PTSD prevalence resulting from COVID-19 as a public health concern, no known research examines the effect of pre-existing PTSD on COVID-19 test-seeking behavior or infection. This study aimed to evaluate pre-existing PTSD as a predictor of COVID-19 testing and test positivity. The sample consisted of 6,721,407 veterans who sought VA care between March 1, 2018 and February 29, 2020. Veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were more likely to receive COVID-19 testing than veterans without PTSD. However, among those with available COVID-19 test results (n = 168,032), veterans with a previous PTSD clinical diagnosis were less likely to test positive than veterans without PTSD. Elevated COVID-19 testing rates among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased COVID-19 health concerns and/or hypervigilance. Lower rates of COVID-19 test positivity among veterans with PTSD may reflect increased social isolation, or overrepresentation in the tested population due to higher overall use of VA services. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the identification of patient-level psychiatric predictors of testing and test positivity can facilitate the targeted provision of medical and mental health services to individuals in need.

0	Corona Virus Disease 2019 patients with different disease severity or age range: A single-center study of clinical features and prognosis. This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and prognosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and to compare these features among COVID-19 patients with different disease severity or age range.Totally, 129 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled, and the information about demographics, comorbidities, medical histories, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings at the time of hospital admission were collected. Meanwhile, their clinical outcomes were recorded. According to the fourth version of the guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of China, patients were divided into subgroups according to disease severity (moderate and severe/critical) or age (<40 years, 40-64 years and >=65 years). In total patients, the most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough (all incidences over 50%). Other common clinical symptoms included tiredness/anorexia, shortness of breath, dyspnea, aching pain, expectoration, diarrhea, shivering, and nausea/vomiting. The mortality rate was 5.4%, and the median value of hospital stay was 16.0 (11.0-23.0) days. Subgroup analyses disclosed that severe/critical patients exhibited increased neutrophil count, neutrophils, C-reactive protein, calcitonin, alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, and more deaths compared with that in moderate patients. Regarding age, it correlated with more common fever, higher levels of red blood cell, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophils, red cell volume distribution width standard deviation-coefficient of variation, calcitonin, alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and D-dimer, raised death rate and prolonged hospital stay.Our findings provide valuable evidence regarding clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients to help with the understanding of the disease and prognosis improvement.	false
0	Comparison of various serological assays for novel SARS-COV-2. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to compare different immunoassays. We evaluated three immunochromatographic test (The StrongStep RSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit, AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit, and Wondfo R SARS-CoV-2 Antibody) and two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CMIA) (Covid-19 VIRCLIA R IgM+IgA/IgG monotest and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay) in COVID-19 patients. The assays were performed using serum samples of three group patients, i.e., healthy controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, and patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative clinically diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. The detection percentages of IgG with the StrongStep R SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit were similar in both groups (83.3% and 80.6%, respectively in group 2, p = 0.766) and (42.9% and 50.0%, respectively in group 3, p = 0.706). There were some differences on IgM detection between StrongStep R SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit (11.1% and 30.6%, respectively in group 2, p = 0.042 and 0.0% and 28.6%, respectively in group 3, p = 0.031). The positive rate of IgG in group 2 is higher compared to group 3 with the two immunoassays tested. We observe the same positive rates of IgG with the two CMIA. Our study shows excellent performance of CMIA compared to immunochromatographic test and confirms its potential use in the diagnosis of the new SARS-CoV-2.	false

0	The Relation Between Trace Element Status (Zinc, Copper, Magnesium) and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Infection During Pregnancy. SARS CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused many deaths in the recent pandemic. This study aimed to determine zinc, copper and magnesium status on pregnant women with COVID-19. 100 healthy (33/32/35) and 100 SARS-CoV-2 positive (34/33/33) pregnant women were included in the study according to their trimesters. Blood samples were obtained from the patients along with the initial laboratory tests for clinical outcomes upon their first admission to hospital. In the first and third trimesters serum zinc level was lower (p:0,004 and p:0,02), serum copper level was higher (p:0,006 and p:0,008), the Zn / Cu ratio decreased(p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) and the serum magnesium level was higher(p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) in the COVID-19 group. In the second trimester COVID-19 patients had lower serum zinc (p:0,05) and copper levels (p:0,0003) compared to controls. Disease severity correlated with zinc/copper ratio in COVID19 patients (p:0.018, r:-0.243). Serum zinc and Zn/Cu ratio levels had a negative relationship with acute phase markers such as IL-6, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, procalcitonin and C-reactive Protein. Also, increased serum magnesium level may play a role in decreased white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte cell count and increased CRP levels in the third trimester. This study indicated that trace element status changed in pregnant women with COVID-19. The effect of trace elements on pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 infection was investigated in comparison with healthy pregnant women for the first time. This effect will be revealed better in more comprehensive studies to be planned in the future.	false
0	"The differences of clinical characteristics and outcomes between imported and local patients of COVID-19 in Hunan: a two-center retrospective study. BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics and outcomes of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia are different in Hubei compared to other regions in China. But there are few comparative studies on the differences between imported and local patients which may provide information of the different courses of the virus after transmission., METHODS: We investigated 169 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in two centers in Hunan Province, and divided them into two groups according to epidemiological history, ""imported patients"" refers to patient with a clear history of travel in Wuhan within 14 days before onset, and "" local patients"" refers to local resident without a recent history of travel in Wuhan, aiming to analyze the difference in clinical characteristics and outcomes between the two groups. All the epidemiological, clinical, imaging, and laboratory data were analyzed and contrasted., RESULTS: The incidence of fever on admission in imported patients was significantly higher than local patients. There was a significantly higher proportion of abnormal pulmonary signs, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, prolonged PT, elevated D-dimer and elevated blood glucose in imported patients. Compared with local patients, the proportion using antibiotics, glucocorticoids and gamma globulin were significantly higher in imported patients. The moderate type was more common in local patients, and the severe type were more frequent in imported patients. In addition, the median duration of viral clearance was longer in imported patients., CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that imported cases were more likely to develop into severe cases, compared with local patients and required more powerful treatments. Trial registration Registered 21st March 2020, and this study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (Approved Number. 2020017)."	false
0	Autonomic dysfunction in 'long COVID': rationale, physiology and management strategies. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented morbidity, mortality and global disruption. Following the initial surge of infections, focus shifted to managing the longer-term sequelae of illness in survivors. 'Post-acute COVID' (known colloquially as 'long COVID') is emerging as a prevalent syndrome. It encompasses a plethora of debilitating symptoms (including breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations and orthostatic intolerance) which can last for weeks or more following mild illness. We describe a series of individuals with symptoms of 'long COVID', and we posit that this condition may be related to a virus- or immune-mediated disruption of the autonomic nervous system resulting in orthostatic intolerance syndromes. We suggest that all physicians should be equipped to recognise such cases, appreciate the symptom burden and provide supportive management. We present our rationale for an underlying impaired autonomic physiology post-COVID-19 and suggest means of management. Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020. All rights reserved.	false
0	The Syndromic Spectrum of COVID-19 and Correlates of Admission Parameters with Severity-outcome Gradients: A Retrospective Study. Background: Clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 may have regional variations. This study aimed to discern their association with severity of illness and mortality in tertiary setup of Delhi, India., Methods: Retrospective data of hospitalised COVID-19 patients over 3 months (end March to June 2020) were evaluated for symptom profile, blood investigations and chest radiograph data and classified according to COVID-19 severity and as survivors and non-survivors., Results: Average age (n=182) was 46.1 years, male to female ratio 1.4:1. Fever (51.1%), cough (49.4%) and breathlessness (48.3%) were the commonest symptoms, and frequency of all the three increased with severity of COVID-19. Fever duration, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated blood urea, transaminitis and higher Brixia score on chest X-ray were also more in severe COVID-19 compared to mild and moderate categories. Higher age, more comorbidities, fever, breathlessness and chest pain; longer duration of fever, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, elevated serum urea, creatinine, transaminases and hyperglycemia, and higher radiographic Brixia score were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors., Conclusion: Greater prevalence of symptoms (alone and in combination) and derangements in blood biochemistry are seen in severe COVID-19 compared to mild or moderate cases, and also in non-survivors compared to survivors.

0	Murine coronavirus nonstructural protein ns2 is not essential for virus replication in transformed cells. Two isolates of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM, which differed in their ability to express the nonstructural gene product ns2, were characterized. The MHV Wb3 isolate encodes a 30,000-molecular-weight ns2 protein that can be readily detected in infected cells by using a specific monoclonal antibody, MAb 2A. The MHV Wb1 isolate is a deletion mutant that lacks a functional ns2 gene and the transcriptional signals required for the synthesis of an ns2 mRNA. However, there are no obviously significant differences in the growth of the MHV Wb1 and MHV Wb3 isolates in continuous cell lines or in the synthesis of viral mRNAs or proteins in infected cells. These results demonstrate that the ns2 gene product is not essential for MHV replication in transformed murine cells and suggests that the function of the ns2 gene may only be manifest in vivo.	false
0	Built environment and the metropolitan pandemic: Analysis of the COVID-19 spread in Hong Kong. The COVID-19 reported initially in December 2019 led to thousands and millions of people infections, deaths at a rapid scale, and a global scale. Metropolitans suffered serious pandemic problems as the built environments of metropolitans contain a large number of people in a relatively small area and allow frequent contacts to let virus spread through people's contacting with each other. The spread inside a metropolitan is heterogeneous, and we propose that the spatial variation of built environments has a measurable association with the spread of COVID-19. This paper is the pioneering work to investigate the missing link between the built environment and the spread of the COVID-19. In particular, we intend to examine two research questions: (1) What are the association of the built environment with the risk of being infected by the COVID-19? (2) What are the association of the built environment with the duration of suffering from COVID-19? Using the Hong Kong census data, confirmed cases of COVID-19 between January to August 2020 and large size of built environment sample data from the Hong Kong government, our analysis are carried out. The data is divided into two phases before (Phase 1) and during the social distancing measure was relaxed (Phase 2). Through survival analysis, ordinary least squares analysis, and count data analysis, we find that (1) In Phase 1, clinics and restaurants are more likely to influence the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, public transportation (i.e. MTR), public market, and the clinics influence the prevalence of COVID-19. (2) In Phase 1, the areas of tertiary planning units (i.e., TPU) with more restaurants are found to be positively associated with the period of the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, restaurants and public markets induce long time occurrence of the COVID-19. (3) In Phase 1, restaurant and public markets are the two built environments that influence the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. In Phase 2, the number of restaurants is positively related to the number of COVID-19 reported cases. It is suggested that governments should not be too optimistic to relax the necessary measures. In other words, the social distancing measure should remain in force until the signals of the COVID-19 dies out. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Prevalence, Clinical Presentations and Treatment Outcomes of COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers at a Dedicated Hospital in India. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rapidly spreading in India and across the world. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 patients, and require special attention. Limited information is available about its effect in HCWs. Secondary transmission from HCWs is a possibility among patients, family members, and the community. Therefore, it is important to investigate the infection risk of HCWs and the clinical characteristics of affected cases and possible source of infection with exposure details. The aim of this study is to analyze the medical records of HCWs with COVID-19 retrospectively and carry out the analysis of the data of HCWs with COVID-19 at TNMC and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH, COVID-19 Hospital) in Mumbai. Interim analysis was carried out for the data collected from 6th April to 20th August 2020. Total 3711 HCWs (frontline, 74.32%, non-frontline, 25.68%) are working at NH Mumbai. We observed 11% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, 4% co-infection and 1% mortality. Majority (85%) of the HCWs with COVID-19 were symptomatic and 15% were asymptomatic. Comorbidities were reported in 19% of HCWs with COVID-19. Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were the most common co-morbidities reported. More than 4% percent of HCWs with COVID-19 were also positive for plasmodium vivax Malaria. The results of the study will be useful for determining the impact of COVID-19 and adverse outcomes in HCWs, identifying probable mode of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. This is required for planning the strategies to handle the epidemic of COVID-19 among HCWs in Mumbai region, and at Maharashtra state level.

0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) set to increase burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in Kenya. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in Kenya on March 13, 2020, is spreading rapidly. As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya. All due care should be taken, to prevent and effectively manage the disease, to avert an imminent epidemic of atherosclerotic disease. Copyright ©Julius Ogeng'o et al.	false

Introduction Lemierre's syndrome (LS) refers to infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) developed as a complication of an oropharyngeal infection. It is a serious condition which may lead to septicemia and septic embolization. LS is most frequently caused by the anaerobic Fusobacterium necrophorum. In the current post-antibiotic era, it is rare (annual incidence of 0.8 cases/million). Many clinicians are unaware of LS, leading it to be termed ""the forgotten disease."" Signs and symptoms include odynophagia, fever and easy fatigue simulating, among others, infection by COVID-19. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should be started promptly. If a deep abscess is present, drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent sepsis or embolization, surgical ligation/excision of the IJV may be considered. Currently, the most controversial role in LS management is anticoagulation. Compared with pre-antibiotic era mortality has much improved (0-18%). Since 2004 there are only four cases of LS reported in Portugal (Medline). Objectives To report a case of late diagnosis and highlight the pitfalls due to initial suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods Case report. A 37-year-old female presented to our institution with left-sided neck pain, odynophagia and fever. A diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and the patient was discharged. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal-swab-test was negative. One week later, due to persistent fever, dyspnea, thoracalgia and easy fatigue the patient returned. Blood samples showed increased white-cell-count (17.150/muL) and C-reactive-protein (378 mg/L). On CT, areas of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient was transferred to COVID-19 area and started ceftriaxone, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. On day 4, considering 3 negative tests hydroxychloroquine was abandoned. Diagnosis of an atypical pneumonia was made and antibiotherapy was changed to doxycycline and ceftazidime. Due to moderate size pleural effusion a thoracentesis was performed. On day 7, as cervical pain and tumefaction were persisting, a contrast-enhanced cervical CT was ordered, showing peritonsillar thickening and thrombosis of the left IJV with emphysema (Figure 1). Antibiotherapy was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and anticoagulation was started. Results After 2 weeks, inflammatory markers were normal and a reduction in pulmonary opacities was observed. All microbiological cultures were negative. The patient completed the last 3 weeks of antibiotherapy under ambulatory hospitalization. Screening for thrombophilia was negative. Anticoagulation was kept for 3 months. Conclusions In a patient with former oropharyngeal infection presenting with pneumonia, LS should be suspected. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should include anaerobic coverage. Anticoagulation may hasten local infection control and prevent septic embolization, optimizing pneumonia resolution."	false

In this case report we present a rare case of a patient with multiple risk factors for severe coronavirus disease (COVID 19) in whom intensive glucocorticoid treatment due to incipient nephrotic syndrome coincided with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high baseline risk profile and the use of glucocorticoids the patient developed only mild disease including IgG SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.	false
0	A role for naturally occurring variation of the murine coronavirus spike protein in stabilizing association with the cellular receptor. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, initiates infection by binding to its cellular receptor (MHVR) via spike (S) proteins projecting from the virion membrane. The structures of these S proteins vary considerably among MHV strains, and this variation is generally considered to be important in determining the strain-specific pathologies of MHV infection, perhaps by affecting the interaction between MHV and the MHVR. To address the relationships between S variation and receptor binding, assays capable of measuring interactions between MHV and MHVR were developed. The assays made use of a novel soluble form of the MHVR, sMHVR-Ig, which comprised the virus- binding immunoglobulin-like domain of MHVR fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin GL sMHVR-Ig was stably expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in human 293 EBNA cells and was immobilized to Sepharose-protein G via the Fc domain. The resulting Sepharose beads were used to adsorb radiolabelled MHV particles. At 4degreeC, the beads specifically adsorbed two prototype MHV strains, MHV JHM (strain 4) and a tissue culture-adapted mutant of MHV JHM, the JHMX strain. A shift to 37degreeC resulted in elution of JHM but not JHMX. This in vitro observation of JHM (but not JHMX) elution from its receptor at 37degreeC was paralleled by a corresponding 37degreeC elution of receptor-associated JHM (but not JHMX) from tissue culture cells. The basis for this difference in maintenance of receptor association was correlated with a large deletion mutation present within the JHMX S protein, as sMHVR-Ig exhibited relatively thermostable binding to vaccinia virus-expressed S proteins containing the deletion. These results indicate that naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus S protein affect the stability of the initial interaction with the host cell and thus contribute to the likelihood of successful infection by incoming virions. These changes in virus entry features may result in coronaviruses with novel pathogenic properties.	false

0	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Pregnant Woman. BACKGROUND: Recent reports have described a rare but severe complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in nonpregnant adults that is associated with extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and appears to be secondary to a hyperinflammatory state., CASE: A multiparous woman at 28 weeks of gestation, diagnosed with COVID-19 4 weeks prior, was admitted with chest pain. Evaluation indicated myocarditis and marked elevations of inflammatory markers consistent with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults. The patient developed cardiogenic shock and required mechanical ventilation. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose corticosteroids was associated with a favorable maternal and fetal outcome., CONCLUSION: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy is a critical illness, presenting several weeks after initial infection. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobin and corticosteroids was associated with a favorable outcome.	false
0	Purchaseintention of elderly in a pandemic covid-19 situation based on analysis ofcustomer-based brand equity. Background: During an unpredictable situation (uncertain environment), high purchase intentions for better and quality services results providers need an extraordinary level of expertise in the healthcare market. Purpose(s): To determine the effect of customer-based brand equity on purchase intention. Method(s): observational study with cross-sectional design. The population was all elderly in the East Lombok Regency, samples that fulfilled the criteria; not experience chronic diseases such as stroke, cataracts, chronic kidney disease (CKD), severe diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. Measurement of independence used the ADL Bartle Index instrument. The cognitive level used the MMSE instrument and respondents were willing to fill in the questionnaire. Result(s): the characteristics of respondents and customer-based brand equity on purchase intention used the chi-square test and fisher's exact test. Risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals of customer-based brand equity, namely brand awareness 1,243 (1,000 to 1,546), brand association 1,245 (1,014 to 1,527), perceived quality 1,229 (1,014 to 1,488), and brand loyalty 1,240 (1,039 to 1,479), the test results showed a significant relationship and had a prevalence ratio (PR)> 1 to the purchase intention of outpatient health centers. Conclusion(s): the majority of respondents who have an elderly purchase intention for outpatient services at the public health center.Copyright © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.	false
0	Characteristics, outcomes, and mortality amongst 133,589 patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases diagnosed with, and 48,418 hospitalised for COVID-19: a multinational distributed network cohort analysis. Objective: Patients with autoimmune diseases were advised to shield to avoid COVID-19, but information on their prognosis is lacking. We characterised 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalisation with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza., Design: Multinational network cohort study., Setting: Electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (NYC, United States [US]), Optum [US], Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (US), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain), and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea)., Participants: All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalised with influenza in 2017-2018 were included., Main outcome measures: 30-day complications during hospitalisation and death., Results: We studied 133,589 patients diagnosed and 48,418 hospitalised with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. The majority of participants were female (60.5% to 65.9%) and aged >=50 years. The most prevalent autoimmune conditions were psoriasis (3.5 to 32.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.9 to 18.9%), and vasculitis (3.3 to 17.6%). Amongst hospitalised patients, Type 1 diabetes was the most common autoimmune condition (4.8% to 7.5%) in US databases, rheumatoid arthritis in HIRA (18.9%), and psoriasis in SIDIAP-H (26.4%). Compared to 70,660 hospitalised with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2% to 4.3% versus 6.3% to 24.6%)., Conclusions: Patients with autoimmune diseases had high rates of respiratory complications and 30-day mortality following a hospitalization with COVID-19. Compared to influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality. Future studies should investigate predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with autoimmune diseases., What is already known about this topic: Patients with autoimmune conditions may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection andcomplications. There is a paucity of evidence characterising the outcomes of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with prevalent autoimmune conditions., What this study adds: Most people with autoimmune diseases who required hospitalisation for COVID-19 were women, aged 50 years or older, and had substantial previous comorbidities.Patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had prevalent autoimmune diseases had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes as compared to those with prevalent autoimmune diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19.A variable proportion of 6% to 25% across data sources died within one month of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and prevalent autoimmune diseases.For people with autoimmune diseases, COVID-19 hospitalisation was associated with worse outcomes and 30-day mortality compared to admission with influenza in the 2017-2018 season.	false

0	A Propensity-Matched Cohort Study of Tocilizumab in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. To determine the impact of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, on survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Observational cohort study of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. A propensity-matched (1:1) analysis was used to compare patients who received tocilizumab to controls who did not. Competing risk survival analysis was used to determine the primary outcome of time to mortality, and adjusted log-linear and logistic regression for secondary outcomes., Setting: Three hospitals within the NYU Langone Health system in New York., Patients: Consecutive adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019., Intervention: Tocilizumab 400-mg IV once in addition to standard of care or standard of care alone., Measurements and Main Results: Data from 3,580 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive qualifying hospitalized patients were included, of whom 497 (13.9%) were treated with tocilizumab. In the analysis of tocilizumab-treated patients and matched controls, fewer tocilizumab-treated patients died (145/497, 29.2%) than did controls (211/497, 42.4%). In the adjusted competing risk regression model, tocilizumab therapy was associated with improved survival relative to controls (hazard ratio = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.18-0.33, p < 0.001). Tocilizumab-treated patients and controls had similar adjusted time to discharge from hospital (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.78-1.17, p = 0.67). However, they had longer adjusted ICU length of stay (rate ratio = 3.1, 95% CI = 2.5-3.7, p < 0.001) and a higher adjusted infection rate (odds ratio = 4.18, 95% CI = 2.72-6.52, p < 0.001) than controls., Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy was associated with significantly improved survival in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. This survival benefit was associated with increased ICU length of stay and increased infection rate, even as more patients in the tocilizumab group were rescued from rapid death. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Secondary infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: incidence and predictive factors. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to describe the incidence and predictive factors of secondary infections in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., METHODS: This was a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital between 25th February and 6th April 2020 (NCT04318366). We considered secondary bloodstream infections (BSIs) or possible lower respiratory tract infections (pLRTIs) occurring 48 hours after hospital admission until death or discharge. We calculated multivariable Fine-Gray models to assess factors associated with risk of secondary infections., RESULTS: Among 731 patients, a secondary infection was diagnosed in 68 patients (9.3%); 58/731 patients (7.9%) had at least one BSI and 22/731 patients (3.0%) at least one pLRTI. The overall 28-day cumulative incidence was 16.4% (95%CI 12.4-21.0%). Most of the BSIs were due to Gram-positive pathogens (76/106 isolates, 71.7%), specifically coagulase-negative staphylococci (53/76, 69.7%), while among Gram-negatives (23/106, 21.7%) Acinetobacter baumanii (7/23, 30.4%) and Escherichia coli (5/23, 21.7%) predominated. pLRTIs were caused mainly by Gram-negative pathogens (14/26, 53.8%). Eleven patients were diagnosed with putative invasive aspergillosis. At multivariable analysis, factors associated with secondary infections were low baseline lymphocyte count (<=0.7 versus >0.7 per 109/L, subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHRs) 1.93, 95%CI 1.11-3.35), baseline PaO2/FiO2 (per 100 points lower: sdHRs 1.56, 95%CI 1.21-2.04), and intensive-care unit (ICU) admission in the first 48 hours (sdHR 2.51, 95%CI 1.04-6.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a high incidence of secondary infections. At multivariable analysis, early need for ICU, respiratory failure, and severe lymphopenia were identified as risk factors for secondary infections.

0	Clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 due to different exposure history. An ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world. However, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 related to different modes of exposure have not been well defined. We aimed to explore the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 related to one-time community exposure versus continuous household exposure.Retrospective case-control study involving COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary designated center in China was performed. Patients were enrolled if they had known exposure history of one-time community exposure or continuous household exposure. Twenty patients were compared in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, chest CT images, laboratory results, treatments, and clinical outcomes at 1-month follow-up. There were 10 patients in one-time community and continuous household exposure groups respectively. Males compromised 80% and 40% while the median ages were 37.5 and 51 years old in the 2 groups, respectively. Fever and cough were most common symptoms. Ground-glass opacities were presented on chest CT scan in 90% and 70% of the patients, and the median CT scores were 7 and 16 on admission, respectively. Three patients ranked severe in the community exposure group while 7 patients were severe or critical in household exposure group. On 1-month follow-up, all patients were improved clinically but COVID-19 IgG antibody detected positive. Median follow-up CT scores were 0 and 13 while pulmonary function test abnormalities were 0/9 and 2/7 in the 2 groups, respectively.COVID-19 patients with one-time community exposure tended to be mild in severity and had better outcomes, comparing to those with continuous household exposure.	false
0	Case report of COVID-19 in an elderly patient: could SARS-CoV2 trigger myositis?. Though the exact etiology of autoimmune diseases still remains not completely known, there are various factors which are known to contribute to be trigger of autoimmune diseases. Viral infection is known to be among the other. It is known as the infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can be an autoimmune trigger, so, we suppose that SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) could be as well. Several authors have highlighted the temporal consequence between SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmune diseases. In this case report we described a patient admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia with completely negative autoimmunity at admission who developed major pulmonary interstitial disease. During the hospitalization the weaning difficulties from oxygen led us to the repetition of autoimmunity pattern which became positive (both during hospitalization then after two months from dismission) with marked positivity for specific antibodies for myositis even after the patient's infectious healing. In the follow-up, the patient continued to have asthenia and muscle weakness despite steroid therapy. She is still in follow-up and will be further evaluated over time. Can we therefore think that in this case the development of autoimmunity can persist beyond the infectious phase and determine over time the development of a real autoimmune myositis?	false
0	A rare case of co-occurrence of pulmonary embolism and left ventricular thrombus in a patient with COVID-19. The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality, not only causing devastating lung injury but also has an enormous effect on the cardiovascular system. The hypercoagulable state associated with coronavirus 2019 plays a major role in the disease manifestation. Venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism remains the most common thrombotic manifestation of the disease as compared to arterial thrombosis. Nonetheless, the co-occurrence of both venous and arterial thrombosis in a coronavirus 2019 patient, to our knowledge, has rarely been reported. Herein, we are presenting a case of co-occurrence of left ventricular thrombosis with pulmonary embolism in the setting of coronavirus 2019 with successful treatment with apixaban.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by dimeric IgA. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals following diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Further, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be two-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were on average fifteen times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target. Thus, dimeric IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy. Copyright © 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science.	false
0	Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities for people with epilepsy. In this cohort study, we aim to compare outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with severe epilepsy and other co-morbidities living in long-term care facilities which all implemented early preventative measures, but different levels of surveillance. During 25-week observation period (16 March-6 September 2020), we included 404 residents (118 children), and 1643 caregivers. We compare strategies for infection prevention, control, and containment, and related outcomes, across four UK long-term care facilities. Strategies included early on-site enhancement of preventative and infection control measures, early identification and isolation of symptomatic cases, contact tracing, mass surveillance of asymptomatic cases and contacts. We measured infection rate among vulnerable people living in the facilities and their caregivers, with asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, including fatality rate. We report 38 individuals (17 residents) who tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive, with outbreaks amongst residents in two facilities. At Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy (CCE), 10/98 residents tested positive: two symptomatic (one died), eight asymptomatic on weekly enhanced surveillance; 2/275 caregivers tested positive: one symptomatic, one asymptomatic. At St Elizabeth's (STE), 7/146 residents tested positive: four symptomatic (one died), one positive during hospital admission for symptoms unrelated to COVID-19, two asymptomatic on one-off testing of all 146 residents; 106/601 symptomatic caregivers were tested, 13 positive. In addition, during two cycles of systematically testing all asymptomatic carers, four tested positive. At The Meath (TM), 8/80 residents were symptomatic but none tested; 26/250 caregivers were tested, two positive. At Young Epilepsy (YE), 8/80 children were tested, all negative; 22/517 caregivers were tested, one positive. Infection outbreaks in long-term care facilities for vulnerable people with epilepsy can be quickly contained, but only if asymptomatic individuals are identified through enhanced surveillance at resident and caregiver level. We observed a low rate of morbidity and mortality, which confirmed that preventative measures with isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 residents can reduce resident-to-resident and resident-to-caregiver transmission. Children and young adults appear to have lower infection rates. Even in people with epilepsy and multiple co-morbidities, we observed a high percentage of asymptomatic people suggesting that epilepsy-related factors (anti-seizure medications and seizures) do not necessarily lead to poor outcomes.

0	Can we predict who will be more anxious and depressed in the COVID-19 ward?. OBJECTIVE: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for anxiety and depression, but most studies about mental health during the pandemic included the general public, healthcare workers, and students. We aimed to explore the anxiety and depression levels, prevalence and predictors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., METHODS: In this cross-sectional, exploratory study, sociodemographic and clinical features of 281 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were explored. Patients underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered through a telephonic interview., RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 55.0+/-14.9years. One hundred forty-three (50.9%) patients were male, and 138 (49.1%) were female. Ninety-eight (34.9%) patients had significant levels of anxiety and 118 (42.0%) had significant levels of depression. Female gender, staying alone in a hospital room, early days of hospital stay, and any lifetime psychiatric disorder was associated with symptoms of anxiety. Being over 50years of age, staying alone in a hospital room, and NSAID use before the week of hospital admission were associated with symptoms of depression. Anxiety and depression levels were lower when family members who tested positive for COVID-19 stayed in the same hospital room during treatment., CONCLUSION: Women, patients >50years, patients who used NSAIDs before hospital admission, and those with lifetime psychiatric disorders may be at risk for anxiety and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 ward. Allowing family members with COVID-19 to stay in the same hospital room may be associated with lower anxiety and depression levels. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	The Associated Factors of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Wuhan, China. This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, China. A total of 99 COVID-19 patients were recruited and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Scale. Results showed there was no significant difference in anxiety or depressive symptoms between male and female. Patients aged 46-60 years old had a higher ratio of both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Besides, patients whose hospital stays was longer than 14 days had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than those stays was less than 7 days. There was no significant difference in the correlation between level of dyspnea and the levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients might have anxiety and depressive symptoms during hospitalization. Clinicians should pay attention to the middle age group and patients with longer hospital stays.	false
0	Associations Between Prenatal Food Insecurity and Prematurity, Pediatric Health Care Utilization, and Postnatal Social Needs. OBJECTIVE: Childhood food insecurity endangers child development and health outcomes. Food insecurity will grow increasingly common in the economic wake of the coronavirus pandemic and prenatal care represents an early, clinical opportunity to identify families at risk. However, longitudinal relationships between clinically-identified prenatal food insecurity and prematurity, pediatric health care utilization, and postnatal social needs have not been described., METHODS: We examined longitudinal data from mother-child dyads who received prenatal and pediatric care and social needs screening at a large academically-affiliated safety net medical center between October 2018 and July 2019. Associations among household food insecurity and premature birth, pediatric inpatient and outpatient utilization, missed immunizations, and postnatal social needs were estimated using adjusted regression., RESULTS: Among the 268 mothers, those who experienced prenatal household food insecurity had 3 times higher odds of having a child born prematurely (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.9, p=0.05) and had children with higher inpatient hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6, p=0.04) and missed immunizations (IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.3, p=0.03) in the first 6 months of the child's life. These mothers also had higher odds of having any social needs in the pediatric setting (odds ratio 3.4; 95% CI 1.5-8.0, p=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal household food insecurity was linked to future adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes in low-income mother-child dyads. Food insecurity identifies children at social and medical risk, providing an early clinical opportunity to intervene. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Setting minimum clinical performance specifications for tests based on disease prevalence and minimum acceptable positive and negative predictive values: Practical considerations applied to COVID-19 testing. OBJECTIVES: Several guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have recommended establishing an a priori definition of minimum clinical performance specifications before test selection and method evaluation., METHODS: Using positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), we constructed a spreadsheet tool for determining the minimum clinical specificity (conditional on NPV or PPV, sensitivity and prevalence) and minimum clinical sensitivity (conditional on NPV or PPV, specificity and prevalence) of tests., RESULTS: At a prevalence of 1%, there are no minimum sensitivity requirements to achieve a desired NPV of 60%-95% for a given clinical specificity above 20%. It is not possible to achieve 60-95% PPV even with 100% clinical sensitivity, except when the clinical specificity is near 100%. The opposite trend is seen in high prevalence settings (60%), where a relatively low minimum clinical sensitivity is required to achieve a desired PPV for a given clinical specificity, and a higher minimum clinical specificity is required to achieve a desired NPV for a given clinical sensitivity., DISCUSSION: The selection of laboratory tests and the testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 involves delicate trade-offs between NPV and PPV based on prevalence and clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Practitioners and health authorities should carefully consider the clinical scenarios under which the test result will be used and select the most appropriate testing strategy that fulfils the a priori defined clinical performance specification.

0	High-Risk Drinking in Midlife Before Versus During the COVID-19 Crisis: Longitudinal Evidence From the United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions may have influenced alcohol consumption. This study examines changes in high-risk alcohol consumption from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in an established cohort of middle-aged British adults., METHODS: Participants consisted of 3,358 middle-aged adults from the 1970 British Cohort Study who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for detecting hazardous drinkers in primary care settings in 2016-2018 (when aged 46-48 years) and May 2020 (aged 50 years). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in high-risk drinking (scores of >=5), and multinomial regression was used to compare responses with individual test items in 2016-2018 and May 2020., RESULTS: Among middle-aged British adults, high-risk drinking increased by 5.2 percentage points from 19.4% to 24.6% (p <0.001) between 2016-2018 and May 2020. The increase in high-risk drinking was not moderated by sex, marital status, educational attainment, the presence of a chronic illness, or the year the baseline survey was completed. The prevalence of drinking >=4 times a week doubled from 12.5% to 26% from before to during the pandemic (p<0.001), and there was also evidence of an increase in the frequency of being unable to stop drinking., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence linking the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown restrictions to an increase in high-risk drinking patterns and particularly frequent drinking in British adults. Potential long-term changes in drinking habits should be monitored following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2020 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

0	Correlating arterial blood gas, acid-base and blood pressure abnormalities with outcomes in COVID-19 intensive care patients. Background: During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many studies have investigated laboratory biomarkers in management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients, however to date, few have investigated arterial blood gas, acid-base and blood pressure patterns. The aim of the study is to assess the arterial blood gas and acid-base patterns, blood pressure findings and their association with the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Method(s): A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated COVID-19 intensive care unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, renal function and blood pressure readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26 March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Result(s): A total of 56 intensive care unit patients had admission arterial blood gas performed at the time of intensive care unit admission. An alkalaemia (pH > 7.45) was observed in 36 (64.3%) patients. A higher arterial pH (median 7.48 [interquartile range: 7.45-7.51] versus 7.46 [interquartile range: 7.40-7.48], P = 0.049) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (median 7.9 kPa [interquartile range: 7.3-9.6] versus 6.5 kPa [interquartile range: 5.2-7.3], P = <0.001) were significantly associated with survival. Survivors also tended to have a higher systolic blood pressure (median: 144 mmHg [interquartile range: 134-152] versus 139 mmHg [interquartile range: 125-142], P = 0.078) and higher arterial HCO3 (median: 28.0 mmol/L [interquartile range: 25.7-28.8] versus 26.3 mmol/L [interquartile range: 24.3-27.9], P = 0.059). Conclusion(s): The majority of the study population admitted to intensive care unit had an alkalaemia on arterial blood gas. A higher pH and lower partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on arterial blood gas analysis were significantly associated with survival.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false

0	Who's Skeptical of Vaccines? Prevalence and Determinants of Anti-Vaccination Attitudes in Italy. This paper investigates negative attitudes toward vaccines in Italy, where anti-vaccination movements have gained significant momentum in recent years. Considering the substantial health risk to herd immunity the issue poses, particularly after the sudden outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly urgent to study the prevalence and diffusion of anti-vaccination beliefs. Using data from the 2016 European Social Survey's (ESS) country specific questions for Italy, the prevalence of anti-vaccination attitudes is examined along with how they are influenced by demographic, attitudinal and value-oriented determinants. The results show that 15 percent of the Italian public strictly hold negative views toward vaccination, and the prevalence of anti-vaccination attitudes is most commonly found among those who are less educated and aged between 25 and 34. While religiosity and political conservatism do not have an effect on antivaccination beliefs, our results indicate a strong positive link between anti-vaccination attitudes and distrust in the country's health-care systems and political institutions.	false

0	Possible Early Vertical Transmission of COVID-19 from an Infected Pregnant Female to Her Neonate: A Case Report. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-19) has emerged as a public health emergency in recent times. The reported data on the mode of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are largely through contact, droplet, airborne and fomite transmission methods with vertical transmission being a rare entity. We hereby report a case of a probable vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-19 from an infected pregnant female to her neonate. The transmission has been confirmed by a positive RT-PCR at 16 h of life along with a positive IgG antibody test for SARS-CoV-19 in the baby and after excluding the possible environmental contamination of the sample. The baby was asymptomatic during the course of hospital stay and was discharged from the facility on Day 9 of life. Copyright © The Author(s) [2020]. Published by Oxford University Press.

0	Current methods for diagnosis of human coronaviruses: pros and cons. The current global fight against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to flatten the transmission curve is put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) as there is no immediate diagnosis or cure for COVID-19 so far. In order to stop the spread, researchers worldwide are working around the clock aiming to develop reliable tools for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) understanding the infection path and mechanisms. Currently, nucleic acid-based molecular diagnosis (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test) is considered the gold standard for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody-based serology detection is ineffective for the purpose of early diagnosis, but a potential tool for serosurveys, providing people with immune certificates for clearance from COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, there are various blooming methods developed these days. In this review, we summarise different types of coronavirus discovered which can be transmitted between human beings. Methods used for diagnosis of the discovered human coronavirus (SARS, MERS, COVID-19) including nucleic acid detection, gene sequencing, antibody detection, antigen detection, and clinical diagnosis are presented. Their merits, demerits and prospects are discussed which can help the researchers to develop new generation of advanced diagnostic tools for accurate and effective control of human coronavirus transmission in the communities and hospitals.	false
0	Design and rationale of the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium international, multicentre, observational study. INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data that can be used to guide the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. In response, a research and data-sharing collaborative-The COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium-has been assembled to harness the cumulative experience of intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights crucial to improving outcomes., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multicentre, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on 1 January 2020 and currently includes >350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrols patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium/Short Period Incidence Study of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Local principal investigators will ensure that the study adheres to all relevant national regulations, and that the necessary approvals are in place before a site may contribute data. In jurisdictions where a waiver of consent is deemed insufficient, prospective, representative or retrospective consent will be obtained, as appropriate. A web-based dashboard has been developed to provide relevant data and descriptive statistics to international collaborators in real-time. It is anticipated that, following study completion, all de-identified data will be made open access., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12620000421932 (http://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000421932.aspx).

0	In-silico study of the inhibitory effect of some flavonoids compounds and their derivatives on SARSCOV-2. The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 forms a big threat to all people in the world around us. In Iraq, there is a direct increase in the incidence, with a slight decrease in the mortality rate, and that leads us to attempt to find any way to stop or lessen the virus's harmful symptoms. In the current study, we used molecular docking to detect the probable inhibitory effect of fifteen natural compounds of some Flavonoids and their derivatives and two antiviral drugs against two of very important SARS-COV-2 proteins the papain like protease (PLpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that was performed using Molecular Operating Environment software(MOE). All the chosen flavonoids and their derivatives, plus the two antiviral drugs docked in the active sites of the viral proteins (PLpro), some of the natural flavonoids like Glycitein 7-O-glucuronide and Theaflavin, gives energy complex scores about-6.96308947 and-6.99058199 Kcal/mol which is better than the energy score is given by Sofosbuvir and Darunavir-6.81020832 and-6.93942785 Kcal/mol respectively. And the docking of the compounds into the active sites of (RdRp) protein gives energy binding scores for Theaflavin monogallate-7.84163618 kcal/mol and that better than the complex's score given by docking of the Sofosbuvir and Darunavir into the same protein which gives-7.30999422 and-7.67598867 kcal/mol respectively. That's mean these flavonoids and their derivatives can be used as COVID-19 treatment. Otherwise, the infected people with COVID-19 can consume food rich with these Flavonoids to inhibit the virus or at least decrease its symptoms. Also from docking of flavonoids into both viral proteins, we can notice that all-natural compounds reported energy binding scores, and the Flavonoid derivatives have a better energy binding score than flavonoid themselves.Copyright © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

0	Chinese Residents' Perceptions of COVID-19 During the Pandemic: Online Cross-sectional Survey Study. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has posed a global threat due to substantial morbidity and mortality, and health education strategies need to be adjusted accordingly to prevent a possible epidemic rebound. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 among individuals coming to, returning to, or living in Jiangsu Province, China, and determine the impact of the pandemic on the perceptions of the public. METHOD(S): In this study, an online questionnaire was distributed to participants between February 15 and April 21, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on personal information (eg, sex, age, educational level, and occupation); protection knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to COVID-19; access to COVID-19-related information; and current information needs. Factors influencing the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score for COVID-19 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) and its 95% credible interval were calculated and compared with the daily participation number and protection scores. RESULT(S): In total, 52,066 participants were included in the study; their average knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were 25.58 (SD 4.22), 24.05 (SD 4.02), 31.51 (SD 2.84), and 90.02 (SD 8.87), respectively, and 65.91% (34,315/52,066) had a total protection score above 90 points. For the knowledge and skill sections, correct rates of answers to questions on medical observation days, infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, cough or sneeze treatment, and precautions were higher than 95%, while those of questions on initial symptoms (32,286/52,066, 62.01%), transmission routes (37,134/52,066, 71.32%), selection of disinfection products (37,390/52,066, 71.81%), and measures of home quarantine (40,037/52,066, 76.90%) were relatively low. For the actual behavior section, 97.93% (50,989/52,066) of participants could wear masks properly when going out. However, 19.76% (10,290/52,066) could not disinfect their homes each week, and 18.42% (9589/52,066) could not distinguish differences in initial symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19. The regression analyses showed that the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were influenced by sex, age, educational level, occupation, and place of residence at different degrees (P<.001). The government, television shows, and news outlets were the main sources of protection knowledge, and the information released by the government and authoritative medical experts was considered the most reliable. The current information needs included the latest epidemic developments, disease treatment progress, and daily protection knowledge. The Rt in the Jiangsu Province and mainland China dropped below 1, while the global Rt remained at around 1. The maximal information coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that the public's perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic. CONCLUSION(S): A high proportion of the participants had sufficient COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. Thus, it is necessary to apply different health education measures tailored to work and study resumption for specific populations to improve their self-protection and, ultimately, to prevent a possible rebound of COVID-19.Copyright ©Tingting Cui, Guoping Yang, Lili Ji, Lin Zhu, Shiqi Zhen, Naiyang Shi, Yan Xu, Hui Jin.

0	Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in middle-aged patients without comorbidities: a multicentre retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Information regarding characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 amongst middle-aged (40-59 years) patients without comorbidities is scarce., METHODS: We therefore conducted this multicentre retrospective study and collected data of middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities at admission from three designated hospitals in China., RESULTS: Among 119 middle-aged patients without comorbidities, 18 (15.1%) developed into severe illness and 5 (3.9%) died in hospital. ARDS (26, 21.8%) and elevated D-dimer (36, 31.3%) were the most common complications, while other organ complications were relatively rare. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe illness associated with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, OR, 11.238; 95% CI 1.110-1.382; p < 0.001) and D-dimer greater than 1 microg/ml (OR, 16.079; 95% CI 3.162-81.775; p = 0.001) on admission. The AUCs for the NLR, D-dimer greater than 1 microg/ml and combined NLR and D-dimer index were 0.862 (95% CI, 0.751-0.973), 0.800 (95% CI 0.684-0.915) and 0.916 (95% CI, 0.855-0.977), respectively. SOFA yielded an AUC of 0.750 (95% CI 0.602-0.987). There was significant difference in the AUC between SOFA and combined index (z = 2.574, p = 0.010)., CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to the monitoring and early treatment of respiratory and coagulation abnormalities in middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities. In addition, the combined NLR and D-dimer higher than 1 mug/ml index might be a potential and reliable predictor for the incidence of severe illness in this specific patient with COVID-19, which could guide clinicians on early classification and management of patients, thereby relieving the shortage of medical resource. However, it is warranted to validate the reliability of the predictor in larger sample COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Recombinant vaccines for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has imposed a major public health threat, which needs effective therapeutics and vaccination strategies. Several potential candidate vaccines being rapidly developed are in clinical evaluation. Considering the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein in virus attachment, entry, and induction of neutralizing antibodies, S protein is being widely used as a target for vaccine development. Based on advances in techniques for vaccine design, inactivated, live-vectored, nucleic acid, and recombinant COVID-19 vaccines are being developed and tested for their efficacy. Phase3 clinical trials are underway or will soon begin for several of these vaccines. Assuming that clinical efficacy is shown for one or more vaccines, safety is a major aspect to be considered before deploying such vaccines to the public. The current review focuses on the recent advances in recombinant COVID-19 vaccine research and development and associated issues.	false
0	Genomic diversity and evolution, diagnosis, prevention, and therapeutics of the pandemic COVID-19 disease. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by a novel evolutionarily divergent RNA virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently spreaded around the world. Genomic analyses revealed that this zoonotic virus may be evolved naturally but not a purposefully manipulated laboratory construct. However, currently available data are not sufficient to precisely conclude the origin of this fearsome virus. Comprehensive annotations of the whole-genomes revealed hundreds of nucleotides, and amino acids mutations, substitutions and/or deletions at different positions of the ever changing SARS-CoV-2 genome. The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses a functional polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary through the insertion of 12 nucleotides. It leads to the predicted acquisition of 3-O-linked glycan around the cleavage site. Although real-time RT-PCR methods targeting specific gene(s) have widely been used to diagnose the COVID-19 patients, however, recently developed more convenient, cheap, rapid, and specific diagnostic tools targeting antigens or CRISPR-Cas-mediated method or a newly developed plug and play method should be available for the resource-poor developing countries. A large number of candidate drugs, vaccines and therapies have shown great promise in early trials, however, these candidates of preventive or therapeutic agents have to pass a long path of trials before being released for the practical application against COVID-19. This review updates current knowledge on origin, genomic evolution, development of the diagnostic tools, and the preventive or therapeutic remedies of the COVID-19. We also discussed the future scopes for research, effective management, and surveillance of the newly emerged COVID-19 disease.Copyright 2020 Hoque et al.	false
0	Quantum leap of monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovery and development in the COVID-19 era. In recent years the global market for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) became a multi-billion-dollar business. This success is mainly driven by treatments in the oncology and autoimmune space. Instead, development of effective mAbs against infectious diseases has been lagging behind. For years the high production cost and limited efficacy have blocked broader application of mAbs in the infectious disease space, which instead has been dominated for almost a century by effective and cheap antibiotics and vaccines. Only very few mAbs against RSV, anthrax, Clostridium difficile or rabies have reached the market. This is about to change. The development of urgently needed and highly effective mAbs as preventive and therapeutic treatments against a variety of pathogens is gaining traction. Vast advances in mAb isolation, engineering and production have entirely shifted the cost-efficacy balance. MAbs against devastating diseases like Ebola, HIV and other complex pathogens are now within reach. This trend is further accelerated by ongoing or imminent health crises like COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), where antibodies could be the last resort. In this review we will retrace the history of antibodies from the times of serum therapy to modern mAbs and lay out how the current run for effective treatments against COVID-19 will lead to a quantum leap in scientific, technological and health care system innovation around mAb treatments for infectious diseases.

0	COVID-19 Infection: Data Gaps for Diagnostic Laboratory Preparedness and Tasks on Hand. Emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) and its spread, with life-threatening outcomes, have caused a pandemic burden worldwide. Studies of emerging diseases under outbreak conditions have focused on the complete spectrum of pathogens, transmissibility, shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity, epidemiological causes, and interventions to control emergence. During the initial stages of an outbreak, laboratory response capacity focuses on expansion of efficient diagnostic tools for rapid case detection, contact tracing, putting epidemiological findings into sources, mode of transmission, and identification of susceptible groups and reservoirs. It is important for public health diagnostic laboratories to have a fundamental knowledge of viral shedding, antibody response kinetics, assay validation, interpretation, and uncertainties of test results. This study reviewed currently published data from available literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared this with data on viral shedding and antibody response kinetics of other human coronaviruses. Also described are current challenges and comments on some biases and significant data gaps that have limited laboratory preparedness to SARS-CoV-2. Consistent documentation of progress and data gaps from standardized reporting of methods utilized, sampling date, details of test results by specimen type, risk assessments, and symptoms can all be used strategically and provide incentives to governments and their partners to prioritize the development, detection, and response to outbreaks.	false
0	How to get away with COVID-19: endoscopy during post-peak pandemic. A perspective review. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed the way we work, and health care services have to adapt. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the delay of non-urgent procedures were the immediate measures adopted by Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy Units at the time of crisis. As the peak has now passed in most countries, GI facilities are facing the next challenge of this pandemic: service providers must adapt their routine work to a 'new normal'. Routine casework must resume, and waiting lists must be addressed: all in the awareness of the ongoing potential risks of COVID-19, and the threat of a second wave. In this review, we discuss strategies to manage the workload by improving procedure appropriateness and prioritization, whilst maintaining a 'COVID-free' environment. This includes monitoring of an adequate stock of PPE and the implications for the staff's workload, and the GI trainees' need of training.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.	false

0	Persistent Detection and Infectious Potential of SARS-CoV-2 Virus in Clinical Specimens from COVID-19 Patients. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in December 2019 as the causative agent of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 has several distinctive features, including extensive multiorgan involvement with a robust systemic inflammatory response, significant associated morbidity and mortality, and prolonged persistence of viral RNA in the clinical specimens of infected individuals as detected by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. This review begins with an overview of SARS-CoV-2 morphology and replication and summarizes what is known to date about the detection of the virus in nasal, oropharyngeal, and fecal specimens of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, with a focus on the factors thought to contribute to prolonged detection. This review also provides a discussion on the infective potential of this material from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and convalescing individuals, to include a discussion of the relative persistence and infectious potential of virus in clinical specimens recovered from pediatric COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Risk factors associated with adverse fetal outcomes in pregnancies affected by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A secondary analysis of the WAPM study on COVID-19. To evaluate the strength of association between maternal and pregnancy characteristics and the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnancies with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Secondary analysis of a multinational, cohort study on all consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 from 73 centers from 22 different countries. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite adverse fetal outcome, defined as the presence of either abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestations), stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 22 weeks of gestation), neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within the first 28 days of life), and perinatal death (either stillbirth or neonatal death). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate parameters independently associated with the primary outcome. Logistic regression was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30.6+/-9.5 weeks, with 8.0% of women being diagnosed in the first, 22.2% in the second and 69.8% in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were six miscarriage (2.3%), six intrauterine device (IUD) (2.3) and 5 (2.0%) neonatal deaths, with an overall rate of perinatal death of 4.2% (11/265), thus resulting into 17 cases experiencing and 226 not experiencing composite adverse fetal outcome. Neither stillbirths nor neonatal deaths had congenital anomalies found at antenatal or postnatal evaluation. Furthermore, none of the cases experiencing IUD had signs of impending demise at arterial or venous Doppler. Neonatal deaths were all considered as prematurity-related adverse events. Of the 250 live-born neonates, one (0.4%) was found positive at RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs performed after delivery. The mother was tested positive during the third trimester of pregnancy. The newborn was asymptomatic and had negative RT-PCR test after 14 days of life. At logistic regression analysis, gestational age at diagnosis (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.8-0.9 per week increase; p<0.001), birthweight (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.12.7 per 100 g decrease; p=0.012) and maternal ventilatory support, including either need for oxygen or CPAP (OR: 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.9; p=0.001) were independently associated with composite adverse fetal outcome. Early gestational age at infection, maternal ventilatory supports and low birthweight are the main determinants of adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses with maternal COVID-19 infection. Conversely, the risk of vertical transmission seems negligible. Copyright © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.	false
0	A Novel Diffusion-Based Model for Estimating Cases, and Fatalities in Epidemics: The Case of COVID-19. While the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in a majority of countries, a wealth of literature published in reputable journals attempted to model the spread of the disease. A vast majority of these studies dealt with compartmental models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Although these models are rather simple, intuitive, and insightful, we argue that they do not necessarily provide a good enough fit to the reported data, which are usually reported in the form of daily fatalities and cases during pandemics. This study proposes an alternative analytics approach that relies on diffusion models to predict the number of cases and fatalities in epidemics. After evaluating several of the well-known and widely used diffusion models in business literature, including ADBUDG, Gompertz, and Bass models, we developed and used a modified/improved version of the original Bass diffusion model to address the shortcomings of the ordinary compartmental models such as SIR and demonstrated its applicability on the portrayal of the COVID-19 pandemic incident data. The proposed model differentiates itself from other similar models by fitting the data without the need for preprocessing, requiring no initial conditions and assumptions, not involving in heavy parameterization, and also properly addressing the pressing issues such as undocumented cases, length of infectious or recovery periods.

0	A modelling study highlights the power of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or very mildly affected individuals for COVID-19 epidemic management. BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is a powerful tool for the design of management policies and a fundamental part of the arsenal currently deployed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: We present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentina's parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere., RESULTS: Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for complete lockdown, and Mendoza's healthcare system would not collapse., CONCLUSIONS: Our model and its analysis inform that the detection and isolation of all infected individuals, without leaving aside the asymptomatic group is the key to surpass this pandemic.	false
0	COVID-19 and Tuberculosis-Related Catastrophic Costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented health crisis and a substantial socioeconomic impact. It also affects tuberculosis (TB) control severely worldwide. Interruptions of many TB control programs because of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant setbacks. One of the targets that can be affected is the WHO's End TB Strategy goal to eliminate catastrophic costs of TB-affected households by 2030. Disruptions to TB programs and healthcare services due to COVID-19 could potentially prolong diagnostic delays and worsen TB treatment adherence and outcomes. The economic recession caused by the pandemic could significantly impact household financial capacity because of the reduction of income and the rise in unemployment rates. All of these factors increase the risk of TB incidence and the gravity of economic impact on TB-affected households, and hamper efforts to eliminate catastrophic costs and control TB. Therefore, efforts to eliminate the incidence of TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs will be very challenging. Because financial constraint plays a significant role in TB control, the improvement of health and social protection systems is critical. Even before the pandemic, many TB-high-burden countries (HBCs) lacked robust health and social protection systems. These challenges highlight the substantial need for a more robust engagement of patients and civil society organizations and international support in addressing the consequences of COVID-19 on the control of TB.	false
0	A case-control emergency department-based analysis of acute pancreatitis in Covid-19: Results of the UMC-19-S6. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients with COVID-19 attending the emergency department (ED), before hospitalization., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with AP in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-AP) during the COVID outbreak. We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes., RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.94). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%. Twenty-six clinical characteristics of COVID patients were associated with a higher risk of developing AP: abdominal pain (OR=59.4, 95%CI=23.7-149), raised blood amylase (OR=31.8; 95%CI=1.60-632) and vomiting (OR=15.8, 95%CI=6.69-37.2) being the strongest, and some inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelets, D-dimer) were more increased. Compared to non-COVID-AP, COVID-AP patients differed in 23 variables; the strongest ones related to COVID symptoms, but less abdominal pain was reported, pancreatic enzymes raise was lower, and severity (estimated by BISAP and SOFA score at ED arrival) was higher. The in-hospital mortality (adjusted for age and sex) of COVID-AP did not differ from COVID-non-AP (OR=1.12, 95%CI=0.45-245) but was higher than non-COVID-AP (OR=2.46, 95%CI=1.35-4.48)., CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis as presenting form of COVID-19 in the ED is unusual (<1 cases). Some clinically distinctive characteristics are present compared to the remaining COVID patients and can help to identify this unusual manifestation. In-hospital mortality of COVID-AP does not differ from COVID-non-AP but is higher than non-COVID-AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.

0	Clinical Characteristics, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Major Coronavirus Outbreaks. Human coronavirus infections have been known to cause mild respiratory illness. It changed in the last two decades as three global outbreaks by coronaviruses led to significant mortality and morbidity. SARS CoV-1 led to the first epidemic of the twenty first century due to coronavirus. SARS COV-1 infection had a broad array of symptoms with respiratory and gastrointestinal as most frequent. The last known case was reported in 2004. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) led to the second outbreak in 2012, and case fatality was much higher than SARS. MERS-CoV has a wide array of clinical presentations from mild, moderate to severe, and some patients end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The third and recent outbreak by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019, which lead to a global pandemic. Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection can be asymptomatic or have a range of symptoms with fever, cough, and shortness of breath being most common. Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a diagnostic test of choice for SARS CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2 infections. This review aims to discuss epidemiological, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of human coronaviruses with a focus on SARS CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2.

0	Epidemiology of COVID-19. COVID-19, an infectious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2), has now spread to multiple countries including India. The pace at which the disease spread in the last 4 months, since it was first recognized from China, is unprecedented. This review of the epidemiology of COVID-19 summarizes the burden of infection, transmission dynamics, and other related epidemiological features. While countries such as China, Italy, and the United States have particularly high-rates of infection, the disease is gradually spreading in India as well, threatening the health and economy of the country. Transmission in asymptomatic cases, early symptomatic phase, as well as limited access to testing in different settings are factors that have led to the rapid spread of infection. A large case series from China revealed that 81% of cases had mild symptoms, 14% had severe disease, and 5% were afflicted with critical illness. While the mortality in China was reported as 2.3%, Italy, with a high-proportion of elderly, reported a case fatality report of 7.2% due to higher infection and mortality rates among the elderly. Being a highly infectious disease, with a basic reproduction number between 2 to 3, COVID-19 is affecting a large number of healthcare workers, as evidenced by the fact that a sizeable portion of reported infections in the US included healthcare workers. Delivering health care for both COVID-19 affected individuals, as well those with other acute and chronic conditions, with limited access to healthcare facilities and services, are challenges for the health systems in low- A nd middle-income countries, which require immediate measures for health system strengthening across sectors.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

0	Update on the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in March 2020, affecting millions of people worldwide. However, COVID-19 in pediatric patients represents 1-5% of all cases, and the risk for developing severe disease and critical illness is much lower in children with COVID-19 than in adults. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a possible complication of COVID-19, has been described as a hyperinflammatory condition with multiorgan involvement similar to that in Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome in children with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review presents an update on the diagnostic methods for COVID-19, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, serology tests, and imaging, and summarizes the current recommendations for the management of the disease. Particular emphasis is placed on respiratory support, which includes noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation strategies according to lung compliance and pattern of lung injury. Pharmacological treatment, including pathogen-targeted drugs and host-directed therapies, has been addressed. The diagnostic criteria and management of MIS-C are also summarized.	false
0	First-in-man craniectomy and asportation of solitary cerebellar metastasis in COVID-19 patient: A case report. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has an impact on the delivery of neurosurgical care, and it is changing the perioperative practice worldwide. We present the first case in the literature of craniectomy procedure and asportation of a solitary cerebellar metastasis of the oesophagus squamous carcinoma in a 77 years old woman COVID-19 positive. In these particular circumstances, we show that adequate healthcare resources and risk assessments are essential in the management of COVID-19 patients referred to emergency surgery., Presentation of case: The case here presented was treated in 2019 for squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus. In April 2020, she presented a deterioration of her clinical picture consisting of dysphagia, abdominal pain, hyposthenia and ataxia. A Head CT scan was performed, which showed the presence of a solitary cerebellar metastasis. Her associated SARS-CoV-2 positivity status represented the principal clinical concern throughout her hospitalisation., Discussion: The patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy procedure with metastasis asportation. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre- and post-operative phases, but she was not admitted to the intensive care unit because she did not present any respiratory complications. Her vital parameters and inflammation indexes fell within the reference ranges, and she was kept in isolation for 16 days in our neurosurgical unit following strict COVID-19 measures. She was asymptomatic and not treated for any of the specific and non-specific symptoms of COVID-19., Conclusion: This is the first case reported of solitary cerebellar metastasis of oesophagus carcinoma operated on a COVID-19 positive patient. It shows that asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients can undergo major emergency surgeries without the risk of infecting the operating team if adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is used. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not develop the disease's active phase despite undergoing a stressful event such as a major emergency neurosurgical procedure. In the current crisis, a prophylactic COVID-19 screening test can identify asymptomatic patients undergoing major emergency surgery and adequate resource planning and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers can minimise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	SARS-CoV-2-induced immune activation and death of monocyte-derived human macrophages and dendritic cells. Studies of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and experimentally infected animals indicate a critical role for augmented expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in severe disease. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) was abortive, but induced the production of multiple antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10) and a chemokine (CXCL10). Despite the lack of efficient replication in MDMs, SARS-CoV-2 induced profound IFN-mediated cell death of host cells. Macrophage activation and death was not enhanced by exposure to low levels of convalescent plasma, suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement of infection does not contribute to cell death. Together, these results indicate that infection of macrophages and dendritic cells potentially plays a major role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, even in the absence of productive infection.

0	Pre-Hospital Management of Critically Ill Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Retrospective Multicenter Study. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak had a major impact on healthcare systems worldwide. Our study aims to describe the characteristics and therapeutic emergency mobile service (EMS) management of patients with vital distress due to COVID-19, their in-hospital care pathway and their in-hospital outcome., METHODS: This retrospective and multicentric study was conducted in the six main centers of the French Greater East region, an area heavily impacted by the pandemic. All patients requiring EMS dispatch and who were admitted straight to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Clinical data from their pre-hospital and hospital management were retrieved., RESULTS: We included a total of 103 patients (78.6% male, median age 68). In the initial stage, patients were in a critical condition (median oxygen saturation was 72% (60-80%)). In the field, 77.7% (CI 95%: 71.8-88.3%) were intubated. Almost half of our population (45.6%, CI 95%: 37.1-56.9%) had clinical Phenotype 1 (silent hypoxemia), while the remaining half presented Phenotype 2 (acute respiratory failure). In the ICU, a great number had ARDS (77.7%, CI 95% 71.8-88.3% with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200). In-hospital mortality was 33% (CI 95%: 24.6-43.3%). The two phenotypes showed clinical and radiological differences (respiratory rate, OR = 0.98, p = 0.02; CT scan lesion extension >50%, OR = 0.76, p < 0.03). However, no difference was found in terms of overall in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.07, p = 0.74)., CONCLUSION: The clinical phenotypes appear to be very distinguishable in the pre-hospital field, yet no difference was found in terms of mortality. This leads us to recommend an identical management in the initial phase, despite the two distinct presentations.	false
0	Maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2: A meta-analysis. Evidence concerning coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) in pregnancy is still scarce and scattered. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in covid-19 pregnancies and identify factors associated with perinatal viral transmission. Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched to 3 June 2020. Overall, 16 observational studies and 44 case reports/series were included. Fever was the most frequent maternal symptom, followed by cough and shortness of breath, while about 15 % of infected were asymptomatic. Severe disease was estimated to occur in 11 % of women in case reports/series and in 7 % (95 % CI: 4 %-10 %) in observational studies. Two maternal deaths were reported. The rate of neonatal transmission did not differ between women with and without severe disease (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 0.50-7.60). Preterm birth occurred in 29.7 % and 16 % (95 % CI: 11 %-21 %) in data obtained from case series and observational studies, respectively. Stillbirth occurred in 3 cases and 2 neonatal deaths were observed. Vertical transmission was suspected in 4 cases. Fever was the most common neonatal symptom (40 %), followed by shortness of breath (28 %) and vomiting (24 %), while 20 % of neonates were totally asymptomatic. In conclusion, the maternal and neonatal clinical course the infection is typically mild, presenting low mortality rates. The risk of vertical transmission is suggested to be low and may not be affected by the severity of maternal disease. Further large-scale studies are needed to clarify the risk factors associated with viral transmission and severe infection in the neonatal population. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	Characteristics and considerations in the medical treatment of COVID-19 in children. It is rare for children to be in serious condition or die from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) except for those with underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppressive disease. Recently, patients with hyperinflammatory shock have been identified among children who are confirmed to have or are suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presenting signs and symptoms are characterized by prolonged fever, abdominal pain, and cardiac involvement without any signs of pneumonia on chest computed tomography. However, it is uncertain at this time whether SARS-CoV-2 infection affects this syndrome. Compared to adults, quite a few children are asymptomatic even when infected with SARS-CoV-2, which could make these children serious sources of infection at home or in medical institutions. Considering these characteristics, it is important to take appropriate precautions during medical examinations and perform infection control in emergency departments to save the lives of both the children and adult patients. Most healthy children are suffering huge stress due to restrictions against going outside and school closures as social means to control infection. It is possible that children are socially isolated when they come to the emergency department, and they might require mental or social support even if they are only complaining about their physical condition. Healthcare providers are required to examine the children's circumstances carefully and cooperate with workers in other professions appropriately. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Proactive and blended approach for COVID-19 control in Taiwan. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the greatest threat to human society in a century. To better devise control strategies, policymakers should adjust policies based on scientific evidence in hand. Several countries have limited the epidemics of COVID-19 by prioritizing containment strategies to mitigate the impacts on public health and healthcare systems. However, asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 complicated traditional symptom-based approaches for disease control. In addition, drastic population-based interventions usually have significant societal and economic impacts. Therefore, in Taiwan, the containment strategies consisted of the more extended case-based interventions (e.g., case detection with enhanced surveillance and contact tracing with active monitoring and quarantine of close contacts) and more targeted population-based interventions (e.g., face mask use in recommended settings and risk-oriented border control with corresponding quarantine requirement). The success of the blended approach emphasizes not only the importance of evidence-supported policymaking but also the coordinated efforts between the government and the people. Copyright © 2020.

0	Elevated serum ferritin level effectively discriminates severity illness and liver injury of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. AIM: ferritin is a hepatic protein that plays vital roles in diagnosing and predicting diseases, but its potential in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown. Method: we collected clinical records from 79 COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union hospital (China). Spearman's correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were employed., RESULTS: patients with elevated ferritin levels had a higher incidence of severity illness (50.0% vs 2.9%) and liver injury (52.3% vs 20.0%) when compared with patients with normal ferritin levels (p < 0.05). Ferritin could effectively identify severity illness (ROC area 0.873) and liver injury (ROC area 0.752). Elevated ferritin group showed longer viral clearance time (median 16 vs 6 days, p < 0.001) and in-hospital length (median 18 vs 10 days, p < 0.001). Conclusions: it suggests that ferritin could act as an easy-to-use tool to identify liver injury and severity illness and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Intensive surveillance is necessary for patients with abnormal ferritin levels.	false
0	Ethical issues in the COVID-19 pandemic control preparedness in a developing economy. Adequate preparation for highly pathogenic infectious disease pandemic can reduce the incidence, prevalence and burden of diseases like COVID-19 pandemic. An antidote to the spread of the disease is adequate preparation for its control since there is no proven curative measure yet. Effective management of identified cases, social distancing, contact tracing and provision of basic infrastructure to facilitate compliance with preventive measures, testing are proven management strategies. Although these measures seem to be the best options presently, it is important to pay attention to ethical issues arising from the implementation process to ensure best practice. While disease epidemic is not alien to human societies, lessons from previous outbreaks are vital for addressing future outbreaks. For effective control of this pandemic, there should be a clear definition of social distancing in terms of distance and space in line with the WHO definition, adequate provision of basic amenities, screening and testing with specific criteria for selecting those to be screened. Also, there should be a free testing procedure, access to treatment opportunities for those who test positive, ethical free contact tracing practice, respect for the autonomy of those to be tested, and global best practice of open science, open data and data sharing practices. In conclusion, a framework/guideline for epidemic/pandemic ethics guidance should be developed while an ethical sensitive communication manual should be prepared for public engagement on epidemic and pandemic.Copyright © Ayodele Jegede et al.	false

0	Upper airway involvement in pediatric COVID-19. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mixed. It ranges from asymptomatic cases, medium-intensity forms with mild to moderate symptoms, to severe ones with bilateral lung involvement and respiratory distress, which can require transfer to ICUs and intubation. In most cases, the clinical picture is characterized by a persistent fever, cough, dyspnoea, expectoration, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, nasal congestion, and pharyngodynia. The spread of COVID-19 in Europe has highlighted an atypical presentation of disease involving upper airways and, above all, dysfunction of olfactory and gustatory senses. There is ample evidence that COVID-19 is significantly less severe in children than in adults. However, due to difficulties in assessing the disorder in children, especially among very young patients, the olfaction and gustatory dysfunctions remain open issues. This article sheds light on the upper airway involvement in pediatric COVID-19 subjects.Copyright © 2020 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Approaches towards fighting the COVID-19 pandemic (Review). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which has caused >46 millions confirmed infections and >1.2 million coronavirus related deaths, is one of the most devastating worldwide crises in recent years. Infection with COVID-19 results in a fever, dry cough, general fatigue, respiratory symptoms, diarrhoea and a sore throat, similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel coronavirus strain. To date, remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for use in the management of infection. Additionally, several efficient diagnostic tools are being actively developed, and novel drugs and vaccines are being evaluated for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against COVID-19, or in the prevention of infection. The present review highlights the prevalent clinical manifestations of COVID-19, characterizes the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequence and life cycle, highlights the optimal methods for preventing viral transmission, and discusses possible molecular pharmacological mechanisms and approaches in the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents. In addition, the use of traditional Chinese medicines for management of COVID-19 is discussed. It is expected that novel anti-viral agents, vaccines or an effective combination therapy for treatment/management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread therapy will be developed and implemented in 2021, and we would like to extend our best regards to the frontline health workers across the world in their fight against COVID-19.	false

0	Delirium Incidence, Duration, and Severity in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019. Objectives: To determine delirium occurrence rate, duration, and severity in patients admitted to the ICU with coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Retrospective data extraction study from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020. Delirium outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days in ICU., Setting: Two large, academic centers serving the state of Indiana., Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020, were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any delirium assessments, or without discharge disposition were excluded., Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were delirium rates and duration, and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Two-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the analysis with a mean age of 58.4 years (sd, 15.6 yr), 40.3% were female, 44.4% African American, 20.7% Hispanic, and a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 18 (interquartile range, 13-25). Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients, delirium prior to coma in 27.9%, and delirium after coma in 23.1%. The first Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU assessment was positive for delirium in 61.9%. Hypoactive delirium was the most common subtype (87.4%). By day 14, the median number of delirium/coma-free were 5 days (interquartile range, 4-11 d), and median Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 score was 6.5 (interquartile range, 5-7) indicating severe delirium. Benzodiazepines were ordered for 78.4% of patients in the cohort. Mechanical ventilation was associated with greater odds of developing delirium (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.1-22.2; p = 0.033) even after adjusting for sedative medications. There were no between-group differences in mortality., Conclusions: Delirium without coma occurred in 29.1% of patients admitted to the ICU. Delirium persisted for a median of 5 days and was severe. Mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with odds of delirium even after adjustment for sedatives. Clinical attention to manage delirium duration and severity, and deeper understanding of the virus' neurologic effects is needed for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

0	The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dental practice in Iran: a questionnaire-based report. BACKGROUND: The highly contagious nature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), besides the fact that dental procedures commonly generate blood and saliva droplets that could lead to the contagion have resulted in the closure of many dental clinics. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental practice by conducting an online questionnaire among the Iranian dental practitioners and finding their perspectives on the subject., METHODS: This report is based on a questionnaire that was conducted among Iranian dentists. The survey included questions that evaluate the dentists' perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their personal life, financial status, and the quality of dental services for patients., RESULTS: Overall, 240 dentists contributed to this study (214 general dentists and 26 specialists). The majority of the participants (n = 170, 70%) did not perform non-emergency procedures during the pandemic. The dental practitioners have suggested several strategies to decrease the risk of contagion, such as reducing treatment sessions (n = 90, 37%), strict triage of patients (n = 156, 64%), and using personal protective equipment (n = 108, 45%). However, most of the dentists (n = 210, 87%) had problems, providing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Moreover, 97% (n = 234) of the participants reported that they encountered a decrease in their financial income since the eruption of the pandemic., CONCLUSION: Dental health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, dental practitioners ought to execute the standard protocols more cautiously during the pandemic. They could also lower their work hours and limit dental procedures to emergency treatments to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Besides, the public organizations should provide proper equipment for the dental practitioners to decrease the risk of contagion.	false
0	Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome: a retrospective matched case-control study, Paris, France, April to May 2020. We assessed the association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Kawasaki disease (KD)-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in a retrospective case-control study in France. RT-PCR and serological tests revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 17/23 cases vs 11/102 controls (matched odds ratio: 26.4; 95% confidence interval: 6.0-116.9), indicating strong association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and KD-like illness. Clinicians should keep a high level of suspicion for KD-like illness during the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Amotosalen and ultraviolet A light treatment efficiently inactivates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human plasma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma and platelet products from asymptomatic blood donors, raising concerns about potential risk of transfusion transmission, also in the context of the current therapeutic approach utilizing plasma from convalescent donors. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of amotosalen/UVA light treatment to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma to reduce the risk of potential transmission through blood transfusion., METHODS: Pools of three whole-blood-derived human plasma units (630-650 ml) were inoculated with a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Spiked units were treated with amotosalen/UVA light (INTERCEPT Blood System TM) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Infectious titres and genomic viral load were assessed by plaque assay and real-time quantitative PCR. Inactivated samples were subject to three successive passages on permissive tissue culture to exclude the presence of replication-competent viral particles., RESULTS: Inactivation of infectious viral particles in spiked plasma units below the limit of detection was achieved by amotosalen/UVA light treatment with a mean log reduction of >3.32 +/- 0.2. Passaging of inactivated samples on permissive tissue showed no viral replication even after 9 days of incubation and three passages, confirming complete inactivation. The treatment also inhibited NAT detection by nucleic acid modification with a mean log reduction of 2.92 +/- 0.87 PFU genomic equivalents., CONCLUSION: Amotosalen/UVA light treatment of SARS-CoV-2 spiked human plasma units efficiently and completely inactivated >3.32 +/- 0.2 log of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, showing that such treatment could minimize the risk of transfusion-related SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

0	Whites' County-Level Racial Bias, COVID-19 Rates, and Racial Inequities in the United States. Mounting evidence reveals considerable racial inequities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the United States (US). Area-level racial bias has been associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, but its association with COVID-19 is yet unexplored. Combining county-level data from Project Implicit on implicit and explicit anti-Black bias among non-Hispanic Whites, Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, and The New York Times, we used adjusted linear regressions to estimate overall COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates through 01 July 2020, Black and White incidence rates through 28 May 2020, and Black-White incidence rate gaps on average area-level implicit and explicit racial bias. Across 2994 counties, the average COVID-19 mortality rate (standard deviation) was 1.7/10,000 people (3.3) and average cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate was 52.1/10,000 (77.2). Higher racial bias was associated with higher overall mortality rates (per 1 standard deviation higher implicit bias b = 0.65/10,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 0.91); explicit bias b = 0.49/10,000 (0.27, 0.70)) and higher overall incidence (implicit bias b = 8.42/10,000 (4.64, 12.20); explicit bias b = 8.83/10,000 (5.32, 12.35)). In 957 counties with race-specific data, higher racial bias predicted higher White and Black incidence rates, and larger Black-White incidence rate gaps. Anti-Black bias among Whites predicts worse COVID-19 outcomes and greater inequities. Area-level interventions may ameliorate health inequities.	false
0	Joint prevalence of physical activity and sitting time during COVID-19 among US adults in April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered much of US life with shifts to working-from-home and social distancing changing day-to-day behavior. We aimed to determine the self-reported prevalence of meeting US physical activity guidelines, stratified by sitting time during the early lockdown phase of COVID-19 in US adults. We conducted two cross-sectional internet-based studies April 3rd-May 4th, 2020 in convenience samples of US adults. Participants self-reported daily sitting time and weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) via questions from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A total of 5036 US adults (65.3% women, 30.2% with chronic conditions) provided complete physical activity and sitting time data (80.3% of total). Overall, 42.6% of participants reported sitting for > 8 h/day (95% CI: 41.2%-44.0%) and 72.5% (71.2%-73.7%) reported being either sufficiently (150-300 MVPA minutes) or highly active (>300 min). The greatest proportion of people self-reported being highly active and sitting for > 8 h/day (24.0%; 22.8%-25.2%), followed by being highly active and sitting for 6-8 h/day (20.9%; 19.8%-22.1%). Sitting and activity appeared similar between sexes, while there was evidence of some age differences. For example, more young adults (ages 18-34) appeared to self-report being inactive and more appeared to sit for > 8 h/day compared to older adults. High sitting time was reported by US adults (>40% sitting > 8 h/day) during April 2020. However, high levels of physical activity (>70% meeting guidelines) were also reported. Since physical activity cannot eliminate the negative health effects of sitting, maintaining activity and limiting sitting during periods of large workplace and societal shifts is encouraged.

0	"Mental wellbeing in the German old age population largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown: results of a representative survey. BACKGROUND: Older individuals are at increased risk of a severe and lethal course of COVID-19. They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing ('cocooning'), which has sparked much debate on the consequences for their mental wellbeing. We aimed to provide evidence by conducting a representative survey among the German old population during COVID-19 lockdown., METHODS: A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (n = 1005; age >= 65 years) during the first lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, overall psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory/BSI-18) and loneliness (UCLA 3-item loneliness scale). Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted., RESULTS: Participants were M = 75.5 (SD = 7.1) years old; 56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for M = 28.0 (SD = 4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean BSI-18 scores were 1.4 for depression, 1.6 for anxiety and 2.2 for somatization as well as 5.1 for global psychological distress. These figures did not indicate worse mental wellbeing, given normative values established by studies before the pandemic (2.0, 1.6, 2.4, 6.0, respectively). The prevalence of loneliness was 13.1%, which also fell within a range of estimates reported by studies before the pandemic. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental wellbeing. Resilience explained a large amount of variance., CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, the mental wellbeing of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of ""the weak and vulnerable older adults"" that were present during the pandemic. Long-term observations are needed to provide robust evidence."	false
0	Clinical characteristics and online mental health care of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Comparing to data in patients with severe coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), there are few studies on the prevalence anxiety and/or depression in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19. We investigated the clinical characteristics and the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and monitored their mental health using an online assessment. An online survey for monitoring and assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 using a mobile phone was conducted. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure anxiety and/or depression levels. Of the 234 patients, 66 patients were asymptomatic (28.2%), while the remaining 168 patients were mildly symptomatic. The prevalence of anosmia (p = 0.001) and ageusia (p = 0.008) significantly decreased with the increasing age. In addition, 19.8% and 14.0% patients had anxiety and/or depression in the first survey, and one week after the first survey, respectively. Compared to patients without anxiety and/or depression, those with anxiety and/or depression had a longer quarantine duration. We found that anomia and ageusia were relatively common in the young age group. Furthermore, one-fifth asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 had anxiety and/or depression.	false
0	COVID-19-Induced Acute Bilateral Optic Neuritis. A 44-year-old male patient with no past medical history presented 2 weeks after seropositive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection with vision problems suggestive of optic neuritis. Radiological testing showed findings suspicious for acute bilateral optic neuritis. The patient had also anti-MOG antibodies. Whether this was an optic neuritis due to COVID-19, MOG antibody disease, or an activation of MOG antibody disease by COVID-19 is discussed in this case.	false
0	Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare. Existing micronutrient deficiencies, even if only a single micronutrient, can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infectious disease. Certain population groups are more likely to have micronutrient deficiencies, while certain disease pathologies and treatment practices also exacerbate risk, meaning these groups tend to suffer increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Optimisation of overall nutritional status, including micronutrients, can be effective in reducing incidence of infectious disease. Micronutrient deficiencies are rarely recognised but are prevalent in the UK, as well as much more widely, particularly in high-risk groups susceptible to COVID-19. Practitioners should be aware of this fact and should make it a consideration for the screening process in COVID-19, or when screening may be difficult or impractical, to ensure blanket treatment as per the best practice guidelines. Correction of established micronutrient deficiencies, or in some cases assumed suboptimal status, has the potential to help support immune function and mitigate risk of infection. The effects of and immune response to COVID-19 share common characteristics with more well-characterised severe acute respiratory infections. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies has proven effective in several infectious diseases and has been shown to promote favourable clinical outcomes. Micronutrients appear to play key roles in mediating the inflammatory response and such effects may be enhanced through correction of deficiencies. Many of those at highest risk during the COVID-19 pandemic are also populations at highest risk of micronutrient deficiencies and poorer overall nutrition. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies in established COVID-19 infection may contribute to supporting immune response to infection in those at highest risk.

0	Evaluating Antibody Response Pattern in Asymptomatic virus infected Pregnant females: Human Well-Being Study. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infecting millions of people globally has given rise to serious public health threats. The need for early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in asymptomatic pregnant women is compelling to detect vertical transmission timely. Here, 11 SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic pregnant cases from Wuhan China were investigated. All the patients were initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR, so a chest CT scan was performed. Also, serum antibody (IgM and IgG) titers were estimated. CT scan of patients revealed typical abnormalities related to SARS-CoV-2, indicating ground-glass opacity and infection lesions suggesting viral pneumonia. Elevated IgM and IgG antibodies levels (p<0.001) were also noticed in infected patients. Hence, CT imaging and serum antibody response are valuable in the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic pregnant patients. These might serve as prognostic markers for healthcare professionals, in RT-PCR negative patients, to assess the effect of given treatment by chest CT. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Diabetes and Covid-19 among hospitalized patients in Saudi Arabia: a single-centre retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) is limited in the Arab region. This study aims to fill this gap., METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55 years; 68.3% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7%), DM (68.3%), hypertension (42.6%) and obesity (42.2%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5% versus 12.3%; p = 0.04) and lower survival time (p = 0.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.7-5.3); p < 0.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4-8.3); p = 0.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0-17.2); p < 0.001], beta-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0-2.9); p = 0.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1-3.3); p = 0.02], creatinine > 90 micromol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3-3.5); p = 0.004] and 25(OH)D < 12.5 nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7-28.2); p = 0.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose >= 11.1 mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.2); p = 0.04], as well as smoking, beta-blocker use, neutrophil > 7.5, creatinine > 90 micromol/l and alanine aminotransferase > 65U/l., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, beta-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome. Patients with acute metabolic dysfunctions, including hyperglycemia on admission are more likely to receive intensive care.	false
0	Convenience and comfort: reasons reported for using drugs alone among clients of harm reduction sites in British Columbia, Canada. BACKGROUND: North American communities are severely impacted by the overdose crisis, particularly in British Columbia (BC), which has the highest toxic drug overdose death rate in Canada. Most fatal overdoses in BC occurred among individuals using alone and in private residences. This study aimed to assess prevalence and reasons for using drugs alone among people accessing harm reduction services in BC., METHODS: We recruited harm reduction supply distribution site clients from 22 communities across BC. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to describe factors associated with using alone. Thematic analysis of free-text responses providing reasons for using alone were grouped with survey data and additional themes identified., RESULTS: Overall, 75.8% (n = 314) of the study sample (N = 414) reported using drugs alone within the last week. Those that reported using alone did not differ from those that did not by gender, age, urbanicity, or preferred drug use method. Among those that used alone, 73.2% (n = 230) used opioids, 76.8% (n = 241) used crystal meth, 41.4% (n = 130) used crack/cocaine, and 44.6% (n = 140) used alcohol in the past week. Polysubstance use involving stimulants, opioids, and/or benzodiazepines was reported by 68.5% (n = 215) of those that used alone. Additionally, 22.9% (n = 72) of those that used alone had experienced an opioid and/or stimulant overdose in the past 6 months. In a multivariable logistic regression model, having no regular housing and past week crack/cocaine use were associated with using alone (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.27; 95% CI 1.20-4.27 and AOR: 2.10; 95% CI 1.15-3.82, respectively). The most common reason reported for using alone was convenience and comfort of using alone (44.3%). Additional reasons included: stigma/hiding drug use (14.0%); having no one around (11.7%); safety (9.6%); and not wanting to share drugs with others (8.6%)., CONCLUSIONS: Using drugs alone, particularly for convenience and comfort, is ubiquitous among people accessing harm reduction services. Overdose prevention measures that go beyond individual behaviour changes, including providing a safer supply of drugs and eliminating stigma, are paramount to mitigate harms. These interventions are especially necessary as emergence of coronavirus disease may further exacerbate unpredictability of illicit drug content and overdose risk.	false
0	Risk Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Homeless Shelters in Chicago, Illinois-March-May, 2020. Background: People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters., Methods: We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors., Results: During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with >20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98)., Conclusions: We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Elevated cardiac troponin I as a predictor of outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalizations: a meta-analysis. Globally, coronavirus is causing more social, economic and healthcare disruption than expected. The emerging literature has reported the complications of coronavirus, and the mortality and risk factors involved, including cardiac injury and multisystem organ failure. In this meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the association of elevated troponin I levels with outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Observational studies describing troponin I levels and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 were identified. Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines with a consensus of two independent reviewers. Adverse outcomes were defined as admission to intensive care units (ICUs), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Ten studies with 3982 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. In patients with poor outcomes, the prevalence of elevated troponin I levels was 51% (690/1341). In meta-analysis, patients with elevated troponin I levels had higher odds of poor outcomes compared to better outcomes with pooled OR of 7.92 (95% CI: 3.70-16.97; p<0.00001) with 70% heterogeneity (p=0.0005). Our meta-analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients with elevated troponin I levels had a higher risk of poor outcomes. Hence, evaluating the troponin I levels might be helpful in preventing risk of cardiac complications and other organ dysfunction.	false

0	Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality are driven by unequal infection risks. BACKGROUND: As of November 1, 2020, there have been more than 230K deaths and 9M confirmed and probable cases attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic., METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks., RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates., CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.

0	SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but a type I, II and III interferon receptor independent mechanism. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection often caused severe end stage lung disease and organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage, especially in the elderly. The virus-host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown. To address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (Urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted SARS-CoV, designated rMA15. In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice. This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models. In contrast, infection of STAT1 -/- mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively. Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARSCoV infection in STAT1 -/- mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism. In contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that STAT1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation.	false
0	Effects of adjunct treatment with intravenous Octagam on the course of severe COVID-19: results from a retrospective cohort study. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of adjunct treatment with Octagam, an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) product, on clinical outcomes and biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: Data from a single center was analyzed retrospectively. Patients had received preliminary standard of intensive care (SIC) according to a local treatment algorithm, either alone or along with Octagam 5% at 30 g/day for 5 days. Both groups were compared regarding baseline characteristics, survival, and changes in inflammation markers. Imbalance in baseline APACHE II scores was addressed by propensity score matching. Otherwise, Kaplan-Meier and multiple logistic regression models were used. Results: Out of 93 patients, 51 had received Octagam and 42 had not. About 75% of patients were male and both groups had comparable body mass index and AB0 blood type distribution. Octagam-treated patients were younger (mean 65 +/- 15 versus 71 +/- 15 years, p = 0.066) and had slightly lower baseline disease scores (APACHE II: 20.6 versus 22.4, p = 0.281; SOFA: 5.0 versus 7.0, p = 0.006). Overall survival was 61% in the SIC + Octagam and 38% in the SIC only group (odds ratio: 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.9-5.4, p = 0.091 after controlling for baseline imbalances). Octagam significantly prolonged median survival time (68 versus 18 days, p = 0.014) and significantly reduced plasma levels of C-reactive protein (median change from baseline -71.5 versus -0.3 mg/L, p = 0.049). Conclusion:  Clinically relevant benefits through adjunct Octagam treatment in COVID-19 need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled trial.	false
0	Regional and global contributions of air pollution to risk of death from COVID-19. AIMS: The risk of mortality from the coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) is increased by comorbidity from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Air pollution also causes excess mortality from these conditions. Analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outcomes in 2003, and preliminary investigations of those for SARS-CoV-2 since 2019, provide evidence that the incidence and severity are related to ambient air pollution. We estimated the fraction of COVID-19 mortality that is attributable to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution., METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized global exposure to fine particulates based on satellite data, and calculated the anthropogenic fraction with an atmospheric chemistry model. The degree to which air pollution influences COVID-19 mortality was derived from epidemiological data in the USA and China. We estimate that particulate air pollution contributed ~15% (95% confidence interval 7-33%) to COVID-19 mortality worldwide, 27% (13 - 46%) in East Asia, 19% (8-41%) in Europe, and 17% (6-39%) in North America. Globally, ~50-60% of the attributable, anthropogenic fraction is related to fossil fuel use, up to 70-80% in Europe, West Asia, and North America., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Quantifying the shift in social contact patterns in response to non-pharmaceutical interventions. Social contact mixing plays a critical role in influencing the transmission routes of infectious diseases. Moreover, quantifying social contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly evolving pandemic intervened by changing public health measures is key for retroactive evaluation and proactive assessment of the effectiveness of different age- and setting-specific interventions. Contact mixing patterns have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic public health decision-making; but a rigorously justified methodology to identify setting-specific contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly developing pandemic, which can be informed by readily available data, is in great demand and has not yet been established. Here we fill in this critical gap by developing and utilizing a novel methodology, integrating social contact patterns derived from empirical data with a disease transmission model, that enables the usage of age-stratified incidence data to infer age-specific susceptibility, daily contact mixing patterns in workplace, household, school and community settings; and transmission acquired in these settings under different physical distancing measures. We demonstrated the utility of this methodology by performing an analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We quantified the age- and setting (household, workplace, community, and school)-specific mixing patterns and their evolution during the escalation of public health interventions in Ontario, Canada. We estimated a reduction in the average individual contact rate from 12.27 to 6.58 contacts per day, with an increase in household contacts, following the implementation of control measures. We also estimated increasing trends by age in both the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of symptomatic individuals diagnosed. Inferring the age- and setting-specific social contact mixing and key age-stratified epidemiological parameters, in the presence of evolving control measures, is critical to inform decision- and policy-making for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Critica al modelo centinela de vigilancia epidemiologica en la COVID-19. Objective: To analyze the increase in sentinel cases of COVID-19 in Mexico calculated from the effective number of reproductions of the infection (Rt) and compare its evolution with that reported by Italy, Spain and the United States of America during the first twenty weeks of evolution of the epidemic., Method: In an analytical cross-sectional design, the total number of cases of COVID-19 in Mexico from February 29 to July 24, 2020 was studied, and compared with sentinel cases calculated from the Rt. A descriptive and comparative analysis of prevalence, cumulative incidence and case fatality was performed to summarize the epidemiological data for Mexico and in relation to information for Italy, Spain, and the United States of North America., Results: In Mexico, until July 24, 2020, there are a total of 390,516 cases of COVID-19 and 43,680 deaths from this disease; with the use of Rt to calculate the correction of cases and unidentified deaths, the figure increases to 3,780,195 cases (p = 0.0002) and 211,469 deaths (p = 0.001). This suggests underreporting in the identification of cases and deaths and is associated with one of the highest case fatality rates in the world for SARS-CoV-2 infection., Conclusions: In Mexico, the sentinel model presents a significant loss of unquantified information. It is necessary to reinforce epidemiological surveillance through a better case detection strategy in our country and continue to apply measures that allow the containment and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Test sensitivity is secondary to frequency and turnaround time for COVID-19 screening. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.

0	Immunity and coagulation and fibrinolytic processes may reduce the risk of severe illness in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. Background: There are specific physiological features regarding the immunity and coagulation among pregnant women, which may play important roles in the development of coronavirus disease 2019. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the key factors associated with the deterioration of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and the differentiating clinical characteristics of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 to interfere with the progression of coronavirus disease 2019. Study Design: A retrospective study of 539 Chinese Han adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was conducted, of which 36 cases were pregnant women. In addition, 36 pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019 were recruited as the control. The characteristics of severe and critical illnesses, which were differentiated from mild and moderate illnesses in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. In addition, major differences between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and age-matched nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, paired with pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019, were explored to identify specific physiological features of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. Result(s): For the total patient population, the lymphocyte, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts were significantly lower, and white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were higher in those with severe or critical illness than those with mild or moderate illness (P<.001). The plasma levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio were significantly increased in patients with critical illness compared with patients with mild, moderate, and severe illnesses (P<.001). The above immunologic coclusters achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.801 (95% confidence interval, 0.764-0.838), and its combined model with the coagulation and fibrinolysis indices (prothrombin time, D-dimer) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.815 (95% confidence interval, 0.779-0.851) using the random forest regression model to predict severe or critical illness. For pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, none had preexisting diseases. Compared with nonpregnant women with mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 displayed increased white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, along with decreased lymphocyte and interleukin-4 levels (P<.05). Although they presented similar changes of immunologic markers of lymphocyte; white blood cell count; neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts; and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio, compared with nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, none of the pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 deteriorated into severe or critical illness. There was no significant difference in white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, immunologic markers, or coagulation and fibrinolysis markers between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019. As for the discrepancy of pathophysiological features between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the immunologic markers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.977), and its combined model with coagulation and fibrinolysis indices achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.931 (95% confidence interval, 0.850-1.000). Conclusion(s): Immune dysregulation was identified as a crucial feature of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, which developed severe or critical illness, and pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 presented with similar immune responses but rarer incidences of severe or critical illness. Immune dysregulation is related to the risks of deterioration into severe or critical illness. The specific coagulation and fibrinolysis systems of pregnancy may reduce the risk of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 without preexisting disease from developing severe illness.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Mathematical modelling and optimal cost-effective control of COVID-19 transmission dynamics. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains the current global health challenge. In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The most cost-effective control measure is determined through cost-effectiveness analysis. Numerical simulations of the overall system are implemented in MatLab R for demonstration of the theoretical results.

0	"Crowding effects on the dynamics of COVID-19 mathematical model. A disastrous coronavirus, which infects a normal person through droplets of infected person, has a route that is usually by mouth, eyes, nose or hands. These contact routes make it very dangerous as no one can get rid of it. The significant factor of increasing trend in COVID19 cases is the crowding factor, which we named ""crowding effects"". Modeling of this effect is highly necessary as it will help to predict the possible impact on the overall population. The nonlinear incidence rate is the best approach to modeling this effect. At the first step, the model is formulated by using a nonlinear incidence rate with inclusion of the crowding effect, then its positivity and proposed boundedness will be addressed leading to model dynamics using the reproductive number. Then to get the graphical results a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme and fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method are applied. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020."	false
0	Prevalence of COVID-19 Diagnostic Output with Chest Computed Tomography: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: The pooled prevalence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities and other detailed analysis related to patients' biodata like gender and different age groups have not been previously described for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thus necessitating this study. Objectives : To perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT, common CT morphological abnormalities, disease prevalence, biodata information, and gender prevalence of patients., METHODS: Studies were identified by searching PubMed and Science Direct libraries from 1 January 2020 to 30 April 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and RT-PCR, CT-imaging features, history of exposure, and biodata information were estimated using the quality effect (QE) model., RESULTS: Out of 36 studies included, the sensitivity was 89% (95% CI: 80-96%) and 98% (95% CI: 90-100%) for chest CT and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The pooled prevalence across lesion distribution were 72% (95% CI: 62-80%), 92% (95% CI: 84-97%) for lung lobe, 88% (95% CI: 81-93%) for patients with history of exposure, and 91% (95% CI: 85-96%) for patients with all categories of symptoms. Seventy-six percent (95% CI: 67-83%) had age distribution across four age groups, while the pooled prevalence was higher in the male with 54% (95% CI: 50-57%) and 46% (95% CI: 43-50%) in the female., CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of RT-PCR was higher than chest CT, and disease prevalence appears relatively higher in the elderly and males than children and females, respectively.	false

0	Assessing the age specificity of infection fatality rates for COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and public policy implications. Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.	false
0	COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature. Severe acute respiratory virus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a worldwide pandemic. Early studies in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients suggested a wide variety of presentations, however, there remains a paucity of robust data in this population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of SOT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1st t October 9th, 2020. Pooled incidence of symptoms, treatments and outcomes were assessed. Two hundred and fifteen studies were included for systematic review and 60 for meta-analysis. We identified 2,772 unique SOT recipients including 1,500 kidney, 505 liver, 141 heart and 97 lung. Most common presenting symptoms were fever and cough in 70.2% and 63.8% respectively. Majority (81%) required hospital admission. Immunosuppressive medications, especially antimetabolites, were decreased in 76.2%. Hydroxychloroquine and interleukin six antagonists were administered in59.5% and 14.9% respectively, while only few patients received remdesivir and convalescent plasma. Intensive care unit admission was 29% from amongst hospitalized patients. Only few studies reported secondary infections. Overall mortality was 18.6%. Our analysis shows a high incidence of hospital admission in SOT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As management of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, long-term outcomes among SOT recipients should be assessed in future studies. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Testing in Patients with Multiple Myeloma and Other Hematologic Malignancies on Monoclonal Antibody Therapies. BACKGROUND: Patients with hematological malignancies (HM), including multiple myeloma (MM), frequently suffer from immune deficiency-associated infectious complications because of both the disease and the treatment. Alarming results from China and the UK confirm the vulnerability of HM patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-driven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that the immunoassay interference from the endogenous monoclonal immunoglobulin (M paraprotein) and treatment antibodies continually challenges the MM management, it is critical to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 serology tests for suspected interference/cross-reactivity., METHODS: We compared the degree of interference in three SARS-CoV-2 serology assay platforms in HM patients with and without COVID-19 and on various therapeutic monoclonal antibody (t-mAb) treatments. Further, we confirmed the cross-reactivity in pooled samples from normal and COVID-19 + samples spiked with respective antibodies in vitro., RESULTS: None of the 93 HM patient samples with or without t-MAbs showed cross-reactivity on any of the three serology platforms tested., CONCLUSIONS: The tested three serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 are specific and do not have cross-reactivity with M-components or t-MAbs indicating that they can be used safely in oncology practice and in research exploring the immunologic response to COVID-19 in patients with HM.	false
0	Resilience Contributes to Low Emotional Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak Among the General Population in Italy. Background: The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting the overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, scant evidence is available to date. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress. This study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterized by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor., Methods: A total sample of 6,314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 29 and May 04 2020 through an online survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Resilience Scale (RS) were administered. Demographic data and lockdown related information were also collected. A correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between psychopathological domains and resilience. Three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables and the resilience as independent variable controlling for age, gender, and education. COVID-19 specific variables were also included in the three regression analyses. A further exploratory analysis was carried out to examine which aspects of resilience predict depression, anxiety, and stress., Results: The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 32% for depression, 24.4% for anxiety, and 31.7% for stress. The sample mean scores on depression, anxiety, and stress were higher than the normal scores reported in the literature. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that resilience was statically significant in predicting depression, anxiety, and stress. Geographic area of residence and infected acquaintances were also significant predictors. Regarding the resilience factors, results revealed that meaningfulness, perseverance, and equanimity were statistically significant in predicting all the DASS-21 scales., Conclusion: About a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak.

0	Recognizing COVID-19-related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management. Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related myocarditis cases have been reported. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response. COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. The clinical findings include changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function. When cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not feasible, cardiac computed tomographic angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression. Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative. Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment. The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Early Warning Indicators of Severe COVID-19: A Single-Center Study of Cases From Shanghai, China. Background: Patients with severe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can likely develop comorbidities, which can lead to irreversible organ damage and, eventually, death. However, early indicators of disease progression remain unclear. This study aimed to identify early indicators of disease progression to provide a basis for improved prognostic prediction and disease management. Method(s): We examined 53 recovered adult COVID-19 patients who were treated at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center between January 20, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The patients were categorized into the following four groups according to their condition at admission: mild condition (n = 3), moderate (n = 41), severe (n = 7), and critical (n = 2). They were also categorized according to disease progression as mild or moderate conditions that remained stable (n = 26), moderate disease that progressed to severe condition (n = 18), and continuously severe or critical (n = 9). We then focused on investigating the differences in the epidemiological and laboratory indicators between remained stable cases and progressed to severe condition cases. Result(s): Mild or moderate patients were younger than severe or critical patients. The number of patients with shortness of breath and underlying diabetes and heart disease at admission was higher in the severe or critical group. This group also showed considerably lower or higher values in 28 laboratory indicators. In addition, mild and moderate patients who remained stable were younger than moderate patients progressing to severe disease. Men had a higher risk of disease progression. Patients who progressed had either higher or lower values in 11 laboratory indicators. Survival curve analysis showed that age, procalcitonin, D-dimer, serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CD4%, and CD4/CD8 ratio were significant predictors of progression to severe disease. Conclusion(s): Lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, etc. are early warning indicators of severe COVID-19. Age (>64 years), shortness of breath, past histories of diabetes and heart disease, and abnormality in 28 other indicators at admission are indicative of severe or progression toward severe COVID-19. Meanwhile, abnormalities in 11 indicators and an abnormal coagulation function index at admission are risk factors for progression to severe disease.© Copyright © 2020 Lu, Sun, Guo, Wang, Li, Rong, Wang, Shang, Chang and Wang.	false
0	"The role and importance of chronic diseases in COVID-19 and related recommendations. In December 2019, a new coronavirus identified, named SARS-CoV-2, as a factor in the investigations conducted on the reporting of viral pneumonia cases in the Wuhan city of China, and the disease called ""Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"". Chronic diseases take the first line among the risk factors that increase the case fatality rates in COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. Chronic diseases that progress slowly, last for three months or more, caused by over one risk factor, usually show a complicated course and affect the quality of life of the person. In fact, chronic diseases caused a silent global epidemic, and together with the COVID-19 pandemic, they prepared a ground that increased the effects of the pandemic. The first data of COVID-19 increased our knowledge about the clinical characteristics of the disease and pointed out that the disease is more frequent and more severe in individuals with chronic disease. In this article, the literature information on the most common chronic diseases, with important role in COVID-19 course and mortality, is given.Copyright © 2020 Bilimsel Tip Yayinevi.

0	Critically ILL patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in a designated ICU: Clinical features and predictors for mortality. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic outbreak with a high mortality. Prognostic factors of critically ill patients with COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated yet. Method(s): In the present study, 59 patients with COVID-19 from the intensive care unit of the Caidian Branch of Tongji Hospital were enrolled. Epidemiological, demographic, clin-ical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data, and clinical outcomes were collected. Prognostic factors were statistically defined. Result(s): Of the 59 patients studied (67.4+/-11.3 years), 38 patients were male, 51 had underlying diseases, and 41 patients died during admission. Compared with the survivors, the deceased patients were of older age, had more smoking history, severer fatigue, and diarrhea, a higher incidence of multiple organ injuries, more deteriorative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, remarkably impaired cellular immune response, and strengthened cyto-kine release. Age higher than 70 (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.45-5.23), arrhythmia (OR=4.76, 95% CI=1.59-14.25), and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score above 4 (OR=5.16, 95% CI=1.29-20.55) were identified as risk factors for mortality of patients. Conclusion(s): Critically ill COVID-19 patients aged higher than 70, arrhythmia, or a SOFA score above 4 have a high risk of mortality, and need prior medical intervention.Copyright © 2020 Wang et al.	false

0	Evaluation of transport media and specimen transport conditions for the detection of sars-cov-2 by use of real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The global coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a worldwide shortage of viral transport media and raised questions about specimen stability. The objective of this study was to determine the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in specimen transport media under various storage conditions. Transport media tested included UTM, UTM-RT, ESwab, M4, and saline (0.9% NaCl). Specimen types tested included nasopharyngeal/ oropharyngeal swabs in the above-named transport media, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and sputum. A high-titer SARS-CoV-2 remnant patient specimen was spiked into pooled SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative specimen remnants for the various medium types. Aliquots of samples were stored at 18degreeC to 26degreeC, 2degreeC to 8degreeC, and 10degreeC to 30degreeC and then tested at time points up to 14 days. Specimens consistently yielded amplifiable RNA with mean cycle threshold differences of 3 over the various conditions assayed, thus supporting the use and transport of alternative collection media and specimen types under a variety of temperature storage conditions.Copyright © 2020 Rogers et al.

0	Sudden onset, acute loss of taste and smell in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Early detection, isolation and management of COVID-19 are crucial to contain the current pandemic. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. RESULT(S): Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine.	false

0	Laboratory findings in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Background: Since its first description, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV, has attracted tremendous attention in a short period of time as the death toll and number of confirmed cases grows unceasingly. Method(s): To provide a better understanding of the importance of abnormal laboratory findings in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis, we searched the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science medical databases and selected 19 articles (totaling 2988 patients, 484 of whom [16.1%] had severe disease) that reported panels of laboratory examinations in patients with COVID-19. Result(s): Although in vitro diagnostics, primarily using PCR- and ELISA-based methods, efficiently contribute to the etiological identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we suggest that laboratory medicine may also be of significant assistance when differentiating between severe and non-severe COVID-19. Conclusion(s): When we wrote this article, our ability to provide a definitive conclusion may have been adversely affected by some limitations, such as the low sample size, differently applied methods, dissimilar reference ranges, non-synchronized representations of results, and variety of the patients' panels. Despite the limitations, the analysis of the current scientific literature demonstrates the value of laboratory parameters as simple, rapid, and cost-effective biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

We evaluated the performance of the Abbott BinaxNOW TM Covid-19 rapid antigen test to detect virus among persons, regardless of symptoms, at a public plaza site of ongoing community transmission. Titration with cultured clinical SARS-CoV-2 yielded a human observable threshold between 1.6x10 4 -4.3x10 4 viral RNA copies (cycle threshold (Ct) of 30.3-28.8 in this assay). Among 878 subjects tested, 3% (26/878) were positive by RT-PCR, of which 15/26 had a Ct<30, indicating high viral load. 40% (6/15) of Ct<30 were asymptomatic. Using this Ct<30 threshold for Binax-CoV2 evaluation, the sensitivity of the Binax-CoV2 was 93.3% (14/15), 95% CI: 68.1-99.8%, and the specificity was 99.9% (862/863), 95% CI: 99.4-99.9%.	false
0	Rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based evaluation of COVID-19: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test accuracy study & its implications for COVID-19 management in India. Background & objectives: : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far affected over 41 million people globally. The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). Method(s): : A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. Result(s): : Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness <=5 days. Interpretation & conclusions: : With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness <=5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.	false
0	No evidence of increasing COVID-19 in health care workers after implementation of high flow nasal cannula: A safety evaluation. Background: Initial recommendations discouraged high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19 patients, driven by concern for healthcare worker (HCW) exposure. Noting high morbidity and mortality from early invasive mechanical ventilation, we implemented a COVID-19 respiratory protocol employing HFNC in severe COVID-19 and HCW exposed to COVID-19 patients on HFNC wore N95/KN95 masks. Utilization of HFNC increased significantly but questions remained regarding HCW infection rate. Method(s): We performed a retrospective evaluation of employee infections in our healthcare system using the Employee Health Services database and unit records of employees tested between March 15, 2020 and May 23, 2020. We assessed the incidence of infections before and after the implementation of the protocol, stratifying by clinical or non-clinical role as well as inpatient COVID-19 unit. Result(s): During the study period, 13.9% (228/1635) of employees tested for COVID-19 were positive. Forty-six percent of infections were in non-clinical staff. After implementation of the respiratory protocol, the proportion of positive tests in clinical staff (41.5%) was not higher than that in non-clinical staff (43.8%). Of the clinicians working in the high-risk COVID-19 unit, there was no increase in infections after protocol implementation compared with clinicians working in COVID-19 units that did not use HFNC. Conclusion(s): We found no evidence of increased COVID-19 infections in HCW after the implementation of a respiratory protocol that increased use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19; however, these results are hypothesis generating.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	Vitamin D 25OH deficiency in COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Great interest has been raised by the possible protective role of vitamin D in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but objective data on 25(OH)vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are not conclusive. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of 25(OH)vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian referral hospital and explore its association with clinical outcomes and the markers of disease severity., METHODS: In this single-center cohort study, 129 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an Italian referral center were enrolled from March to April 2020. 25(OH)Vitamin D serum levels were assessed 48 h since hospital admission and categorized into: normal (>=30 ng/mL), insufficient (<30 - >=20 ng/mL), moderately deficient (<20 - >=10 ng/mL), severely deficient (<10 ng/mL)., RESULTS: The prevalence of 25(OH)vitamin D insufficiency, moderate deficiency and severe deficiency was 13.2%, 22.5% and 54.3%, respectively. 25(OH)Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was not associated with COVID-19 clinical features and outcomes. Unexpectedly, after adjusting for major confounders, a significant positive association between increasing 25(OH)vitamin D levels and in-hospital mortality (on a continuous logarithmic scale, odds ratio = 1.73 [95% CI, 1.11 to 2.69]; P = .016) was observed., CONCLUSIONS: Very low 25(OH)vitamin D levels were highly prevalent and suggestive of deficiency among our hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients, but low 25(OH)vitamin D levels were not associated with outcome variables. Whether 25(OH)vitamin D adequacy may influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 and the unexpected correlation between higher 25(OH)vitamin D levels and mortality require further investigations by large intervention trials.

0	Investigation of protective exposure risk events in nurses against corona virus disease 2019 in Wuhan. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current situation of virus exposure risk incidents of nurses against corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, and to provide reference evidence for nursing managers to protect nursing staff who were working in the isolation ward. METHOD(S): In the study, 308 nursing staff against COVID-19 working in the isolation ward in Wuhan were conveniently selected to participate in the investigation. The designed questionnaires including 7 kinds of protective exposure risk events were made by the team of researchers on the basis of literature review and interview with the nurses in Wuhan. All the participants recalled their working experience in the status of dressing in personal protective equipment and filled in the questionnaires online by WeChat according to the same instruction. RESULT(S): The questionnaires were filled in validly by a total of 304 nursing staff, of whom 88.8% received emergency training on the prevention and dealing measurement of exposure risk events. The incidence of shoe cover contamination, falling off or torn was relatively high, about 53.6%. Due to the protection of gloves, the incidence of hand or skin contamination was relatively low, about 14.1%. The most nervousness of protective exposure risk event for nurses was N95 mask contamination, falling off or shifting, with a score of 8.2+/-2.3, showing a higher psychiatric burden. Single factor analysis found that the number of days in Wuhan was different, the number of the types of protective risk events occurred was different (chi2=14.562, P=0.024), orderly multivariate Logistic regression found that men were the independent protective factor for the number of the types of protective exposure risk events that occurred (P=0.019). CONCLUSION(S): Protective exposure risk events may occur in the work of nursing staff working in the isolation ward in Wuhan. It is necessary to guide nurses to prevent the occurrence of protective exposure risk events and effectively deal with them, so as to prevent virus exposure and reduce psycholo-gical burden.	false
0	Increased occurrence of hand eczema in young children following the Danish hand hygiene recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic of Spring 2020, Denmark was one of the first countries to introduce lockdown measures, including closing of all daycare centers. Following the reopening of daycare centers, Danish Health Authorities implemented a mandatory intensive hand hygiene regimen. OBJECTIVE(S): To examine the occurrence and point prevalence of hand eczema as a consequence of more intensive hand hygiene among Danish children attending daycare. METHOD(S): The heads of 1,667 daycare centers in Denmark were contacted and asked to forward a link to a questionnaire to parents of the children attending the daycare center. RESULT(S): Among 6858 children, 12.1% suffered from hand eczema before reopening of daycare centers, whereas 38.3% reported hand eczema after the children returned to daycare. Of the children who never suffered from hand eczema, 28.6% developed hand eczema after returning to daycare. The risk of hand eczema was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis, female gender, higher age, and frequency of handwashing. CONCLUSION(S): Following the implemented hygiene regimen, a high proportion of young children rapidly developed hand eczema. Well-established prophylactic skin care might have spared a proportion of the children from developing hand eczema. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

0	Incidental findings of COVID-19 in F18-FDG PET/CT from asymptomatic patients with cancer in two healthcare institutions in Bogota, Colombia. COVID-19 is the viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. Patients with cancer have a higher risk to acquire the infection and worse prognosis as they have to attend more medical visits in healthcare institutions, receive medical and surgical treatments, and be subjected to diagnostic studies such as PET/CT in nuclear medicine services where the infection may be an incidental finding. We present here F18-FDG PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose), images with findings of COVID-19 from patients with different oncological conditions but no respiratory symptoms.	false
0	New Insights in Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 Patients: Looking for the Role and Predictive Value of Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) and the Innate Immunity of the Oral Cavity and Respiratory Tract. COVID-19 is a viral pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus. The mechanisms of innate immunity, considered as the first line of antiviral defense, is essential towards viruses. A significant role in host defense of the lung, nasal and oral cavities is played by Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) HE4 has been demonstrated to be serum inflammatory biomarker and to show a role in natural immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract with both antimicrobial/antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Several biomarkers like IL-6, presepsin (PSP), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, D-Dimer have showed a good function as predictor factors for the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients (mild, severe and critical). The aim of this study was to correlate the blood levels of CRP, IL-6, PSP, PCT, D-Dimer with He4, to identify the predictive values of these biomarkers for the evolution of the disease and to evaluate the possible role of HE4 in the defense mechanisms of innate immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of Policlinico-University of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6 +/- 12.4 and 28 women age 65.7 +/- 15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4 +/- 7.7 and 6 women age 74.8 +/- 6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (r = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (r = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (r = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (r = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (r = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.	false
0	Mental Health Status of Paediatric Medical Workers in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak. Background: A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has occurred in China, and national medical workers have been thrown into this silent battle. Paediatric medical workers have been an important part of this battle and under enormous pressure. This paper evaluates the depression, anxiety, and stress of paediatric medical staff during the epidemic and examines related impact factors. Method(s): We conducted this study using online questionnaires via social networking software during the week of Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, 2020. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), which is a revised, simplified version of the original DASS developed by Lovibond et al., was used in this study. Result(s): Among all 2,031 respondents, 14.81%, 18.3%, and 9.98% had depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, respectively. Males, doctors, individuals aged between 31-60 years, those with senior job titles, those who had contact with patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, those who worked on the clinical frontlines fighting the epidemic and those who had experience combating similar outbreaks were more likely to have depression, anxiety or stress symptoms. Respondents in Beijing and Chongqing had lower negative psychological symptom scores than the national average. Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression, anxiety and stress are present to varying degrees among paediatric medical workers across the country. Psychological crisis interventions should be implemented to protect the mental health of paediatric medical workers during and after the epidemic.© Copyright © 2020 Liu, Wang, Chen, Zhang, Bao and Shi.	false

0	Health care seeking due to COVID-19 related symptoms and health care cancellations among older Brazilian adults: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The continent of the Americas has the greatest number of people infected and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the world. Brazil occupies the 2nd position in numbers of infected cases and deaths, preceded only by the United States. Older adults and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has serious consequences for health services. Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on health care use in Brazil among older adults. Results highlight the need to adapt health care delivery (such as through telemedicine) to ensure the continuity of care as well as the urgent need for wide dissemination of information to guide the population on disease prevention measures and how to obtain healthcare when needed.	false
0	COVID-19 Vaccines Currently under Preclinical and Clinical Studies, and Associated Antiviral Immune Response. With a death toll of over one million worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become the most devastating humanitarian catastrophe in recent decades. The fear of acquiring infection and spreading to vulnerable people has severely impacted society's socio-economic status. To put an end to this growing number of infections and deaths as well as to switch from restricted to everyday living, an effective vaccine is desperately needed. As a result, enormous efforts have been made globally to develop numerous vaccine candidates in a matter of months. Currently, over 30 vaccine candidates are under assessment in clinical trials, with several undergoing preclinical studies. Here, we reviewed the major vaccine candidates based on the specific vaccine platform utilized to develop them. We also discussed the immune responses generated by these candidates in humans and preclinical models to determine vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Finally, immune responses induced in recovered COVID-19 patients and their possible vaccine development implications were also briefly reviewed.	false
0	Saliva is a promising alternative specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults. Testing efforts for SARS-CoV-2 have been burdened by the scarcity of testing materials and personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 32.2% (97/300) of the individuals using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher). Performance of saliva and NPS were compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. The overall concordance for saliva and NPS was 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. The positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS was 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. Saliva detected 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. In symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA: 82.4% vs 85.3%). The overall PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva detecting 4 cases less than NPS. However, saliva performance in symptomatic adults was identical to NPS (PPA of 93.8%). With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate alternative sample choice to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults., Summary: Saliva is an acceptable alternative specimen compared to nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, saliva demonstrated comparable performance to nasopharyngeal swabs in symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients and in symptomatic adults.	false

0	Case Report: Viral shedding for 60 days in a woman with COVID-19. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern. This was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and since then has become widespread globally. We report a 71-year-old woman with documented viral shedding (based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing) of SARS-CoV-2 for 60 days from the onset of symptoms (55 days from her first positive test and 36 days after complete resolution of symptoms). This is to our knowledge the longest duration of viral shedding reported to date. This case demonstrates that viral shedding after COVID-19 diagnosis can be prolonged.Copyright © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	false
0	COVID-19 effective reproduction number dropped during Spain's nationwide dropdown, then spiked at lower-incidence regions. COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide. Spain has suffered one of the largest nationwide bursts, particularly in the highly populated areas of Madrid and Barcelona (two of the five largest conurbations in Europe). We used segmented regression analyses to identify shifts in the evolution of the effective reproduction number (Rt) reported for 16 Spanish administrative regions. We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions, and even increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread, and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities). Most importantly, they highlight the importance of maintaining strong social distancing measures and strengthening public health control during lockdown de-escalation. Copyright © 2020.

0	Clinical manifestations and pathogen characteristics in children admitted for suspected COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread around the world. However, approaches to distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have not yet been reported. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 97 children with probable COVID-19. A total of 13 (13.4%) patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nucleic acid RT-PCR testing, and 41 (42.3%) patients were found to be infected with other pathogens. Notably, no pathogen was detected in 43 (44.3%) patients. Among all patients, 25 (25.8%) had familial cluster exposure history, and 52 (53.6%) had one or more coexisting conditions. Fifteen (15.5%) patients were admitted or transferred to the PICU. In the 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 5 (45.5%) and 7 (63.6%) were positive for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In 22 patients with suspected COVID-19, 1 (4.5%) was positive for IgG but negative for IgM. The most frequently detected pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumonia (29, 29.9%). One patient with confirmed COVID-19 died. Our results strongly indicated that the detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 or coexisting conditions must be strengthened in pediatric patients. These cases may be difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 unless etiologic analysis is conducted. A serologic test can be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in cases where SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly suspected but the nucleic acid test is negative.	false
0	Clinical features and laboratory diagnosis tool for emerging corona virus (COVID-19): A review. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pneumonia disease with a severe outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which is caused by coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) with severe acute respiratory syndrome. There have been tremendous advances in in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial diagnostic of COVID-19 is based on the test of Sputum, Blood and SWAB of throat and nose. The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours but shortened to minimum of 45 hr. Another method of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min and has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA). A range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulin produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection i.e, immunoglobulin (IgM) and immunoglobulin (IgG). In this review, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss various diagnostic method of COVID-19, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for eradiating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © Journal of Global Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences	false
0	Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Heart Failure Admitted with Covid-19 in a Cohort Study from Southeast Michigan. Introduction: Cardiovascular comorbidities confer worse outcomes for patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the impact of heart failure (HF) with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced (HFrEF) ejection fraction has not been well characterized. The aim herein is to examine outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without HF. Method(s): Patients (n = 437) consecutively admitted with COVID-19 were categorized according to the presence vs. absence of HF and subcategorized according to HFpEF and HFrEF (EF <50%). The primary outcome was inpatient mortality with independent correlates were identified with logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and need for mechanical ventilation. Result(s): The median cohort patient age was 68 (56-76) years, 43% (n = 189) were female, and 41% (n = 179) were Caucasian. HF was present in 29.7% (n = 130) of patients of which 43.8% (n = 57) had HFrEF and 56.2% (N = 73) had HFpEF. Patients with HF were more likely to be of older age and have more comorbidities. Overall inpatient mortality in the cohort was 12.3%. Compared to patients without HF (7.6%), patients with HFpEF (39.1%) and HFrEF (23.5%) had higher inpatient mortality (p<0.05) and were more likely to develop AKI, require mechanical ventilation, and have worse ARDS (figure 1). ACE/ARB and/or hydroxychloroquine were not associated with mortality (p >0.05) and there were no differences in inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH). Independent predictors of inpatient mortality included: HFpEF (adjOR 2.55 (1.37-4.76)), age > 65 years (adjOR 3.00 (1.66-5.43), African American race (adjOR 1.82 (1.00-3.30)), Other race (adjOR 2.34 (1.02-5.37), p = 0.043), cerebrovascular disease (adjOR 3.07 (1.54-6.10), p = 0.001), and chronic hypoxic respiratory failure [adjOR 3.02 (1.19-7.62], p = 0.019)], whereas HFrEF was not (adjOR 1.58 (0.77-3.23). Discussion(s): HF is prevalent in patients admitted with COVID-19. Patients with HFpEF had 2.6-fold higher mortality than those without HF and greater burdens of inpatient complications. Patients with HFpEF with COVID19 may warrant closer outpatient monitoring and a lower threshold for admission.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Autopsy Findings and Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 210 000 deaths worldwide. However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features. OBJECTIVE(S): To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS: The first 12 consecutive COVID-19-positive deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. RESULT(S): Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (n = 10) or outpatient sector (n = 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart. LIMITATION: Limited sample size. CONCLUSION(S): The high incidence of thromboembolic events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism and overall clinical incidence of COVID-19-related death, as well as possible therapeutic interventions to reduce it.

0	Association Between Social Vulnerability and a County's Risk for Becoming a COVID-19 Hotspot - United States, June 1-July 25, 2020. Poverty, crowded housing, and other community attributes associated with social vulnerability increase a community's risk for adverse health outcomes during and following a public health event (1). CDC uses standard criteria to identify U.S. counties with rapidly increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspot counties) to support health departments in coordinating public health responses (2). County-level data on COVID-19 cases during June 1-July 25, 2020 and from the 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) were analyzed to examine associations between social vulnerability and hotspot detection and to describe incidence after hotspot detection. Areas with greater social vulnerabilities, particularly those related to higher representation of racial and ethnic minority residents (risk ratio [RR] = 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4-6.4), density of housing units per structure (RR = 3.1; 95% CI = 2.7-3.6), and crowded housing units (i.e., more persons than rooms) (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.8-2.3), were more likely to become hotspots, especially in less urban areas. Among hotspot counties, those with greater social vulnerability had higher COVID-19 incidence during the 14 days after detection (212-234 cases per 100,000 persons for highest SVI quartile versus 35-131 cases per 100,000 persons for other quartiles). Focused public health action at the federal, state, and local levels is needed not only to prevent communities with greater social vulnerability from becoming hotspots but also to decrease persistently high incidence among hotspot counties that are socially vulnerable.	false
0	Are night shift workers at an increased risk for COVID-19?. Recent data has revealed an association between coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) incidence and seasonally regulated androgen sensitivity. This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health, leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Shift work, especially night shift work, has long been associated with several chronic health conditions. The mechanisms that drive these associations are not well understood; however, current literature suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms may cause downstream hormonal and immune effects that render night shift workers more susceptible to disease. First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit the production of melatonin, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work. These data suggest that further research is warranted and that high-risk occupations should be taken into consideration as public health policies are introduced and evolve.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Air Leak Syndrome in Two Very Preterm Infants Born to Mothers with Coronavirus Disease 2019: An Association or a Coincidence?. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mostly affects adults with limited information on possible vertical transmission from pregnant mothers. We present here two very preterm infants born to mothers with COVID-19, whose respiratory course was significant for initial mild respiratory distress syndrome who developed acute onset severe air leak syndrome at approximately 24 to 36 hours of age requiring thoracentesis. Their respiratory status improved gradually with resolution of air leak and respiratory failure by 2 weeks of age. Both infants tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of multiple respiratory specimens collected beyond 24 hours after birth. As the incidence of severe air leak syndrome is relatively low in preterm infants without risk factors, this presentation in two very preterm infants born to mothers with COVID-19 is intriguing and needs to be further evaluated in larger cohorts. If confirmed, this data could potentially be the first step toward generating hypotheses for mechanisms of lung injury, intrauterine transmission, or how to detect COVID-19 in preterm infants. In addition, these data will be critical for developing evidence-based guidelines for perinatal management of these infants as we continue to battle against the COVID-19 pandemic for the foreseeable future.

0	TCT CONNECT-215 Demographics and In-Hospital Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients Undergoing an Invasive Strategy for Acute Coronary Syndrome: The Global Multi-Centre Prospective COVID-ACS Registry. Background: The demographics, angiographic findings, and in-hospital outcomes of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) - positive patients undergoing an invasive strategy for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are not well defined. COVID-19-positive ACS patients may have different etiology and outcomes. Patient presentation times from small sample published data appear longer. Method(s): Anonymized data on 234 patients in 81 global centers are presented from this prospective registry for the period March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. As of submission date, a further 84 patients have been submitted. All were required to be COVID-19-positive (or have a high index of clinical suspicion, i.e., clinical status plus chest x ray/computed tomography scan findings) and to undergo coronary angiography for suspected ACS. Result(s): Results are shown in Tables 1-3 and compared with National United Kingdom British Cardiovascular Intervention Society/Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project databases of non-COVID-19 ACS patients where available and appropriate. Major findings were: significantly higher proportion of COVID-19-positive patients had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal dysfunction. In the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) subgroup, symptom-to-door time was >double and door-to-balloon increased by median 20 minutes. Mortality was quadruple and in-patient stay double in this group. Similarly, mortality was significantly higher in non-STEMI COVID-19-positive cohort and in-patient stay also double. The high mortality may be due to the high incidence of cardiogenic shock (13.4% vs. 5%), with its 67% mortality. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): These novel data indicate that COVID-19-positive ACS patients present later, have higher incidence of cardiogenic shock, and much higher mortality, which are likely to be inter-related. In-patient stay is prolonged compared to non-COVID-19 ACS. Categories: CORONARY: Acute Coronary SyndromesCopyright © 2020	false
0	Bi-paratopic and multivalent VH domains block ACE2 binding and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domains toward neutralizing epitopes. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes and further assembled these into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These VH constructs showed increased affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1,400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0nM (180ngml-1). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain engaging an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, confirming our original design strategy.	false

On one hand, diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. On the other hand, new onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In this report, we describe two patient with diabetes mellitus who presented to our hospital with DKA. We also reviewed almost all published cases of DKA that had been precipitated by COVID-19. Method(s): Two patients were admitted with DKA, who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 on the basis of real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and management outcomes were documented. Result(s): First patient (30-year-male) had undiagnosed diabetes and no other comorbidities, and COVID-19 precipitated DKA. He also had COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Second patient (60-year-male) had long duration hypertension with no prior history of diabetes and developed cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was also diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR assay) and DKA in the hospital. CVA and COVID-19 could have precipitated DKA. Both patients responded well to treatment and were discharged in a stable condition. Conclusion(s): These cases show that COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in a significant number of patients. DKA can occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes. As COVID-19 and diabetes are prevalent conditions, high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose DKA timely in order to improve the prognosis of COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis.Copyright © 2020	false

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of cancer inpatients with COVID-19 exploring clinical outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR., RESULTS: The mean age was 55.3 years (SD +/- 21.1). Comorbidities were present in 110 (60.8%) cases. The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. Metastatic disease accounted for 90 (49.7%) cases. In total, 63 (34.8%) had recently received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02). After multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (P = .027) and with two or more metastatic sites (P < .001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death., CONCLUSION: This is the first Brazilian cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high.	false
0	Precautions in dentistry against the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019. The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe global acute respiratory pandemic around the world in just a few months with an increasing number of infections and deaths. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and fatal disease. Almost everyone in the population is susceptible, and the incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. The clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 are fever, dry cough and fatigue. Some patients are accompanied by symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. Severe patients could even develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidosis and multifunctional organ failure, etc. Due to the relatively closed environment of dental clinics and the unique nature of dental procedures, both dental personnel and patients are easy to get infection through currently known respiratory droplet transmission, aerosol transmission, close contact transmission and other ways, inducing mutual cross-infection. Dental practitioners are facing unprecedented challenges due to the high risk of exposure to droplets and aerosols from saliva and other body fluids during dental procedures. Based on our experience and relevant research, this article introduces the basic knowledge about COVID-19 and the corresponding protective measures for dental practitioners, includes the risk of infection during dental procedures, the precautions related to the patients, infection control measures during dental treatment in clinics, protection measures at different levels for dental practitioners, and emergency dental treatment for confirmed COVID-19. It is the responsibility of every dental practitioner to fully understand the characteristics of the new coronavirus and strictly implement the most appropriate protective measures to reduce and control the risk of cross infection in dental procedures.Copyright © 2020	false

Many patients require mechanical ventilation. The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and identify factors associated with death. Method(s): Eighty-three consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective, single-center, observational study from January 31 to March 15, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and mechanical ventilation data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality after endotracheal intubation. The secondary outcomes included the incidences of SARS-CoV-2-related cardiac, liver, and kidney injury. Result(s): Seventy-four out of 83 (89.2%) patients achieved oxygen saturation above 93% after intubation. Forty-nine out of 83 (59%) patients died and 34 (41%) patients survived after 28 days of observation. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of death associated with cardiac injury (odds ratio 15.60, 95% CI 4.20-74.43), liver injury (5.40, 1.46-23.56), and kidney injury (8.39, 1.63-61.41), and decreasing odds of death associated with the higher PaO2/FiO2 ratio before intubation (0.97, 0.95-0.99). PaO2/FiO2 ratio before intubation demonstrated a positive linear correlation with platelet count (r = 0.424, P = 0.001), and negative linear correlation with troponin I (r = -0.395, P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): Cardiac, liver, and kidney injury may be associated with death for critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. The severity of pre-intubation hypoxia may be associated with a poorer outcome of patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Larger, multi-institutional, prospective studies should be conducted to confirm these preliminary results.© Copyright © 2020 Zhao, Lin, Zhou, Wang, Chen, Clifford, Akca, Huang and Chen.	false
0	Mitigating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on controlling vascular risk factors among participants in a carotid stenosis trial. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to managing vascular risk factors with in-person follow-up of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis enrolled in the CREST2 trial. CREST2 is comparing intensive medical management alone versus intensive medical management plus revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting. We performed a study to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based program for testing blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in CREST2. Method(s): This study involved 45 patients at 10 sites in the CREST2 trial. The initial patients were identified by the Medical Management Core (MMC) as high-risk patients defined by stage 2 hypertension, LDL > 90 mg/dl, or both. If a patient at the site declined participation, another was substituted. All patients who agreed to participate were sent a BP monitoring device and a commercially available at-home lipid test kit that uses a self-performed finger-stick blood sample that was resulted to the patient. Training on the use of the equipment and obtaining the risk factor results was done by the study coordinator by telephone. Result(s): Ten of the 130 currently active CREST2 sites participated, 8 in the LDL portion and 5 in the BP portion (3 sites did both). Twenty-six BP devices and 23 lipid tests were sent to patients. Of the 26 patients who obtained BP readings with the devices, 9 were out of the study target and adjustments in BP medications were made in 3. Of the 23 patients sent LDL tests, 13 were able to perform the test showing 7 were out of target, leading to adjustments in lipid medications in 4. Conclusion(s): This study established the feasibility of at-home monitoring of BP and LDL in a clinical trial and identified implementation challenges prior to widespread use in the trial.

0	The duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in patients recovering from COVID-19. The knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) shedding is highly relevant to the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Deep nasopharyngeal swabs repeatedly collected from a cohort of one hundred patients with COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). The median period of viral genome detectability was 15 days. Furthermore, the authors tested the hypothesis on the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the period in which the viral genome is detectable. They did not find any statistically significant difference in the duration of viral clearance between patients with asymptomatic to mild disease or severe disease.	false
0	COVID-19 susceptibility in pregnancy: Immune/inflammatory considerations, the role of placental ACE-2 and research considerations. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, to which herd immunity has not yet developed and both molecular and serological testing are not without flaws. The virus evokes a state of severe and widespread inflammation, and stimulates both innate and adaptive immune response. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is present in endothelial cells and has been noted within the human placenta. There are questions about whether pregnancy would increase the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19 and disease severity within this population. In this report, we highlight physiological and immune/inflammatory considerations that may explain the susceptibility and disease pathology in response to SARS CoV-2 during pregnancy, explore testing considerations in asymptomatic individuals, discuss the potential role and of placental ACE2 receptor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in pregnancy and in pregnancy outcomes, and finally share our perspective with respect to an urgently needed change concerning involvement of pregnant women in research addressing COVID-19.

0	Temporal Clinical and Laboratory Response to Interleukin-6 Receptor Blockade With Tocilizumab in 89 Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia. Background: Pandemic COVID-19 pneumonia due to SARS-2 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence links poor outcomes to an inflammatory cytokine storm., Methods: We treated 89 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and heightened systemic inflammation (elevated serum C reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels) with an infusion of tocilizumab (TCZ), a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the interleukin-6 receptor., Results: Clinical and laboratory evidence of improvement was evident when baseline and 1-2-day post-infusion indices were compared. Among the 72 patients receiving supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, severity of condition on the NEWS2 scale scores fell from 5 to 2 (P<0.001), C reactive protein levels fell from 95 to 14 mg/L (P<0.001), and lymphocyte counts rose from 900 to 1000/uL (P=0.036). Sixty-three of 72 patients were discharged from the hospital, one patient died, and eight patients remained in the hospital at the time of this writing. Among the 17 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, despite a rapid decrease in CRP levels from 89 to 35 mg/L (P=0.014) and early improvements in NEWS2 scores in 10 of 17 patients, 10 patients ultimately died and the other seven remain in the hospital at the time of this writing. Overall, mortality was only seen in patients who had markedly elevated CRP levels (>30 mg/L) and low lymphocyte counts (<1000/uL) before TCZ administration., Conclusions: Inflammation and lymphocytopenia are linked to mortality in COVID-19. Inhibition of IL-6 activity by administration of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, is associated with rapid improvement in both CRP and lymphocyte counts and in clinical indices. Controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the utility of IL-6 blockade in this setting. Additional interventions will be needed for patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

0	"Commonalities Between COVID-19 and Radiation Injury. As the multi-systemic components of COVID-19 emerge, parallel etiologies can be drawn between SARS-CoV-2 infection and radiation injuries. While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., ""COVID toes"", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries. Furthermore, this intersection between COVID-19 and ARS may point to approaches that could accelerate the discovery of treatments for both.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society."	false

0	CT screening for COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients before hospital admission. INTRODUCTION: In the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era, it is essential to rule out COVID-19 effectively to prevent transmission in both communities and medical facilities. According to previous reports in high prevalence areas, CT screening may be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the value of CT screening in low prevalence areas has scarcely been reported., METHODS: This report examines the diagnostic efficacy of CT screening before admission to a hospital in Tokyo. We conducted a retrospective analysis at Keio University Hospital from April 6, 2020, through May 29, 2020. We set up an outpatient screening clinic on April 6 for COVID-19, administering both PCR with nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT for all patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia., RESULTS: A total of 292 asymptomatic patients were included in this study. There were three PCR-positive patients, and they all had negative CT findings, which revealed that both the sensitivity and positive predictive value of CT (PPV) were 0%. There were nine CT-positive patients; the specificity and the negative predictive value (NPV) were 96.9% and 98.9%, respectively., CONCLUSION: CT screening was not useful in low prevalence areas at this time in Tokyo, even with the inclusion of the most prevalent phase. Given that the utility of CT screening depends on disease prevalence, the criteria for performing CT screening based on the prevalence of COVID-19 should be established.

0	A Case of Suspected Covid 19 Related Cardiomyopathy. Background: The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 has been associated with diverse cardiovascular pathology. We present a case of cardiomyopathy due to possible COVID-19 resulting in cardiogenic shock. Case: A 54 year-old male presented to the hospital with 4 weeks of progressive dyspnea, leg swelling, and weight gain. His symptoms began 4 weeks after experiencing influenza-like symptoms after a trip to China during the height of their COVID-19 outbreak. He was admitted to the COVID unit in cardiogenic shock and was later intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Laboratory data demonstrated acute kidney injury, elevated transaminases, lactic acidosis, elevated pro-BNP N-Terminal to 3932pg/mL, and high sensitivity troponin to 72ng/L. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe biventricular failure with a LVEF of 10% and a LVIDd 5.2cm. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative twice, but SARS-CoV-2 IgG AB and SARS-CoV-2 IgA AB were positive. Urgent right and left heart catheterization was performed demonstrating non-obstructive coronary artery disease and hemodynamics consistent with cardiogenic shock. While supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and norepinephrine, he had a fick cardiac output 3.1 L/min, fick cardiac index 1.6 L/min/m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 37mmHg, right atrial pressure 25mmHg, and pulmonary arterial pressures 65/40mmHg. Given persistent cardiogenic shock on IABP and inotropes, he was later transitioned to Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA ECMO) and an Impella CP for left ventricular unloading. He continued to have persistent INTERMACS I shock and underwent successful implantation of a HeartMate 3 LVAD with percutaneous temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Pathology of the left ventricular apical core demonstrates polyclonal endocardial infiltration of B-Cells, CD4 and CD8 positive T-Cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and plump reactive endothelial cells (Figure 1). He is currently recovering in the ICU off of vasoactive support with subsequent removal of percutaneous RVAD. Conclusion(s): This is a suspected case of COVID-19 associated cardiomyopathy presenting as new on-set heart failure with reduced ejection fraction complicated by cardiogenic shock. There is still much to learn about the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 and further studies are needed to determine appropriate diagnostics and management of such cases.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Factors associated with mental health results among workers with income losses exposed to COVID-19 in China. The outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a high prevalence of mental health problems in China and other countries. This was a cross-sectional study conducted using an online survey and face-to-face interviews to assess mental health problems and the associated factors among Chinese citizens with income losses exposed to COVID-19. The degrees of the depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress symptoms of our participants were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7), and the revised 7-item Impact of Event Scale (IES-7) scales, respectively, which found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress caused by COVID-19 were 45.5%, 49.5%, 30.9%, and 68.1%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among workers with income losses during COVID-19. Participants working in Hubei province with heavy income losses, especially pregnant women, were found to have a high risk of developing unfavorable mental health symptoms and may need psychological support or interventions.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Individuals with Down syndrome hospitalized with COVID-19 have more severe disease. Purpose: Rare genetic conditions like Down syndrome (DS) are historically understudied. Infection is a leading cause of mortality in DS, along with cardiac anomalies. Currently, it is unknown how the COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals with DS. Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, New York, USA. Method(s): In this retrospective, dual-center study of 7246 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we analyzed all patients with DS admitted in the Mount Sinai Health System and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We assessed hospitalization rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Result(s): We identified 12 patients with DS. Hospitalized individuals with DS are on average ten years younger than patients without DS. Patients with DS have more severe disease than controls, particularly an increased incidence of sepsis and mechanical ventilation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate that individuals with DS who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are younger than their non-DS counterparts, and that they have more severe disease than age-matched controls. We conclude that particular care should be considered for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.Copyright © 2020, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.	false
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Perspective Through the Lens of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to veterinary diagnostic laboratories. These challenges include partial or complete shutdowns, interrupted courier services, disruptions in workflow and diagnostic testing, new physical distancing practices, protocol development or enhancement for handling samples from high-risk or susceptible species, and fulfilling requirements for pre-test permission approval from state and federal veterinary agencies, all of which have been implemented to prevent or minimize exposure and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 locally or regionally. As in people, SARS-CoV-2 infects animals through direct animal-to-animal contact and aerosol transmission between animals. Humans can also infect pets or other animals in their care and, although human-to-human transmission is the main route of viral spread in people, infected animals and specimens of their bodily fluids or tissues are a potential source of infection for veterinarians and technical or laboratory personnel that are handling them. In this perspective, we discuss how SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated rapid changes in laboratory operation to minimize zoonotic risk to personnel and to implement tests for identifying the virus in animals. The pandemic has highlighted the adaptability and quick response of veterinary diagnosticians to an emerging infectious disease and their critical role in maintaining animal health, while synergizing with and protecting human public health.	false

0	Upsurge in COVID-19 testing versus latest trends of active patients in Indian scenario: Emerging trends and future predictions. World Health Organization (WHO) has already declared the COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the pandemic of the year 2020, after its first outbreak reported in Wuhan, China. There have been numerous efforts laid upon by respective Governments in order to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. One of the primary initiatives in this direction was to ascertain the number of cases through testing. Testing for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 is a crucial factor to know the prevalence, spread and transmissible nature of the disease. Moreover, how effective the testing strategy is prerequisite for knowing the exact number of infected cases by COVID-19. In India, 1,58,49,068 samples have been tested, out of which 13,36,861 samples have been found to be positive up to 24th July 2020. The testing strategy adopted by India has yielded fruitful and effective results so far when compared to nations like United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. Current article focuses upon the dire need to upsurge testing in accordance to daily cases identified testing based on the macro and micro analysis of Covid-19 data in Indian scenario including all the Indian States and Union Territories. This article might give some due insights into enhancing the testing capabilities as well as testing strategies so as to contain the spread of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Considering that India has started to unlock with Unlock 1.0 and Unlock 2.0, the Covid-19 pandemic has started to disseminate to rural population and smaller cities have shown significant rise in Covid-19 infections. Therefore, testing across the whole nation and especially testing of travellers from hotspot zones has become a necessity else, community transmission looks inevitable and India would be at the edge of a pandemic within a pandemic within a couple of months.Copyright © 2020, Connect Journal.	false

Rapid Decay of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Persons with Mild Covid-19 (N Engl J Med 2020;383:1085-1087). An error was made in the calculation of the half-life of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The estimated slope (-0.0083 log10 ng per milliliter per day) and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.0115 to -0.0050) are correct. However, the calculated half-life based on that slope is approximately 36 days (95% CI, 26 to 60), not 73 days (95% CI, 52 to 120).

0	Comparison of a rapid immunochromatographic test with a chemiluminescence immunoassay for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IGM and IGG. Introduction: The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been characterized as a pandemic, representing a serious global public health emer-gency. Serological tests have been proposed as reliable tools for detecting Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in infected patients, especially for surveillance or epidemiological purposes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the agreement between the IgM/IgG rapid assays, based on lateral flow immunochromatographic assay, and the fully automated 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, based on chemiluminescence immunoassay. Material(s) and Method(s): SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS IgM/IgG test (BIOSYNEX, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) and the MAGLUMI CLIA (IgM and IgG) (SNIBE - Shenzhen New Industries Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen, China) in 70 serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. The strength of the agreement of the two methods was calculated by using the Cohen Kappa index. Result(s): The results showed a good grade of concordance between the two immunoassays with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.54-0.87) for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 0.70 (95%CI: 0.53-0.87) for IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In addition, the rapid assays BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 10.63 (95%CI: 2.79-40.57) for IgG and a LR of 6.79 (95%CI: 2.93-15.69) for IgM. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that the immunochromatographic rapid IgM/IgG test and the chemiluminescence IgM and IgG immunoassay have a good degree of concordance, suggesting that both could be considered as useful tools for epidemiologic surveillance.Copyright © 2020, Biochemia Medica, Editorial Office.

0	Engineering human ACE2 to optimize binding to the spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2. The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells to initiate entry, and soluble ACE2 is a therapeutic candidate that neutralizes infection by acting as a decoy. By using deep mutagenesis, mutations in ACE2 that increase S binding are found across the interaction surface, in the asparagine 90-glycosylation motif and at buried sites. The mutational landscape provides a blueprint for understanding the specificity of the interaction between ACE2 and S and for engineering high-affinity decoy receptors. Combining mutations gives ACE2 variants with affinities that rival those of monoclonal antibodies. A stable dimeric variant shows potent SARS-CoV-2 and -1 neutralization in vitro. The engineered receptor is catalytically active, and its close similarity with the native receptor may limit the potential for viral escape.Copyright © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spread in a megacity. The purpose of the study is to analyze patterns demonstrated by the COVID-19 epidemic process in a megacity during the increase, stabilization and reduction in the incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures. Materials and methods. The comprehensive study incorporating epidemiological, molecular-genetic and statistical research methods was conducted to analyze the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Moscow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results and discussion. It was found that the exponential growth in COVID-19 cases was prevented due to the most stringent control and restrictive measures deployed in Moscow to break the chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and due to people who were very disciplined in complying with the self-isolation rules. The analysis of the dynamics in detection of new COVID-19 cases showed that in a megacity, the impact of social distancing and self-isolation would become apparent only after 3.5 incubation periods, where the maximum length of the period is 14 days. It was discovered that the detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in relatively healthy population and its dynamics are important monitoring parameters, especially during the increase and stabilization in the COVID-19 incidence, and are instrumental in predicting the development of the epidemic situation within a range of 1-2 incubation periods (14-28 days). In Moscow, the case fatality rate was 1.73% over the observation period (6/3/2020-23/6/2020). Conclusion. The epidemiological analysis of the COVID-19 situation in Moscow showed certain patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 spread and helped evaluate the effectiveness of the epidemic prevention measures aimed at breaking the routes of transmission of the pathogen.Copyright © 2020 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

0	"A review on currently available potential therapeutic options for covid-19. A series of unexplained pneumonia cases currently were first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Official names have been announced for the virus responsible, previously known as ""2019 novel coronavirus"" and the diseases it causes are, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19), respectively. Despite great efforts worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2, the spread of the virus has reached a pandemic. Infection prevention and control of this virus is the primary concern of public health officials and professionals. Currently, several therapeutic options for COVID-19 are proposed and vaccine development has been initiated for prevention purposes. In this review, we will discuss the most recent evidence about the current potential treatment options including anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma therapy. Some other agents such as vitamin D and melatonin, which were recommended as potential adjuvant treatments for COVID-19 infection are also presented. Moreover, the potential use of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 infection was described. Furthermore, in the next part of the current review, various vaccination approaches against COVID-19 including whole virus vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccine, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines are discussed.Copyright © 2020 Ohadian Moghadam."	false
0	A RECOVERED CASE OF COVID-19 MYOCARDITIS TREATED WITH IV IMMUNOGLOBULIN. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Cardiovascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of myocarditis in COVID-19 remains unknown as diagnosing myocarditis can be challenging. As per an estimate, up to 7% of death in Covid-19 might be related to myocarditis (1). CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes presented with cough and worsening dyspnea for 8 days. In ER, he was hypoxic (SpO2 75% on room air) requiring intubation for respiratory failure. Chest Xray showed bilateral diffuse opacities (Fig 1). SARS-Cov2 Rt-PCR was positive. Labs were significant for leukocytosis, elevated troponin, inflammatory markers, and abnormal liver, renal function tests (Tab 1). EKG (Fig 2) showed age indeterminate inferior infarct versus left anterior fascicular block. In the ICU, the patient was in shock with multi-organ failure requiring 4 vasoactive drugs. 2D ECHO showed EF <30% along with akinesis of the mid to apical myocardial segments (Fig 3). The shock was believed to be cardiogenic and distributive (PaSat 95%). Vancomycin and Cefepime were administered. He received Immunoglobulins (IVIG) for suspicion for viral myocarditis and pulse dose steroids for the cytokine storm. Renal replacement therapy was initiated for acute kidney injury and N acetylcysteine for acute liver injury. The patient had uncontrolled hyperglycemia requiring insulin drip. After 3 days of intensive therapy, the vasoactive agents were weaned off as the patient showed significant clinical improvement. The cultures showed no growth. EKG (Fig 4) showed nonspecific T wave changes however, myocardial infarction findings were no longer present. A repeat 2D ECHO on day 10 showed normalization of ventricular function. Despite antibiotics, he continued to be febrile with persistent leukocytosis. On day 13, Voriconazole was started for aspergillus fumigatus in respiratory culture and elevated fungitell level. By day 20, he was successfully liberated off the ventilator with minimal oxygen supplementation. He was discharged to acute rehabilitation on day 46 with outpatient hemodialysis. DISCUSSION: The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response (2). The hypothesis behind the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is that it may replace antibodies, augment viral clearance, and enhance clearance of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to myocyte destruction. IVIG therapy has been linked with the superior recovery of left ventricular function and lower mortality in patients with acute myocarditis (3). However, the use of Immunoglobulins in myocarditis remains controversial. CONCLUSION(S): In our case, early aggressive treatment of suspected myocarditis with IVIG therapy likely contributed to our patient's rapid recovery. A large randomized controlled trial is required to determine the efficacy of immunoglobulins in Covid-19 related myocarditis. Reference #1: Driggin E, Madhavan MV, Bikdeli B, et al.

0	Can data from paediatric cohorts solve the COVID-19 puzzle?. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is significantly more severe in adults than in children. The biological reasons for this difference remain to be elucidated. We have compared the most recent virological and immunological data related to COVID-19 between adults and children and contrasted this with earlier data from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the related SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. Based on these available data, a number of hypotheses are proposed to explain the difference in COVID-19 clinical outcomes between adults and children. NF-kB may be a key factor that could explain the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in adults as well as rare complications associated with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in paediatric COVID-19 patients.Copyright: © 2020 Do et al.

With interest, we have read the article by Andrey et al. on a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapid test, published in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation in October 2020.1 The authors aimed to validate the diagnostic accuracy of a recently released IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (Augurix; GaDia, Switzerland) for COVID-19. Overall, 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 45 heathy participants were enrolled in this unmatched 1:1 case-control study. With reference to the IgG recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) and CE-marked enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), sensibility (SE), specificity (SP), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated as the diagnostic accuracy estimates of Augurix IgG-RDT for COVID-19.

0	Capillary whole-blood IgG-IgM COVID-19 self-test as a serological screening tool for SARSCoV-2 infection adapted to the general public. The practicability of a prototype capillary whole-blood IgG-IgM COVID-19 self-test (Exacto COVID-19 self-test, Biosynex Swiss SA, Freiburg, Switzerland) as a serological screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection adapted to the general public was evaluated in a cross-sectional, general adult population study performed between April and May 2020 in Strasbourg, France, consisting of face-to-face, paper-based, semi-structured, and self-administrated questionnaires. Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6-100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5-23.6) asked for verbal help. The percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.5-99.4). However, misinterpretation occurred in only 2.3% of positive and 1.2% of invalid test results. Finally, all (100%) participants found that performing the COVID-19 self-test was easy; and 98.8% found the interpretation of the self-test results easy. Taken together, these pilot observations demonstrated for the first-time, high practicability and satisfaction of COVID-19 self-testing for serological IgG and IgM immune status, indicating its potential for use by the general public to complete the arsenal of available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in the urgent context of the COVID-19 epidemic.Copyright: © 2020 Tonen-Wolyec et al.

0	Development and clinical application of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strip: A multi-center assessment across China. Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is posing a threat to the public health globally. Serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody can improve early diagnosis of COVID-19 and serves as a valuable supplement to RNA detection. Method(s): A SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test strip based on colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was developed, with both spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 antigen used for antibody detection. From 3 medical institutions across China, serum or plasma of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and 300 normal controls were collected and tested with the strip. Sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Positive rates in different medical centers, age group, gender, and different disease course were compared. Result(s): 158 out 170 samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients had positive results from the test, and 296 out of 300 samples from normal controls had negative results. The kit was 92.9% sensitive and 98.7% specific. The positive rate was 77.3% during the first week after disease onset, but reached 100% since day 9. AUC and kappa coefficient were 0.958 and 0.926, respectively, which showed the consistency of the test results with the standard diagnosis. Age or gender caused little variations in the kit sensitivity. Conclusion(s): The rapid, easy-to-use SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test kit has a superior performance, which can help with accurate diagnosis and thus timely treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients, that contributes to the better control of the global pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	The association of ABO blood group with indices of disease severity and multiorgan dysfunction in COVID-19. Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) suggest a protective effect of anti-A antibodies against viral cell entry that may hold relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether ABO blood groups are associated with different severities of COVID-19. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis and nested prospective observational substudy of critically ill patients with COVID-19. We collected data pertaining to age, sex, comorbidities, dates of symptom onset, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), standard laboratory parameters, and serum inflammatory cytokines. National (N = 398671; P = .38) and provincial (n = 62246; P = .60) ABO blood group distributions did not differ from our cohort (n = 95). A higher proportion of COVID-19 patients with blood group A or AB required mechanical ventilation (P = .02) and CRRT (P = .004) and had a longer ICU stay (P = .03) compared with patients with blood group O or B. Blood group A or AB also had an increased probability of requiring mechanical ventilation and CRRT after adjusting for age, sex, and presence of >=1 comorbidity. Inflammatory cytokines did not differ between patients with blood group A or AB (n = 11) vs O or B (n = 14; P > .10 for all cytokines). Collectively, our data indicate that critically ill COVID-19 patients with blood group A or AB are at increased risk for requiring mechanical ventilation, CRRT, and prolonged ICU admission compared with patients with blood group O or B. Further work is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.	false

BACKGROUND: Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) standards is a critical component to reducing the prevalence of Health Care Acquired Infections (HAIs). The use of HH technologies is increasing and studies examining the success of these technologies on HH compliance and HAIs are important to inform standards of care. COVID-19 has emphasized compliance HH standards., METHODS: This study evaluated HH compliance and Clostridium difficile (C-difficile) rates following implementation of an HH technology at a long-term acute care hospital. The HH technology required nursing and other staff with direct patient contact to wear a ""badge"" that measured alcohol concentration on a health care worker's hands or time washing hands at designated sinks upon exit/entry of patient rooms. No changes were made to environmental cleaning or antibiotic stewardship standards. Compliance and infection rates were compared 12 months pre-post implementation during 2017-2019., RESULTS: There was an increase in HH compliance (89.82% to 97.10%, p <0.001)) and a reduction in the incidence of C-difficile (9.541 to 3.720, p=0.0032)., CONCLUSION: The HH technology significantly and quickly increased HH compliance and reduced rates of C-difficile. The technology provided ancillary benefits, including data tracing of all patient and staff contacts and cross-contamination events. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc."	false
0	First report on Cryptosporidium parvum, Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus in neonatal lambs from north-center region, Algeria. The etiology of neonatal diarrhea is multifactorial and remains one of the greatest health problems in sheep livestock farming. Faecal samples from 559 neonatal lambs aged less than 30 days from 30 sheepfolds located in the north-center region of Algeria were screened with pathogen-specific antigen ELISA for Cryptosporidium parvum, Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus. Of the 559 lambs, 312 (58.81 %), 155 (27.72 %), 72 (12.88 %) and 20 (3.57 %) were positives for C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus antigens, respectively. The prevalence of C. parvum was the highest (p < 0.0001). C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus were observed in 23 (76.66 %), 17 (56.66 %), 9 (30 %) and 3 (10 %) sheepfolds, respectively. Compared to age, the prevalence of C. parvum was highest during the second and third week of age (p < 0.001). In contrast, other pathogens were found to be more frequent in lambs aged <=7 days (p < 0.001). The number of lambs with diarrhea was 280 (50.09 %) of which 280 (100 %), 127 (45.35 %), 52 (18.57 %) and 10 (3.57 %) were found to be infected with C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus, respectively (p < 0.0001). In various combinations, mixed infections were detected only with C. parvum. This is the first report of C. parvum, E. coli K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus in <=30-days old neonatal lambs in Algeria. Special attention should be given to the first colostrum feeding, hygiene of the farm, prevention and control measures for a better prevention of neonatal diarrhea in lambs.

0	Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Antigens in Humans and Animals. To optimize the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we must first understand the antibody response to individual proteins on the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the antibody's cross reactivity to other coronaviruses. Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in naive individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on non-S1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies. We conclude that substantial variation in antibody generation against coronavirus proteins will influence interpretations of serologic data in the clinical and veterinary settings.	false

0	IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 are associated with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe disease in a subpopulation of patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients. We propose that vascular endothelial ACE2 expression focuses the pathogenic effects of these autoantibodies on blood vessels, and contributes to the angiocentric pathology observed in some severe COVID-19 patients. These findings may have predictive and therapeutic implications.	false
0	Divergent SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses in severe but not mild COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the immune response that provides specific immunity but may also lead to immunopathology is crucial for the design of potential preventive and therapeutic strategies. Here, we characterized and quantified SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses in patients with different clinical courses. Compared to individuals with a mild clinical presentation, CD4+ T cell responses were qualitatively impaired in critically ill patients. Strikingly, however, in these patients the specific IgG antibody response was remarkably strong. Furthermore, in these critically ill patients, a massive influx of circulating T cells into the lungs was observed, overwhelming the local T cell compartment, and indicative of vascular leakage. The observed disparate T and B cell responses could be indicative of a deregulated immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients. This article is protected by copyright.

0	PROTEINACEOUS COVID-19. SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is characterized by the accumulation of amorphous lipoproteins in the distal air spaces which impairs gas exchange, causing hypoxia. Incidence is around 0.2 cases per million and it is more commonly seen in males (1). Herein, we describe a rare case of PAP in a middle-aged female who was subsequently affected with COVID-19 CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old Hispanic lady with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the outpatient clinic with worsening dyspnea on exertion for 7 months and chronic cough with whitish sputum production. She was a homemaker and had no family history of any lung disease. Physical examination showed that the patient was dyspneic. The lung examination was remarkable for inspiratory crackles in bilateral lung fields. Pulmonary function tests revealed reduced FVC: 1.79L (64% of predicted) and FEV1: 1.54L (68% of predicted) with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio of 82%. DLCO was 11.2 mL/min/mmHg (55%) suggestive of moderate restrictive disease and a moderate reduction in diffusion capacity. A chest radiograph revealed diffuse interstitial opacities, computed tomography (CT) thorax confirmed the same. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy biopsies were positive for periodic acid of Schiff (PAS) lipo-proteinaceous material. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies were positive. Rituximab was started and she underwent therapeutic whole lung lavage (WLL) which relieved her symptoms. Eight months later, she presented to the emergency department with similar complaints. Initially, it was thought to be PAP flare, but vitals were remarkable for tachycardia, a saturation of 72% on room air, and a fever of 101 F. Lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis, elevated d-dimer, and ferritin. The patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. CT pulmonary angiogram revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and COVID-19 was positive. She was on vasopressors and treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, and tocilizumab. Later, she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: PAP can be complicated with infection with Nocardia species, Mycobacterium species, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, P. carinii, and viruses due to impaired macrophage function and impaired host defense which favors the growth of microorganisms. No case of COVID19 pneumonia has been reported in a patient with PAP to the best of our knowledge(2). CONCLUSION(S): The disease course of PAP varies, and the prognosis is unpredictable. WLL is the standard therapy and the 5-year survival of autoimmune PAP is 95% (3). Our patient was recently diagnosed with PAP. She had responded well to previous WLL and the prognosis was good until she was infected by COVID19, implying that it can have deleterious outcomes in PAP.

0	Complete and enduring response in an elderly patient with repeated recurrent gingival squamous cell carcinoma treated by combined toripalimab and single agent chemotherapy: a case report. Combined immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy brought about significant improvement in overall survival as the first line treatment in metastatic and recurrent head and neck cancer patients. However, in elderly patients with relatively poor performance status, these regimens might not be well tolerated. Therefore, we evaluated the safety and effect of combined immunotherapy and single agent chemotherapy in an elderly patient with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A 78-year-old male patients with a repeatedly recurrent gingival squamous cell carcinoma was admitted in our institute. Previously this patient underwent two consecutive surgical resections of recurrent tumors before the second rapid recurrence that resulted in extended tumor mass and lymph node metastasis. As the patient was in a relatively poor performance status (performance status =2), immunotherapy with PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab) combined with single agent chemotherapy (two cycle with albumin-bound paclitaxel and then six cycles with gemcitabine) was administrated, which led to clinical complete response after 8 cycles of treatment. The patient continued 4 cycles of maintenance immunotherapy with Toripalimab until the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient remained free from disease until the last follow up by June 2020, 16 months after the initiation of treatment. The success in this case indicated that the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and single chemotherapy agent may also be effective as well as safe in elderly patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	false
0	Characteristics and evaluation of the effectiveness of monitoring and control measures for the first 69 Patients with COVID-19 from 18 January 2020 to 2 March in Wuxi, China. Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused 91,305 confirmed cases and 4746 deaths in China by 13:50 on October 11, 2020. We analyzed data on 69 infections in Wuxi to describe the disease's characteristics, to analyze factors of cases clinical outcome and to evaluate the prevention and control measures., Methods: The demographic characteristics, exposure history, time indicators and propagation dynamics in Wuxi were collected., Results: The clinical severity of cases was mostly mild and normal (75.36 %). Aging (relative risk [RR] = 1.04, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.08) and fever (RR = 10.33, 95 %CI: 2.75-38.78) were risk factors for disease severity. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 4.77 days (95 % CI: 3.61-5.94), with a mean serial interval of 6.31 days (95 % CI: 5.12-7.50). The controlled reproduction number was estimated to be 1.12 (95 %CI: 0.71-1.69)., Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 in Wuxi has turned into a lower level, suggesting the early prevention and control measures have achieved effectiveness. Aging and fever of initial symptom were risk factors for severe clinical outcome. The family clusters provided further clues of the risk factors for COVID-19 transmission.

0	Chest CT Findings after 4 Months from the Onset of COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Case Series. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), computed tomography (CT) is recommended for both initial evaluation and follow-up. There is a growing body of published evidence about CT evolution during the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report six confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients who underwent unenhanced chest CT on admission and after 4 months from the onset of symptoms. Chest-CT at first admission showed the typical CT features of COVID-19. Interestingly, the follow-up CT revealed the persistence of lung abnormalities in five cases even if all the patients were completely asymptomatic. Further studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the disease progression and the resulting late imaging modifications.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: A Survey on Personal Protective Equipment Usage, Testing, and Perceptions on Disease Transmission. Background: There is a significant knowledge gap and anxiety among health care workers (HCWs) including neurosurgeons regarding in-hospital disease transmission and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic., Objective: To assess present practice and perceptions among Indian neurosurgeons with respect to type of surgeries performed, PPE usage and SARS-CoV-2 testing., Materials and Methods: A 12-item questionnaire on surgeries performed in the 6 weeks prior to the survey date, PPE usage, and preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing was circulated electronically to Indian neurosurgeons from May 12, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and their responses analyzed., Results: Two hundred forty-four neurosurgeons (237 males) participated in the survey; of whom, 230 had performed surgeries during the pandemic period. In total, 84.3% of respondents were performing semiemergency or emergency procedures only. N95 masks were utilized by only 83% of the respondents (n = 230) while performing surgical procedures. Only 40.9% of the respondents were satisfied regarding adequacy of available PPE. Preoperative SARS-CoV2 testing as well as testing of all asymptomatic patients prior to admission into ward/intensive care unit was perceived to be beneficial in reducing transmission risk by more than 85% respondents. More than 90% respondents felt that HCWs including neurosurgeons were at risk of acquiring infection through an outpatient consultation from an asymptomatic individual., Conclusions: Access to and utilization of appropriate PPE was lacking among the one-fifth of neurosurgeons who participated in this survey. To gain the confidence of neurosurgeons, hospitals should address their concerns regarding PPE and testing of patients prior to surgery and admission to the hospital.	false
0	The burden of anxiety among people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pune, India. INTRODUCTION: Globally, India has the third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited., METHODS: During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score >= 10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score >= 10 vs GAD-7 score < 10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis., RESULTS: Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income < 200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38 and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n = 41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score >= 10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p = 0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns., CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist. We recommend the regular use of short screening tools for anxiety to monitor and triage patients as an extension of current HIV services.	false

Data were collected through a questionnaire including items about demographic characters, knowledge about covid-19 and items to assess sleep quality that were extracted from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale., RESULTS: Prevalence of sleep disorders was 43.9%, doctors in the age group of 31-40 years, associate consultants had a significant higher prevalence of sleep disorders. Medical interns and laboratory/pathology/microbiology doctors had a significant more difficulty in fall asleep during COVID-19, and internists and surgeons had a significant higher percent of those who used sleeping pills. Resident doctors had a significant higher percent of having trouble in staying awake, and residents and consultants had a significant higher percent of those who suffered decreased sleep duration. Sleep quality during COVID-19 was very good, fair good and very bad in 23.4%, 60% and 3.5% of HCW respectively. The study observed a negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HCW sleep quality. Hospitals administrations should provide optimal working hours with enough break and employ more doctors during the pandemic. Doctors experiencing sleep problems should have mandatory leaves.	false

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently in worldwide pandemic state with very limited data about the mode of transmission to the growing fetus. There are a few published cases of COVID-19 infection in the infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers where most of the reported cases were either mildly symptomatic with positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or had negative COVID-19 PCR raising the question of vertical transmission. We present a case of likely intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection in a critically ill premature infant born to a COVID-19 infected mother and describing her clinical course thus far. The clinical presentation in the infant is consistent with COVID-19 infection described so far in literature along with positive PCR, and positive COVID-19 serology: immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A.

Background: COVID-19 has been the catalyst for a quantum shift in our professional and personal lives, literally and figuratively within the blink of an eyelash. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been profoundly impacted by this disruption at all levels, especially those working in high-stress specialties, such as cardiology, in resource-deprived and population-dense areas in developing countries, such as India. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on a cohort of HCWs working in a high-stress, high-turnover cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) of a tertiary care center in India. Questionnaires, results, and conclusions detailed in this presentation. Considering the fact that India has not even reached the peak of the pandemic, the negative psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on HCWs of the cardiovascular community is highly concerning and disheartening. Simplistic, sustainable long-term action plans are the need of the hour. We must use the cataclysm wrought by COVID-19 to plug our broken healthcare systems. For that, our frontline warriors should be in the best state of physical, mental, and emotional well-being to face up to this challenge. The time to take action is NOW!!

0	Identification and tracking of antiviral drug combinations. Combination therapies have become a standard for the treatment for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. They are advantageous over monotherapies due to better efficacy, reduced toxicity, as well as the ability to prevent the development of resistant viral strains and to treat viral co-infections. Here, we identify new synergistic combinations against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), echovirus 1 (EV1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. We observed synergistic activity of nelfinavir with convalescent serum and with purified neutralizing antibody 23G7 against SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. We also demonstrated synergistic activity of nelfinavir with EIDD-2801 or remdesivir in Calu-3 cells. In addition, we showed synergistic activity of vemurafenib with emetine, homoharringtonine, anisomycin, or cycloheximide against EV1 infection in human lung epithelial A549 cells. We also found that combinations of sofosbuvir with brequinar or niclosamide are synergistic against HCV infection in hepatocyte-derived Huh-7.5 cells, and that combinations of monensin with lamivudine or tenofovir are synergistic against HIV-1 infection in human cervical TZM-bl cells. These results indicate that synergy is achieved when a virus-directed antiviral is combined with another virus- or host-directed agent. Finally, we present an online resource that summarizes novel and known antiviral drug combinations and their developmental status.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Case Description: A 51-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP, presented to the ED after 3 weeks of fevers, myalgias and dyspnea in the setting of known COVID-19 infection. Labs revealed low IgG (despite IVIg infusion 3 days prior), elevated D-dimer, CRP, and a low lymphocyte count which was normal 1 month prior. Chest x-ray showed hazy bilateral opacities concerning for atypical or viral pneumonia. On admission he required supplemental oxygen. He received IVIg (500 mg/kg), was started on therapeutic anticoagulation and enrolled into a clinical trial, which randomized giving hydroxychloroquine versus placebo. Throughout his hospital course he received convalescent plasma and two doses of methylprednisolone, meanwhile his oxygen requirements remained high. On day 12 of admission, he was found with abdominal pain and severe hypotension, and an abdominal/pelvic CT revealed a new retroperitoneal bleed. He required intubation, ICU-level care, initiation of vasopressors and a massive transfusion protocol. Despite these measures, he rapidly decompensated approximately 45 days after initial diagnosis and died. Discussion(s): Fill et al hypothesized a cell-mediated response as being more important than a humoral response. Maybe our patient's earlier history of malignancy, specifically having developed DLCBL, disrupted his T-cell response beyond ability in fighting against COVID-19. Additionally, the benefits of the treatments he received have not yet been fully demonstrated. As further studies and understanding emerges, hopefully more answers will be provided.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The Integrin Binding Peptide, ATN-161, as a Novel Therapy for SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Many efforts to design and screen therapeutics for the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have focused on inhibiting viral host cell entry by disrupting ACE2 binding with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This work focuses on the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry through a hypothesized alpha5beta1 integrin-based mechanism, and indicates that inhibiting the spike protein interaction with alpha5beta1 integrin (+/- ACE2), and the interaction between alpha5beta1 integrin and ACE2 using a novel molecule ATN-161 represents a promising approach to treat COVID-19.

0	Assessment of preventive measures application against covid-19 in the workplace. Background: The number of cases of SARS-Cov-2 contamination in Setif (Algeria) is constantly increasing, representing to date nearly 10% of all cases recorded throughout the country. Aim(s): To evaluate the preventive measures taken by the service sector companies against the spread of the virus. Method(s): A survey of 115 service sector companies was carried out in the prefecture of Setif (Algeria). The data was collected using a pre-established questionnaire completed with one of the officials of the company and by direct observation. Result(s): A high prevalence (42%) of women put on leave was found. Physical meetings were held in 38% of the companies, hydroalcoholic solution was available for employees in 85% and for customers only in 4%. In more than 70% of cases, disinfection of surfaces, floors and door handles took place frequently. Safety distance between employees and customers was respected in 88%, between employees in 66% and between customers in 63% of the companies. The wearing of a mask by all, the majority, some and none of the employees was observed in respectively 15%, 17%, 39% and 29% of the companies. Conclusion(s): The preventive measures against the risk of contamination by Covid-19 infection taken in the visited companies were considered insufficient. An awareness campaign has been initiated to correct the shortcomings observed.Copyright © 2020, Maison du Medicine. All rights reserved.	false
0	Animals and SARS-CoV-2: Species susceptibility and viral transmission in experimental and natural conditions, and the potential implications for community transmission. The current COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of probable bat origin, has highlighted the ongoing need for a One Health response to emerging zoonotic disease events. Understanding the human-animal interface and its relevance to disease transmission remains a critical control point for many emerging zoonoses. Determination of the susceptibility of various animal species to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the role of animals in the epidemiology of the disease will be critical to informing appropriate human and veterinary public health responses to this pandemic. A scoping literature review was conducted to collect, evaluate and present the available research evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals. Experimental studies have successfully demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, hamsters, bats and non-human primates under experimental settings. Dogs appear to have limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, while other domestic species including pigs and poultry do not appear susceptible. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals appear uncommon, with 14 pets, 8 captive big cats and an unreported number of farmed mink testing positive to date. Infections typically appear asymptomatic in dogs, while clinical signs of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease tend to be mild to moderate in felines, and severe to fatal in mink. Most animals are presumed to have been infected by close contact with COVID-19 patients. In domestic settings, viral transmission is self-limiting, however in high density animal environments there can be sustained between-animal transmission. To date, two potential cases of animal-to-human transmission are being investigated, on infected mink farms. Given the millions of COVID-19 cases worldwide and ongoing potential for further zoonotic and anthroponotic viral transmission, further research and surveillance activities are needed to definitively determine the role of animals in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

0	An Updated Understanding of the Current Emerging Respiratory Infection: COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 pandemic has been declared as a priority disease. Some patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of multiple organ failure and death. The published articles on COVID-19 infection were reviewed. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not completely established. Person-to-person transmission via droplets, probable aerosols, or close contact is considered as the main mode of transmission. With increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2, valuable clinical indicators or treatments should be further identified and summarized. CT scanning plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients or those with initially negative RT-PCR results. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended, except the main supportive treatments, and effective measures should be taken into consideration to protect important organs and prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe infection.

0	Care for Patients with Stroke During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Suggestions for Preventing Secondary Stroke. Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the development of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and associated clinical symptoms, which typically presents as an upper respiratory syndrome such as pneumonia. Growing evidence indicates an increased prevalence of neurological involvement (e.g., in the form of stroke) during virus infection. COVID-19 has been suggested to be more than a lung infection because it affects the vasculature of the lungs and other organs and increases the risk of thrombosis. Patients with stroke are vulnerable to secondary events as a result not only of their poor vascular condition but also of their lack of access to rehabilitation resources. Herein, we review current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of COVID-19, its possible association with neurological involvement, and current drug therapies. Suggestions are also offered regarding the potential for current neurorehabilitation therapies to be taught and practiced at home. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Transfusion Reactions Associated with COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Therapy for SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has shown preliminary signs of effectiveness in moderate to severely ill patients in reducing mortality1, 2 . While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to convalescent plasma is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult COVID-19 patients within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the FDA eIND and EAP approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed., RESULTS: Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and thirteen were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile non-hemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), allergic (1.8%), and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12-13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80-89 years., CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of CP as a safe therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.

0	Serum Cystatin C and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Potential Inflammatory Biomarker in Predicting Critical Illness and Mortality for Adult Patients. This study aimed at determining the relationship between baseline cystatin C levels and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and investigating the potential prognostic value of serum cystatin C in adult patients with COVID-19. 481 patients with COVID-19 were consecutively included in this study from January 2, 2020, and followed up to April 15, 2020. All clinical and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients with definite outcomes were reviewed. For every measure, COVID-19 patients were grouped into quartiles according to the baseline levels of serum cystatin C. The highest cystatin C level was significantly related to more severe inflammatory conditions, worse organ dysfunction, and worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 (P values < 0.05). In the adjusted logistic regression analyses, the highest cystatin C level and ln-transformed cystatin C levels were independently associated with the risks of developing critically ill COVID-19 and all-cause death either in overall patients or in patients without chronic kidney disease (P values < 0.05). As a potential inflammatory marker, increasing baseline levels of serum cystatin C might independently predict adverse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Serum cystatin C could be routinely monitored during hospitalization, which showed clinical importance in prognosticating for adult patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Dan Chen et al.	false
0	Corona Virus Infectious Disease 19 (COVID-19) in Various Reviews. The current COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. It accesses host cells through the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which is expressed by endothelial cells (EC) and very abundantly expressed in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 uses a surface glycoprotein (peplomer) called a spike to access host cells and ACE2 has been revealed to be a co-receptor for coronavirus entry. The antigen presentation of SARS-CoV mainly depends on the MHC I molecule, but MHC II also contributes to the presentation. Based on the mechanism of a common acute viral infection, the antibody profile against the SARS-CoV virus contains characteristic pattern of IgM and IgG production. By the end of week 12, SARS-specific IgM antibodies disappear, whereas IgG antibodies can last in a longer period of time, which shows IgG antibodies can mainly hold a protective role, and SARS-specific IgG antibodies mainly are S-specific and N-specific antibodies. Clinical manifestations are not only found in mucosa in the airways but also in the cardiovascular system, kidneys, central nervous system, pregnancy, skin, oral cavity and digestive system. The diagnose of clinical presentation of COVID-19 is mainly based on a history of epidemiology, clinical manifestations of pneumonia symptoms (for example, fever, dry cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath) and several additional examinations, include detection of nucleic acids, CT scanning, immune identification technology (POCT) ) IgM / IgG, related to enzymes, immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and blood culture.Copyright © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

0	Evidence-based point-of-care technology development during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China has spread to nearly every continent and become a global health concern. Although much has been discovered about COVID-19 and its pathogenesis, the WHO has identified an immediate need to increase the levels of testing for COVID-19 and identify the stages of the disease accurately for appropriate action to be taken by clinicians and emergency care units. Harnessing technology for accurate diagnosis and staging will improve patient outcomes and minimize serious consequences of false-positive test results. Point-of-care technologies aim to intervene at every stage of the disease to quickly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers and stratify them for timely treatment. This requires the tests to be rapid, accurate, sensitive, simple to use and compatible with many body fluids. Mobile platforms are optimal for remote, small-scale deployment, whereas facility-based platforms at hospital centers and laboratory settings offer higher throughput. Here we review evidence-based point-of-care technologies in the context of the entire continuum of COVID-19, from early screening to treatment, and discuss their impact on improving patient outcomes.	false
0	Chest CT in COVID-19: What the Radiologist Needs to Know. Chest CT has a potential role in the diagnosis, detection of complications, and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Implementation of appropriate precautionary safety measures, chest CT protocol optimization, and a standardized reporting system based on the pulmonary findings in this disease will enhance the clinical utility of chest CT. However, chest CT examinations may lead to both false-negative and false-positive results. Furthermore, the added value of chest CT in diagnostic decision making is dependent on several dynamic variables, most notably available resources (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] tests, personal protective equipment, CT scanners, hospital and radiology personnel availability, and isolation room capacity) and the prevalence of both COVID-19 and other diseases with overlapping manifestations at chest CT. Chest CT is valuable to detect both alternative diagnoses and complications of COVID-19 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure), while its role for prognostication requires further investigation. The authors describe imaging and managing care of patients with COVID-19, with topics including (a) chest CT protocol, (b) chest CT findings of COVID-19 and its complications, (c) the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT and its role in diagnostic decision making and prognostication, and (d) reporting and communicating chest CT findings. The authors also review other specific topics, including the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the World Health Organization case definition, the value of performing RT-PCR tests, and the radiology department and personnel impact related to performing chest CT in COVID-19. ©RSNA, 2020.	false
0	The Role of Molecular Chaperones in Virus Infection and Implications for Understanding and Treating COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic made imperative the search for means to end it, which requires a knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the multiplication and spread of its cause, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many viruses use members of the hosts' chaperoning system to infect the target cells, replicate, and spread, and here we present illustrative examples. Unfortunately, the role of chaperones in the SARS-CoV-2 cycle is still poorly understood. In this review, we examine the interactions of various coronaviruses during their infectious cycle with chaperones in search of information useful for future research on SARS-CoV-2. We also call attention to the possible role of molecular mimicry in the development of autoimmunity and its widespread pathogenic impact in COVID-19 patients. Viral proteins share highly antigenic epitopes with human chaperones, eliciting anti-viral antibodies that crossreact with the chaperones. Both, the critical functions of chaperones in the infectious cycle of viruses and the possible role of these molecules in COVID-19 autoimmune phenomena, make clear that molecular chaperones are promising candidates for the development of antiviral strategies. These could consist of inhibiting-blocking those chaperones that are necessary for the infectious viral cycle, or those that act as autoantigens in the autoimmune reactions causing generalized destructive effects on human tissues.	false
0	Cardiac sequelae of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a clinical case series. Background: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 most commonly manifests with fever and respiratory illness. The cardiovascular manifestations have become more prevalent but can potentially go unrecognized. We look to describe cardiac manifestations in three patients with COVID-19 using cardiac enzymes, electrocardiograms, and echocardiography., Case summaries: The first patient, a 67-year-old Caucasian female with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, presented with dyspnoea on exertion and orthopnoea 1 week after testing positive for COVID-19. Echocardiogram revealed large pericardial effusion with findings consistent with tamponade. A pericardial drain was placed, and fluid studies were consistent with viral pericarditis, treated with colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone. Follow-up echocardiograms showed apical hypokinesis, that later resolved, consistent with Takotsubo syndrome. The second patient, a 46-year-old African American male with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with fevers, cough, and dyspnoea due to COVID-19. Clinical course was complicated with pulseless electrical activity arrest; he was found to have D-dimer and troponin elevation, and inferior wall ST elevation on ECG concerning for STEMI due to microemboli. The patient succumbed to the illness. The third patient, a 76-year-old African American female with hypertension, presented with diarrhoea, fever, and myalgia, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Clinical course was complicated, with acute troponin elevation, decreased cardiac index, and severe hypokinesis of the basilar wall suggestive of reverse Takotsubo syndrome. The cardiac index improved after pronation and non-STEMI therapy; however, the patient expired due to worsening respiratory status., Discussion: These case reports demonstrate cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 that required monitoring and urgent intervention.

0	Serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection and analysis of IgG non-responders. BACKGROUND: To accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset., METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels were quantified using two clinically validated and widely used commercial serological assays (Architect, Abbott Laboratories and iFlash 1800, YHLO), detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid proteins., RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P = 0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys.	false
0	Associations between COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief with COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors: A cross-sectional online study. BACKGROUND: Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern. OBJECTIVE(S): We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified from the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the association of misinformation receipt with socio-demographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief and psychological distress, and the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018. RESULT(S): 67.78% respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (1.79, 1.27-2.51) sources of information. Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (1.47, 1.09-2.00), and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (7.33, 5.17-10.38). Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (High: 0.62, 0.45-0.84), and fewer preventive behaviors (>= 7 behaviors: 0.54, 0.39-0.74). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of undermining global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter proliferation of misinformation.	false
0	Transmission of covid 19 through eyes - review article. The Corona virus Covid19 is a severe respiratory disorder which is caused due to infection, previously known as 2019-nCoV. The infection is caused due to the contagious virus, which leads to a severe respiratory disease known as COVID-19. Patients who are suffering from conjunctivitis, fever, cough and shortness of breath and those who traveled from hots spot area of corona virus or their family members are suffering from corona virus come to an ophthalmologist could be the patient suffering from corona virus or may have an infection due to covid19. Conjunctivitis patients coming from regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19, come to an ophthalmologist could be suffered from corona virus. The corona virus genome is a single-stranded RNA that causes COVID-19. The corona virus is a contagious disease which spreads from person to person through their respiratory droplets of an infected person after their coughing and sneezing. A healthy person could be infected by corona virus if people touch an object or surface with virus present from an infected person, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. In some recent articles and reports, it is suggested that corona virus can cause conjunctivitis either as an early sign or during hospitalization during severe covid19. There are chances of spreading of corona virus to eyes through aerosols or due to hands to eye contact. Covid19 patients have single-stranded RNA virus throughout the body and also in the tears of eyes, but there is no evidence of corona virus cultured in the conjunctiva of eyes. Conjunctiva congestion and follicular conjunctivitis are found in patients having confirmed diagnosis of covid19.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences Production and Hosted by Pharmascope	false
0	Incidence, patterns, risk factors, and histopathological findings of liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a scoping review. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits many extrapulmonary manifestations, including liver injury. This scoping review aimed to provide insight into the incidence, patterns, risk factors, histopathological findings, and relationship with disease severity of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Furthermore, we identified existing gaps in the research on the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and highlighted areas for future investigations., METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis., RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult., CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised. Current use of hepatotoxic drugs necessitates close monitoring of liver function.	false

0	Analytical and clinical performances of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in comparison with neutralization activity. BACKGROUND: Reliable high-throughput serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed for the effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is of crucial importance to understand the strength and duration of immunity after infection, and to make informed decisions concerning the activation or discontinuation of physical distancing restrictions., METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)., FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R2adj = 0.569)., INTERPRETATION: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing a better management of COVID-19 patients, effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus., FUNDING: None.

0	MCCS: a novel recognition pattern-based method for fast track discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Given the scale and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or 2019-nCoV), there is an urgent need to identify therapeutics that are effective against COVID-19 before vaccines are available. Since the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 knowledge acquisition via traditional research methods is not sufficient to match the rapid spread of the virus, novel strategies of drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 infection are required. Structure-based virtual screening for example relies primarily on docking scores and does not take the importance of key residues into consideration, which may lead to a significantly higher incidence rate of false-positive results. Our novel in silico approach, which overcomes these limitations, can be utilized to quickly evaluate FDA-approved drugs for repurposing and combination, as well as designing new chemical agents with therapeutic potential for COVID-19. As a result, anti-HIV or antiviral drugs (lopinavir, tenofovir disoproxil, fosamprenavir and ganciclovir), antiflu drugs (peramivir and zanamivir) and an anti-HCV drug (sofosbuvir) are predicted to bind to 3CLPro in SARS-CoV-2 with therapeutic potential for COVID-19 infection by our new protocol. In addition, we also propose three antidiabetic drugs (acarbose, glyburide and tolazamide) for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we apply our new virus chemogenomics knowledgebase platform with the integrated machine-learning computing algorithms to identify the potential drug combinations (e.g. remdesivir+chloroquine), which are congruent with ongoing clinical trials. In addition, another 10 compounds from CAS COVID-19 antiviral candidate compounds dataset are also suggested by Molecular Complex Characterizing System with potential treatment for COVID-19. Our work provides a novel strategy for the repurposing and combinations of drugs in the market and for prediction of chemical candidates with anti-COVID-19 potential.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Pediatric COVID-19 and the factors that may mitigate its clinical course. The clinical manifestations of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary from mild flu-like symptoms to severe fatal pneumonia. However, children with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic ormay have mild clinical symptoms. The aimof this study was to investigate clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 and to search for the factors that may mitigate the disease course. We reviewed the literature to realize the clinical features, laboratory, and radiographic data that may be diagnostic for COVID-19 among children. Also, we studied the factors that may affect the clinical course of the disease. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are the main symptoms of pediatric COVID-19, sometimes flu-like symptoms and/or gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. Although some infected children may be asymptomatic, a recent unusual hyperinflammatory reaction with overlapping features of Kawasaki's disease and toxic shock syndrome in pediatric COVID-19 has been occasionally reported. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronvirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid testing is the cornerstone method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count and other inflammatory markers are not essentially diagnostic; however, chest computed tomography is highly specific. Factors that may mitigate the severity of pediatric COVID-19 are home confinement with limited children activity, trained immunity caused by compulsory vaccination, the response of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in children is not the same as in adults, and that children are less likely to have comorbidities. As infected children may be asymptomatic or may have only mild respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms that might be missed, all children for families who have a member diagnosed with COVID-19 should be investigated.

0	Harnessing the immune system to overcome cytokine storm and reduce viral load in COVID-19: a review of the phases of illness and therapeutic agents. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCov), a novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization by March 11th, 2020. Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a combination of direct tissue injury by viral replication and associated cytokine storm resulting in progressive organ damage. Discussion(s): We reviewed published literature between January 1st, 2000 and June 30th, 2020, excluding articles focusing on pediatric or obstetric population, with a focus on virus-host interactions and immunological mechanisms responsible for virus associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). COVID-19 illness encompasses three main phases. In phase 1, SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, triggering toll like receptor (TLR) mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling. It effectively blunts an early (IFN) response allowing unchecked viral replication. Phase 2 is characterized by hypoxia and innate immunity mediated pneumocyte damage as well as capillary leak. Some patients further progress to phase 3 characterized by cytokine storm with worsening respiratory symptoms, persistent fever, and hemodynamic instability. Important cytokines involved in this phase are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. This is typically followed by a recovery phase with production of antibodies against the virus. We summarize published data regarding virus-host interactions, key immunological mechanisms responsible for virus-associated CRS, and potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Conclusion(s): Evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with CRS and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and other therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Covid-19: What is the best approach in gynecological oncology patient management during the coronavirus pandemic?. Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is a new major concern and a global emergency in almost all countries worldwide; due to the higher sensibility of cancer patients, they are more susceptible to severe and fatal infections, being nearly 10 times more likely than in healthy individuals infected with this virus. Although the aggressive nature of a cancer is a matter of concern, our exact role as oncologists in this time of restricted resources is not fully clarified. Regarding some consensus recommendation for postponing surgery, there is still an essential need for a single approved protocol regarding each type of malignancy. Iran, as one of the first involved countries in this crisis in Asia, which also has a high prevalence of gynecological malignancies, will certainly require an individualized decision-making schedule based on the most accepted global consensus opinion. Considering our restricted health system resources, herein we tried to introduce a logical gynecologic cancer management protocol based on the stage and survival expectancy of each tumor, along with reviewing all recent recommendations. The limited statistics published in this short period of time have obliged us to mainly focus on expert opinions, and the individualized clinical judgments should be agreed upon by multidisciplinary tumor board consensus. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadows all aspects of medicine, and decision making in gynecological oncology patients requires precise and appropriate judgment based on the available local resources.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd	false
0	Dysfunction of adaptive immunity is related to severity of COVID-19: a retrospective study. Background: In December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, and has now rapidly swept around the world. Much research has been carried out since the outbreak, but few studies have focused on the dysfunction of the adaptive immunity. Method(s): In this retrospective and multi-center study, 373 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Affiliated Hospital of Putian University were recruited. Demographic, clinical, radiological features, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed at admission and at discharge. Results of immunological tests were followed up until the patients were discharged. Result(s): Of the 373 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 322 were in the non-severe group and 51 were in the severe group. Number of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes declined remarkably upon admission and elevated when the patients were discharged. At admission, counts of total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and levels of C3 and C4 in the severe group were lower than those in the non-severe group, whereas the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in the severe group. Counts of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes were negatively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 might target adaptive immunity and cause a decrease in lymphocytes, especially T cells and subsets. Physicians should pay close attention to the adaptive immunity of patients upon admission. Monitoring NLR, T lymphocytes, and subsets would help physicians with the proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Globally the year 2020 recognized as the ""Year of COVID-19"" gets a popularity as a virus without break in the history of medical science because its spreadability is very high as shown by its latest figures till 03rd August 2020, approximately 18,233,977 of confirmed cases with 6,92,785 of deaths as per World Health Organization. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the universal gift of China is a genetically strong virus with extraordinary proteinous makeup. The severity of coronavirus increase continuously due to numerous climatological and sociobiological factors results in symptomatic to asymptomatic spread of infection. Till date, there is no any vaccine except the supportive and preventive strategies as given by the regulatory authorities. This current outbreak not only become the physical threat to the global population but also affects the psychological ability of every human being with the fear, the unseen psychological weapon of coronavirus. Therefore, learning from previous virulent pandemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, presently the countries take a new advanced innovative step via digital infrastructure to control the spread of this deadly virus. However, from the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak and during this lockdown time, the techno world psychological supporting media and apps getting popularity continuously and becoming a psychological healer to a great extent.

0	Potential approaches to combat COVID-19: a mini-review. The outbreak of a novel coronavirus namely SARS-CoV-2, which first emerged from Wuhan, China, has wreaked havoc not only in China but the whole world that now has been engulfed in its wrath. In a short lapse of time, this virus was successful in spreading at a blistering pace throughout the globe, hence raising the flag of pandemic status. The mounting number of deaths with each elapsing day has summoned researchers from all around the world to play their part in driving this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to an end. As of now, multiple research teams are immersed in either scrutinizing various antiviral drugs for their efficacy or developing different types of vaccines that will be capable of providing long-term immunity against this deadly virus. The mini-review sheds light on the possible approaches that can be undertaken to curb the COVID-19 spread. Possible strategies comprise viral vector-based, nucleic acid-based, protein-based, inactivated and weakened virus vaccines; COVID-19 vaccine being developed by deploying Hyleukin-7 technology; plant-based chimeric protein and subunit vaccines; humanized nano-bodies and human antibodies; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion therapy; inhibitors for ACE-2, Angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R), complement system, viral proteins, host cell protease and endocytosis; shield immunity; IL-6R, NKG2A and hACE2-SARS-CoV-2-RBD interaction blocking monoclonal antibodies; SARS-CoV RdRp-based drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, repositioned and anti-viral drugs. These vaccines and drugs are currently being screened in the clinical trials as several of them have manifested positive results, hence increasing the probability of becoming one of the potential treatments for this disease.	false
0	Identification of Immunohistochemical Reagents for In Situ Protein Expression Analysis of Coronavirus-associated Changes in Human Tissues. We studied the suitability of commercially available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in standard archival specimens. Antibodies were screened on HEK293 cells transfected with viral nucleoprotein, S1 subunit and S2 subunit of spike protein and on untransfected cells, as well as a panel of normal tissue. Lung tissue with presence of SARS-CoV2 confirmed by in situ hybridization (ISH) was also used. A total of 7 mAbs were tested: (1) mAb 001 (Sino Biological, 40143-R001), (2) mAb 007 (Sino Biological, 40150-R007), (3) mAb 019 (Sino Biological, 40143-R019), (4) mAb 1A9 (GeneTex, GTX632604), (5) mAb ABM19C9 (Abeomics, 10-10007), (6) FIPV3-70 (Santa Cruz, SC-65653), and (7) mAb 6F10 (BioVision, A2060). Only 2 mAbs, clone 001 to the nucleoprotein and clone 1A9 to the S2 subunit spike protein displayed specific immunoreactivity. Both clones showed strong staining in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia, mostly in areas of acute diffuse alveolar damage, but were not completely congruent. Viral protein was also found in kidney tubules, endothelia of multiple organs and a nasal swab of a patient with persistent SARS-CoV2 infection. The other tested reagents were either poorly reactive or demonstrated nonspecific staining in tissues and lesions not infected by SARS-CoV2. Our study demonstrates that rigid specificity testing is mandatory for the evaluation of mAbs to SARS-CoV2 and that clones 001 to nucleoprotein and 1A9 to S2 subunit spike protein are useful for the in situ detection of SARS-CoV2.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Infections in the World: An Estimation of the Infected Population and a Measure of How Higher Detection Rates Save Lives. This paper provides an estimation of the accumulated detection rates and the accumulated number of infected individuals by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Worldwide, on July 20, it has been estimated above 160 million individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it is found that only about 1 out of 11 infected individuals are detected. In an information context in which population-based seroepidemiological studies are not frequently available, this study shows a parsimonious alternative to provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. By comparing our estimates with those provided by the population-based seroepidemiological ENE-COVID study in Spain, we confirm the utility of our approach. Then, using a cross-country regression, we investigated if differences in detection rates are associated with differences in the cumulative number of deaths. The hypothesis investigated in this study is that higher levels of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections can reduce the risk exposure of the susceptible population with a relatively higher risk of death. Our results show that, on average, detecting 5 instead of 35 percent of the infections is associated with multiplying the number of deaths by a factor of about 6. Using this result, we estimated that 120 days after the pandemic outbreak, if the US would have tested with the same intensity as South Korea, about 85,000 out of their 126,000 reported deaths could have been avoided.	false
0	Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with neuromyelitis optica and associated disorders. BACKGROUND: Outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), often treated with immunosuppressive therapies, are still unknown., METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study among all French expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders. Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and June 30th , 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity score assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7 (death)., RESULTS: Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3] years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3%) were hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or azathioprine (3). They were younger (mean [SD] age: 37.0 [13.4] years), with a longer disease duration (mean [SD]: 8.3 [6.3] years) and had a lower EDSS score (median [range] EDSS: 2.5 [0-4]) relative to patients requiring hospitalization (mean [SD] age: 44.0 [16.4] years, mean [SD] disease duration: 5.8 [5.5] years, median [range] EDSS: 4 [0-6.5])., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcome was overall favorable in this cohort. Larger international studies are needed to identify risk factors of severe COVID-19, however we recommend personal protective measures to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this immunocompromised population.

0	Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 161 discharged cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shanghai, China. Background: In December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to other regions. We aimed to further describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of discharged COVID-19 cases and evaluate the public health interventions. Method(s): We collected epidemiological and clinical data of all discharged COVID-19 cases as of 17 February 2020 in Shanghai. The key epidemiological distributions were estimated and outcomes were also compared between patients whose illness were before 24 January and those whose illness were after 24 January. Result(s): Of 161 discharged COVID-19 cases, the median age was 45 years, and 80 (49.7%) cases were male. All of the cases were categorized as clinical moderate type. The most common initial symptoms were fever (85.7%), cough (41.0%), fatigue (19.3%), muscle ache (17.4%), sputum production (14.9%), and there were six asymptomatic cases. 39 (24.2%) cases got infected in Shanghai, and three of them were second-generation cases of Shanghai native cases. The estimated median of the time from onset to first medical visit, admission, disease confirmation, and discharge for 161 cases was 1.0 day (95% CI, 0.6-1.2), 2.0 days (95% CI, 1.5-2.6), 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.6-5.7), 18.1 days (95% CI, 17.4-18.8), respectively. The estimated median of the time from admission to discharge was 14.0 days (95% CI, 13.3-14.6). The time from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response. In Cox regression model, the significant independent covariates for the duration of hospitalization were age, the time from onset to admission and the first-level public health emergency response. Conclusion(s): Local transmission had occurred in Shanghai in late January 2020. The estimated median of the time from onset to discharge of moderate COVID-19 was 18.1 days in Shanghai. Time intervals from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghai's first-level public health emergency response. Age, the first-level public health emergency response and the time from onset to admission were the impact factors for the duration of hospitalization.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Complicating Infections Associated with Common Endemic Human Respiratory Coronaviruses. Coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are endemic human respiratory coronaviruses that typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory infections, similar to the common cold. They also may cause simple and complicated lower respiratory infections, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, gastroenteritis, and a few systemic complications. These viruses are usually seasonal (with winter dominance) and affect nearly all age groups. The seasonal and annual variation in virus prevalence has implications for understanding the concept of acquired immunity and its persistence or diminution. Coronaviruses generally have outbreak potential in susceptible populations of any age, particularly in patients with comorbidities, who tend to have increased clinical disease. These 4 coronaviruses are often found in the context of what appears to be coinfection with other pathogens, but especially other viruses. If coronaviruses are not specifically tested for, the sole detection of a viral copathogen would suggest the pathogen is the causative agent, when a coronavirus may be culpable, or both. The detection of these viruses in circumstances where respiratory viruses are generally sought in clinical samples is, therefore, justified. These pathogens can be chronically shed from the respiratory tract, which is more likely to occur among immunocompromised and complicated patients. These viruses share the potential for genetic drift. The genome is among the largest of RNA viruses, and the capability of these viruses to further change is likely underestimated. Given the potential disease among humans, it is justified to search for effective antiviral chemotherapy for these viruses and to consider uses in niche situations should effective therapy be defined. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 may follow the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV and extinguish slowly over time, there is yet concern that SARS-CoV-2 may establish itself as an endemic human respiratory coronavirus similar to OC43, 2299E, NL63, and HKU1. Until sufficient data are acquired to better understand the potential of SARS-CoV-2, continued work on antiviral therapy and vaccination is imperative.	false
0	Generation of Chicken IgY against SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein and Epitope Mapping. This new decade has started with a global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), precipitating a worldwide health crisis and economic downturn. Scientists and clinicians have been racing against time to find therapies for COVID-19. Repurposing approved drugs, developing vaccines and employing passive immunization are three major therapeutic approaches to fighting COVID-19. Chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY) has the potential to be used as neutralizing antibody against respiratory infections, and its advantages include high avidity, low risk of adverse immune responses, and easy local delivery by intranasal administration. In this study, we raised antibody against the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in chickens and extracted IgY (called IgY-S) from egg yolk. IgY-S exhibited high immunoreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 S, and by epitope mapping, we found five linear epitopes of IgY-S in SARS-CoV-2 S, two of which are cross-reactive with SARS-CoV S. Notably, epitope SIIAYTMSL, one of the identified epitopes, partially overlaps the S1/S2 cleavage region in SARS-CoV-2 S and is located on the surface of S trimer in 3D structure, close to the S1/S2 cleavage site. Thus, antibody binding at this location could physically block the access of proteolytic enzymes to S1/S2 cleavage site and thereby impede S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage, which is crucial to subsequent virus-cell membrane fusion and viral cell entry. Therefore, the feasibility of using IgY-S or epitope SIIAYTMS-specific IgY as neutralizing antibody for preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is worth exploring.

0	The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein as a drug and vaccine target: Structural insights into its complexes with ACE2 and antibodies. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has so far resulted in more than 1.1 M deaths and 40 M cases worldwide with no confirmed remedy yet available. Since the first outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, researchers across the globe have been in a race to develop therapies and vaccines against the disease. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other previously identified Coronaviridae family members, encodes several structural proteins, such as spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, that are responsible for host penetration, binding, recycling, and pathogenesis. Structural biology has been a key player in understanding the viral infection mechanism and in developing intervention strategies against the new coronavirus. The spike glycoprotein has drawn considerable attention as a means to block viral entry owing to its interactions with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor. Here, we review the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with ACE2 and antibodies. Structural information of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 and antibodies can provide key input for the development of therapies and vaccines against the new coronavirus.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Non-infectious status indicated by detectable IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2. A key tenet of protection from infection for dentists is to know who is not infectious. The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor. Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (>99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures. Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive. It remains to be seen whether SARS-Cov-2 vaccine responses include protective IgG titres and, once vaccines become widespread, can be used to assist decision-making on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in dentistry.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 immunity: review and applications to phase 3 vaccine candidates. Understanding immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is crucial to understanding disease pathogenesis and the usefulness of bridge therapies, such as hyperimmune globulin and convalescent human plasma, and to developing vaccines, antivirals, and monoclonal antibodies. A mere 11 months ago, the canvas we call COVID-19 was blank. Scientists around the world have worked collaboratively to fill in this blank canvas. In this Review, we discuss what is currently known about human humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and relate this knowledge to the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	N-terminally truncated nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a better serological marker than whole nucleocapsid protein in evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a serious public health crisis, and no specific treatments or vaccines are available yet. A nucleocapsid protein (NP)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection method is not only important in disease diagnosis, but is required for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy during the development of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we expressed both the NP and N-terminally truncated NP (DELTAN-NP) of SARS-CoV-2 in an Escherichia coli expression system and described the purification of the soluble recombinant NP and DELTAN-NP in details. The identities of the NP and DELTAN-NP were confirmed with mass spectrometry. We then used immunoglobulin G detection ELISAs to compare the sensitivity of NP and DELTAN-NP in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DELTAN-NP showed greater sensitivity than NP in the analysis of serially diluted sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with inactive SARS-CoV-2 and in human sera diluted 1:400. DELTAN-NP showed a positive detection rate similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in human sera. We conclude that DELTAN-NP is a better serological marker than NP for evaluating the immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

0	Deep mutagenesis in the study of COVID-19: a technical overview for the proteomics community. Introduction: The spike (S) of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on a host cell to trigger viral-cell membrane fusion and infection. The extracellular region of ACE2 can be administered as a soluble decoy to compete for binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S, but it has only moderate affinity and efficacy. The RBD, which is targeted by neutralizing antibodies, may also change and adapt through mutation as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, posing challenges for therapeutic and vaccine development. Areas Covered: Deep mutagenesis is a Big Data approach to characterizing sequence variants. A deep mutational scan of ACE2 expressed on human cells identified mutations that increase S affinity and guided the engineering of a potent and broad soluble receptor decoy. A deep mutational scan of the RBD displayed on the surface of yeast has revealed residues tolerant of mutational changes that may act as a source for drug resistance and antigenic drift. Expert Opinion: Deep mutagenesis requires a selection of diverse sequence variants; an in vitro evolution experiment that is tracked with next-generation sequencing. The choice of expression system, diversity of the variant library and selection strategy have important consequences for data quality and interpretation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Synthetic Biology-derived triterpenes as efficacious immunomodulating adjuvants. The triterpene oil squalene is an essential component of nanoemulsion vaccine adjuvants. It is most notably in the MF59 adjuvant, a component in some seasonal influenza vaccines, in stockpiled, emulsion-based adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, and with demonstrated efficacy for vaccines to other pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Squalene has historically been harvested from shark liver oil, which is undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of a Synthetic Biology (yeast) production platform to generate squalene and novel triterpene oils, all of which are equally as efficacious as vaccine adjuvants based on physiochemical properties and immunomodulating activities in a mouse model. These Synthetic Biology adjuvants also elicited similar IgG1, IgG2a, and total IgG levels compared to marine and commercial controls when formulated with common quadrivalent influenza antigens. Injection site morphology and serum cytokine levels did not suggest any reactogenic effects of the yeast-derived squalene or novel triterpenes, suggesting their safety in adjuvant formulations. These results support the advantages of yeast produced triterpene oils to include completely controlled growth conditions, just-in-time and scalable production, and the capacity to produce novel triterpenes beyond squalene.	false
0	Correlates of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans: The contribution of lifetime tobacco use. Despite a growing body of research examining correlates and consequences of COVID-19, few findings have been published among military veterans. This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables. Findings highlight the importance of assessing for lifetime tobacco use among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the relative importance of lifetime tobacco use as a risk factor for increased mortality.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Assessment of social distancing for controlling covid-19 in korea: An age-structured modeling approach. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred all over the world between 2019 and 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, there have been more than 21 million incidences and 761 thousand casualties worldwide as of 16 August 2020. One of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 is that its symptoms and fatality rates vary with the ages of the infected individuals. This study aims at assessing the impact of social distancing on the reduction of COVID-19 infected cases by constructing a mathematical model and using epidemiological data of incidences in Korea. We developed an age-structured mathematical model for describing the age-dependent dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in Korea. We estimated the model parameters and computed the reproduction number using the actual epidemiological data reported from 1 February to 15 June 2020. We then divided the data into seven distinct periods depending on the intensity of social distancing implemented by the Korean government. By using a contact matrix to describe the contact patterns between ages, we investigated the potential effect of social distancing under various scenarios. We discovered that when the intensity of social distancing is reduced, the number of COVID-19 cases increases; the number of incidences among the age groups of people 60 and above increases significantly more than that of the age groups below the age of 60. This significant increase among the elderly groups poses a severe threat to public health because the incidence of severe cases and fatality rates of the elderly group are much higher than those of the younger groups. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain strict social distancing rules to reduce infected cases.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Neurological manifestations in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective: Following the outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), there is strong evidence of neurological involvement in these patients. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. Method(s): A systematic review of studies reporting neurological manifestations published between 1 December, 2019 and 11 May, 2020 was performed. Studies were grouped based on neurological manifestation. Pooled analyses of individual patient's clinical characteristics and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction prevalence were performed. Result(s): Of 486 studies identified, 48 were included. 70 patients with 73 neurological manifestations were reported. 39 (53.4%) patients had stroke, 18 (24.7%) had Guillain-Barre syndrome and variants, 11 (15.1%) had meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, or myelitis, and five (6.8%) had seizures. They had a mean age of 61.9 +/- 17.7 years (60.6% male). Neurological disease occurred 8.1 +/- 6.8 days from initial symptoms. Average mortality rate was 17.8%. Stroke has a mortality rate of 25.6%. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction occurred in 59.9% and 57.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Stroke is the most frequently reported neurological manifestation in COVID-19 and has the highest mortality rate. Neurological manifestations tend to develop one to two weeks after the onset of respiratory disease. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 neurological manifestations.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	false
0	The Outcome of Hydroxychloroquine in Patients Treated for COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an unprecedented public health challenge worldwide. Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. Purpose(s): To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ+AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ+AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.39-1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR=1.26; 95% CI: 0.66-2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%-10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR=0.9; 95% CI: 0.36-2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR=2.35; 95% CI: 1.15-4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ+AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500ms (OR=1.11; 95% CI: 0.54-2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.52-1.63), and mortality (OR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.55-1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%-15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%-7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious. Similarly, HCQ+AZ combination was not different from HCQ alone in curbing mortality and ICU admission.Copyright © 2020 Teshale Ayele Mega et al.	false
0	The role of Chinese medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Introduction: Chinese medicine (CM) has been used to treat Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in China. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of CM in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving CM in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified from Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Database, Wanfang Database and VIP Information Database. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated with Cochrane Hanadbook criteria, and the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Result(s): A total of 7 valid studies involving 681 patients were included. The meta-analysis exhibited in comparison to conventional treatment, CM combined with conventional treatment significantly improved clinical efficacy (RR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.08,1.36]), and significantly increased viral nucleic acid negative conversion rate (RR = 1.49, 95% CI [1.13,1.97]). CM also prominently reduced pulmonary inflammation (RR = 1.27, 95% CI [1.12,1.44]), and improved host immune function (WBC, MD = 0.92, 95% CI [0.07,1.76]; LYM, MD = 0.33, 95% CI [0.08,0.57]; LYM%, MD = 2.90, 95% CI [2.09,3.71]; CRP, MD = -12.66, 95% CI [-24.40, -0.92]). Meanwhile, CM did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions (RR = 1.17, 95% CI [0.39,3.52]). Conclusion(s): According to the allocated data, CM has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety on COVID-19 pneumonia, which need to be confirmed by high quality, multiple-center, large sample randomized controlled trials.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Hydroxychloroquine and QTc prolongation in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Among many drugs that hold potential in COVID-19 pandemic, chloroquine (CQ), and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have generated unusual interest. With increasing usage, there has been growing concern about the prolongation of QTc interval and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with HCQ, especially in combination with azithromycin., AIMS: This meta-analysis is planned to study the risk of QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes (TdP) by a well-defined criterion for HCQ, CQ alone, and in combination with Azithromycin in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was made in two databases (PubMed, Embase). Three outcomes explored in the included studies were frequency of QTc > 500ms (ms) or DELTAQTc>60ms (Outcome 1), frequency of QTc>500ms (Outcome 2) and frequency of TdP (Outcome 3). Random effects method with inverse variance approach was used for computation of pooled summary and risk ratio., RESULTS: A total of 13 studies comprising of 2138 patients were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3 for HCQ, CQ alone with or without Azithromycin were 10.18% (5.59-17.82%, I2 - 92%), 10.22% (6.01-16.85%, I2 - 79%), and 0.72% (0.34-1.51, I2 - 0%) respectively. The prevalence of outcome 2 in subgroup analysis for HCQ and HCQ + Azithromycin was 7.25% (3.22-15.52, I2 - 59%) and 8.61% (4.52-15.79, I2 - 76%), respectively. The risk ratio (RR) for outcome 1 and outcome 2 between HCQ + Azithromycin and HCQ was 1.22 (0.77-1.93, I2 - 0%) & 1.51 (0.79-2.87, I2 - 13%), respectively and was not significant. Heterogeneity was noted statistically as well clinically (regimen types, patient numbers, study design, and outcome definition)., CONCLUSION: The use of HCQ/CQ is associated with a high prevalence of QTc prolongation. However, it is not associated with a high risk of TdP. Copyright © 2020 Indian Heart Rhythm Society. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 Infection and Placental Histopathology in Women Delivering at Term. BACKGROUND: - There is a paucity of data describing the effects of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients, on placental pathology. Although the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not completely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response and results in a hypercoagulable state with widespread microthrombi. We hypothesized that it is plausible that a similar disease process may occur in the fetal-maternal unit., OBJECTIVE: - The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 in term patients admitted to Labor and Delivery, including women without COVID-19 symptomatology, is associated with increased placental injury compared to a cohort of COVID-19 negative controls., STUDY DESIGN: - This was a retrospective cohort study performed at NYU Winthrop Hospital between 3/31/2020 and 6/17/2020. During the study period all women admitted to Labor and Delivery were routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of symptomatology. The placental histopathological findings of COVID-19 patients (n=77) who delivered a singleton gestation at term were compared to a control group of term patients without COVID-19 (n=56). Controls were excluded if they had obstetric or medical complications including fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy or thrombophilia. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for variables that were significant in univariable analyses. A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing asymptomatic COVID-19 cases to negative controls., RESULTS: - In univariable analyses, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion, i.e. presence of avascular villi and/or mural fibrin deposition (32.5% (25/77) vs. 3.6% (2/56), p<0.0001) and villitis of unknown etiology (20.8% (16/77) vs. 7.1% (4/56), p=0.030). These findings persisted in a subgroup analysis of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases compared to COVID-19 negative controls. In a multivariable model adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios, the frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion abnormalities remained significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (OR= 12.63, 95% CI [2.40, 66.40]). While the frequency of villitis of unknown etiology was more than double in COVID-19 cases compared to controls, this did not reach statistical significance in a similar multivariable model (OR=2.11, 95% CI [0.50, 8.97]). All neonates of mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR., CONCLUSIONS: - Despite the fact that all neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, we found that COVID-19 in term patients admitted to Labor and Delivery is associated with increased rates of placental histopathologic abnormalities, particularly fetal vascular malperfusion and villitis of unknown etiology. These findings appear to occur even among asymptomatic term patients. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Is there a role for childhood vaccination against COVID-19?. Tremendous efforts are undertaken to quickly develop COVID-19 vaccines that protect vulnerable individuals from severe disease and thereby limit the health and socioeconomical impacts of the pandemic. Potential candidates are tested in adult populations and questions arise of whether COVID-19 vaccination should be implemented in children. Compared to adults, the incidence and disease severity of COVID-19 is low in children and despite their infectiveness, their role in disease propagation is limited. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines will need to have fully demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing not only complications but transmission to justify childhood vaccination. This work summarizes currently tested vaccine platforms and debates practical and ethical considerations for their potential use in children. It also discusses the already deleterious effect of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine coverage, calling for action to limit the risks for a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases.

0	Wildfire and COVID-19 pandemic: effect of environmental pollution PM-2.5 an car on monoxide on the dynamics of daily cases and deaths due to SARS-COV-2 infection in San-Francisco USA. OBJECTIVE: The wildfire allied environmental pollution is highly toxic and can cause significant wide-ranging damage to the regional environment, weather conditions, and it can facilitate the transmission of microorganisms and diseases. The present study aims to investigate the effect of wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter (PM-2.5 mu m), and carbon monoxide (CO) on the dynamics of daily cases and deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in San Francisco, USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we selected San Francisco, one of the regions affected by the wildfires allied pollution in California, USA. The data on the COVID-19 pandemic in San Francisco, including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from Worldometer Web. The daily environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM-2.5 mu m) and carbon monoxide (CO) were recorded from the metrological web “BAAQMD”. The daily cases, deaths, particulate matter (PM-2.5 mu m) and carbon monoxide were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of (SARS-CoV-2) in San Francisco, CA, USA, from March 20, 2020 to Sept 16, 2020. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 mu m) and the number of daily cases (r=0.203, p=0.007), cumulative cases (r=0.567, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.562, p<0.001); whereas the PM2.5 pm and daily deaths had no relationship (r=-0.015, p=0.842). In addition, CO was also positively correlated with cumulative cases (r=0.423, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.315, p<0.001), however, CO had no correlation with the number of daily cases (r=0.134, p=0.075) and daily deaths (r=0.030, p=0.693). In San Francisco, one micrometer (mu g/m3) in crease in PM2.5 caused an increase in the daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths of SARS-COV-2 by 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, with a 1 part per million (ppm) increase in carbon monoxide level, the daily number of cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths increased by 5%, 9.3% and 5.3%, respectively. On the other hand, CO and daily deaths had no significant relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter PM-2.5pm and CO have a positive association with an increased number of SARS-COV-2 daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths in San Francisco. The metrological, disaster management and health officials must implement the necessary policies and assist in planning to minimize the wildfire incidences, environmental pollution and COVID-19 pandemic both at regional and international levels.	false
0	Increased Incidence of Barotrauma in Patients with COVID-19 on Invasive Mechanical Ventilation. Background: A high number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia who had barotrauma related to invasive mechanical ventilation at the authors' institution were observed Purpose: To determine if the rate of barotrauma in patients with COVID-19 infection was greater than in other patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at the authors' institution Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical and imaging data of patients seen between March 1, 2020, and April 6, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced barotrauma associated with invasive mechanical ventilation, were compared with patients without COVID-19 infection during the same period. Historical comparison was made to barotrauma rates of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from February 1, 2016, to February 1, 2020, at the authors' institution. Comparison of patient groups was performed using categoric or continuous statistical testing as appropriate, with multivariable regression analysis. Patient survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves analysis. Results: A total of 601 patients with COVID-19 infection underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (mean age, 63 years +/- 15 [standard deviation]; 71% men). Of the total, there were 89 (15%) patients with one or more barotrauma events for a total of 145 barotrauma events (24% overall events) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21%, 28%). During the same period, 196 patients without COVID-19 infection (mean age, 64 years +/- 19; 52% men) with invasive mechanical ventilation had one barotrauma event (0.5%; 95% CI: 0%, 3%; P<.001 vs the group with COVID-19 infection). Of 285 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome on invasive mechanical ventilation during the previous 4 years (mean age, 68 years +/- 17; 60% men), 28 patients (10%) had 31 barotrauma events, with an overall barotrauma rate of 11% (95% CI: 8%, 15%; P<.001 vs the group with COVID-19 infection). Barotrauma is an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 (odds ratio = 2.2; P =.03) and is associated with a longer hospital stay (odds ratio = 0.92; P<.001). Conclusion: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and invasive mechanical ventilation had a higher rate of barotrauma than patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and patients without COVID-19 infection.

0	Adapting to the Coronavirus Pandemic: Building and Incorporating a Diagnostic Pipeline in a Shared Resource Laboratory. In March 2020, with lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic underway, the Francis Crick Institute (the Crick) re-geared its research laboratories into clinical testing facilities. Two pipelines were established one for PCR and the other for Serology. This paper discusses the Cricks Flow Cytometry Science Technology Platform (Flow STP) role in setting up the Serology pipeline, pipeline here referring to the overarching processes in place to facilitate the receipt of human sera through to a SARs-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) result. We examine the challenges that had to be overcome by a research laboratory to incorporate clinical diagnostics and the processes by which this was achieved. It describes; the governance required to run the service; the design of the SOPs and pipeline; the setting up of the assay; the validation required to show the robustness of the pipeline and reporting the results of the assay. Finally, as the lockdown started to ease in June 2020 it examines how this new service affects the daily running of the Flow STP. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which is most frequently mild yet can be severe and life-threatening. Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization., METHODS: In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here., RESULTS: At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was -3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LY-CoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was -0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.98 to -0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group., CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of three doses of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11.

0	Possible association of vitamin D status with lung involvement and outcome in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective study. PURPOSE: Vitamin D deficiency has been reported as a key factor in the development of infectious diseases such as respiratory tract infections and inflammatory processes like acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the impact of vitamin D on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 is still not fully known. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of serum vitamin D concentration on the extent of lung involvement and final outcome in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: Seventy-three subjects with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were investigated in this study. The patients had been admitted to our academic hospital from February 28, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, serum 25(OH)D levels, and findings of initial chest computed tomography were recorded. Linear and binary logistic regression, cox regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 55.18 +/- 14.98 years old; 46.4% were male. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in the deceased (13.83 +/- 12.53 ng/ mL compared with discharged patients (38.41 +/- 18.51 ng/mL) (P < 0.001). Higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with significantly less extent of total lung involvement (beta = - 0.10, P = 0.004). In addition, vitamin D deficiency [25(OH) D < 25 ng/mL] was associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 4.15, P = 0.04)., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that serum vitamin D status might provide useful information regarding the clinical course, extent of lung involvement and outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.	false
0	Stratification of Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19. Despite myriad improvements in the care of COVID-19 patients, atypical manifestations are least appreciated during the current pandemic. Because COVID-19 is primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, the possibility of viral invasions into the other organs cannot be disregarded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with various viral infections including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and HIV. The prevalence and risks of AKI during the course of COVID-19 have been described in few studies. However, the existing literature demonstrate great disparity across findings amid variations in methodology and population. This article underscores the propensity of AKI among COVID-19 patients, limitations of the exiting evidence, and importance of timely identification during the case management. The prevalence of AKI is variable across the studies ranging from 4.7% to 81%. Evidence suggest old age, comorbidities, ventilator support, use of vasopressors, black race, severe infection, and elevated levels of baseline serum creatinine and d-dimers are independent risk factors of COVID-19 associated with AKI. COVID-19 patients with AKI also showed unsatisfactory renal recovery and higher mortality rate as compared with patients without AKI. These findings underscore that AKI frequently occurs during the course of COVID-19 infection and requires early stratification and management.	false
0	Vitamin D deficiency aggravates COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis. There is still limited evidence regarding the influence of vitamin D in people with COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyze the association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity, via an analysis of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in people with the disease. Five online databases-Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and pre-print Medrevix were searched. The inclusion criteria were observational studies measuring serum vitamin D in adult and elderly subjects with COVID-19. The main outcome was the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in severe cases of COVID-19. We carried out a meta-analysis with random effect measures. We identified 1542 articles and selected 27. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with a higher chance of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.80-1.88), but we identified that severe cases of COVID-19 present 64% (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.30-2.09) more vitamin D deficiency compared with mild cases. A vitamin D concentration insufficiency increased hospitalization (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.41-2.21) and mortality from COVID-19 (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.06-2.58). We observed a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of the disease.	false
0	Dynamics of NK, CD8 and Tfh cell mediated the production of cytokines and antiviral antibodies in Chinese patients with moderate COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated a marked decrease in peripheral lymphocyte levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Few studies have focused on the changes of NK, T- and B-cell subsets, inflammatory cytokines and virus-specific antibodies in patients with moderate COVID-19. A total of 11 RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent patients with COVID-19 and 11 patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (control patients) were enrolled in this study. NK, CD8(+) T, CD4(+) T, Tfh-like and B-cell subsets were analysed using flow cytometry. Cytokines and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were analysed using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. NK cell counts were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 than in control patients (P = 0.017). Effector memory CD8(+) T-cell counts significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 during a convalescent period of 1 week (P = 0.041). TIM-3(+) Tfh-like cell and CD226(+) Tfh-like cell counts significantly increased (P = 0.027) and decreased (P = 0.022), respectively, during the same period. Moreover, ICOS+ Tfh-like cell counts tended to decrease (P = 0.074). No abnormal increase in cytokine levels was observed. The high expression of NK cells is important in innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The increase in effector memory CD8(+) T-cell counts, the up-regulation of inhibitory molecules and the down-regulation of active molecules on CD4(+) T cells and Tfh-like cells in patients with COVID-19 would benefit the maintenance of balanced cellular and humoural immune responses, may prevent the development of severe cases and contribute to the recovery of patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Does having a high-risk pregnancy influence anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic?. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the changing level of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women, with and without high-risk indicators separately, in a tertiary care center serving also for COVID-19 patients, in the capital of Turkey., STUDY DESIGN: We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited., RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p < 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

0	Retrospective Post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of Autopsies with COVID-19-Suggestive Pathology Supports the Absence of Lethal Community Spread in Basel, Switzerland, before February 2020. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world. While the first case was recorded in Hubei in December 2019, the extent of early community spread in Central Europe before this period is unknown. A high proportion of asymptomatic cases and undocumented infections, high transmissibility, and phylogenetic genomic diversity have engendered the controversial possibility of early international community spread of SARS-CoV-2 before its emergence in China., METHODS: To assess the early presence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland, we retrospectively performed an analysis of deaths at University Hospital Basel between October 2019 and February 2020 (n = 310), comparing the incidence of clinical causes of death with March 2020 (n = 72), the month during which the first lethal COVID-19 cases in Basel were reported. Trends of COVID-19-suggestive sequelae, such as bronchopneumonia with organization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolisms (PE) were evaluated. In cases where autopsy was performed (n = 71), analogous analyses were conducted on the cause of death and pulmonary histological findings. Eight cases with a COVID-19-suggestive clinical history and histopathology between October 2019 and February 2020, and 3 cases before October 2019, were selected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR., RESULTS: A statistically significant rise in pulmonary causes of death was observed in March 2020 (p = 0.03), consistent with the reported emergence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland. A rise in lethal bronchopneumonia was observed between December 2019 and January 2020, which was likely seasonal. The incidence of lethal ARDS and PE was uniformly low between October 2019 and February 2020. All autopsy cases analyzed by means of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR yielded negative results., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the absence of early lethal community spread of COVID-19 in Basel before its initial reported emergence in Switzerland in March 2020.

0	Gastrointestinal manifestations and dynamics of liver enzymes in children and adolescents with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Objectives: To improve the knowledge on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) infection, we aimed to study the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the dynamics of liver enzymes in children infected with COVID-19. Method(s): We performed a systematic search of all the articles published up to May 2020 in the following databases: PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane. We chose the fixed-or random-effect model for analysis based on the I2 statistic. The included data were analyzed to identify the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting or nausea) and to identify the dynamics of liver enzymes in children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19. Result(s): We detected an overall prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms of 26% (95% CI: 0.18-0.35). The pooled prevalence of diarrhea and nausea/vomiting was 12% (95% CI: 0.08-0.16) with no heterogeneity (P = 0.19; I2 = 23.53%) and 11% (95% CI: 0.05-0.17), respectively. The pooled prevalence of elevated ALT and AST and LDH was 12% (95% CI: 0.07-0.17), 14% (95% CI: 0.10-0.18) and 33% (95% CI: 0.12-0.54), respectively among the included studies. Conclusion(s): According to our systematic review and meta-analysis, 26% of the children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19 present gastrointestinal symptoms. This paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of digestive symptoms of COVID-19 and of the liver enzymes dynamics in children and adolescents.Copyright © 2020, Author(s).	false
0	Stroke and Novel Coronavirus Infection in Humans: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background: As the world witnessed the devastation caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a growing body of literature on COVID-19 is also becoming increasingly available. Stroke has increasingly been reported as a complication of COVID-19 infection. However, a systematic synthesis of the available data has not been conducted. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data related to both stroke and COVID-19 infection. Method(s): We systematically searched Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed for studies related to stroke and COVID-19 from inception up to June 4, 2020. We selected cohort studies, case series, and case reports that reported the occurrence of stroke in COVID-19 patients. A fixed-effects model was used to estimate the pooled frequency of stroke in COVID-19 patients with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Result(s): Twenty-eight studies were included in the systematic review and seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled frequency of stroke in COVID-19 patients was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.8, 1.3). The heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0.0%). Even though the frequency of stroke among patients having COVID-19 infection was low, those with concomitant COVID-19 infection and stroke suffered from a more severe infection and eventually had a poorer prognosis with a higher mortality rate (46.7%) than COVID-19 alone. Many COVID-19 patients shared the common traditional risk factors for stroke. We noted that ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation with large vessels occlusion is the most common type of stroke with more strokes seen in multi-territorial regions, suggesting systemic thromboembolism. An elevated level of D-dimers, C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, troponin, ESR, fibrinogen, and a positive antiphospholipid antibody were also noted in this review. Conclusion(s): The occurrence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection is uncommon, but it may pose as an important prognostic marker and indicator of severity of infection, by causing large vessels occlusion and exhibiting a thrombo-inflammatory vascular picture. Physicians should be made aware and remain vigilant on the possible two-way relationship between stroke and COVID-19 infection. The rate of stroke among patients with COVID-19 infection may increase in the future as they share the common risk factors.© Copyright © 2020 Lee, Yusof Khan, Ching, Chia, Loh, Abdul Rashid, Baharin, Inche Mat, Wan Sulaiman, Devaraj, Sivaratnam, Basri and Hoo.	false
0	Prevalence and impact of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 in China. BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has spread rapidly around the world. Previous studies have indicated that COVID-19 patients with diabetes are prone to having poor clinical outcomes. AIM To systematically evaluate the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients in China and its impact on clinical outcomes, including ICU admission, progression to severe cases, or death. METHODS We searched studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE from December 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 to identify relevant observational study that investigated the prevalence of diabetes among COVID-19 patients or its impact on clinical outcomes. We used a random-effects or fixed-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetes and risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of diabetes on outcomes. Funnel plots were used to evaluate the publication bias and the heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic. RESULTS Twenty-three eligible articles including 49564 COVID-19 patients (1573 with and 47991 without diabetes) were finally included. The pooled prevalence of diabetes was 10% (95%CI: 7%-15%) in COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup analyses, the pooled prevalence of diabetes was higher in studies with patients aged > 50 years (13%; 95%CI: 11%-16%) than in studies with patients aged <= 50 years (7%; 95%CI: 6%-8%), in severe patients (17%; 95%CI: 14%-20%) than in non-severe patients (6%; 95%CI: 5%-8%), and in dead patients (30%; 95%CI: 13%-46%) than in survivors (8%; 95%CI: 2%-15%) (P < 0.05 for all). Compared with patients without diabetes, the risk of severe cases was higher (RR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.76-2.56, I2 = 49%) in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The risk of death was also higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes (RR = 3.16, 95%CI: 2.64-3.78, I2 = 34%). However, diabetes was not found to be significantly associated with admission to ICU (RR = 1.16, 95%CI: 0.15-9.11). CONCLUSION Nearly one in ten COVID-19 patients have diabetes in China. Diabetes is associated with a higher risk of severe illness and death. The present study suggested that targeted early intervention is needed in COVID-19 patients with diabetes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

0	Micro-fusion inhibition tests: quantifying antibody neutralization of virus-mediated cell-cell fusion. Although enveloped viruses canonically mediate particle entry through virus-cell fusion, certain viruses can spread by cell-cell fusion, brought about by receptor engagement and triggering of membrane-bound, viral-encoded fusion proteins on the surface of cells. The formation of pathogenic syncytia or multinucleated cells is seen in vivo, but their contribution to viral pathogenesis is poorly understood. For the negative-strand paramyxoviruses respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Nipah virus (NiV), cell-cell spread is highly efficient because their oligomeric fusion protein complexes are active at neutral pH. The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also been reported to induce syncytia formation in infected cells, with the spike protein initiating cell-cell fusion. Whilst it is well established that fusion protein-specific antibodies can block particle attachment and/or entry into the cell (canonical virus neutralization), their capacity to inhibit cell-cell fusion and the consequences of this neutralization for the control of infection are not well characterized, in part because of the lack of specific tools to assay and quantify this activity. Using an adapted bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, based on a split GFP-Renilla luciferase reporter, we have established a micro-fusion inhibition test (mFIT) that allows the identification and quantification of these neutralizing antibodies. This assay has been optimized for high-throughput use and its applicability has been demonstrated by screening monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated inhibition of RSV and NiV fusion and, separately, the development of fusion-inhibitory antibodies following NiV vaccine immunization in pigs. In light of the recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a similar assay was developed for SARS-CoV-2 and used to screen mAbs and convalescent patient plasma for fusion-inhibitory antibodies. Using mFITs to assess antibody responses following natural infection or vaccination is favourable, as this assay can be performed entirely at low biocontainment, without the need for live virus. In addition, the repertoire of antibodies that inhibit cell-cell fusion may be different to those that inhibit particle entry, shedding light on the mechanisms underpinning antibody-mediated neutralization of viral spread.	false

0	Adverse Events in Italian Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Epidemic: A National Survey. Older people living in nursing homes (NHs) are particularly vulnerable in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, due to the high prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities (e.g., dementia). The phenomenon of adverse events (AEs), intended as any harm or injury resulting from medical care or to the failure to provide care, has not yet been investigated in NHs during the pandemic. We performed a national survey on 3,292 NHs, either public or providing services both privately and within the national health system, out of the 3,417 NHs covering the whole Italian territory. An online questionnaire was addressed to the directors of each facility between March 24 and April 27, 2020. The list of NHs was provided by the Dementia Observatory, an online map of Italian services for people with dementia, which was one of the objectives of the implementation of the Italian National Dementia Plan. About 26% of residents in the Italian NHs for older people listed within the Dementia Observatory site had dementia. The objective of our study was to report the frequency of AEs that occurred during the months when SARS-CoV-2 spreading rate was at its highest in the Italian NHs and to identify which conditions and attributes were most associated with the occurrence of AEs by means of multivariate regression logistic analysis. Data are referred to 1,356 NHs that participated in the survey. The overall response rate was 41.2% over a time-period of six weeks (from March 24 to May 5). About one third of the facilities (444 out of 1,334) (33.3%) reported at least 1 adverse event, with a total of 2,000 events. Among the included NHs, having a bed capacity higher than the median of 60 beds (OR=1.57, CI95% 1.17-2.09; p=0.002), an observed increased in the use of psychiatric drugs (OR=1.80, CI95% 1.05-3.07; p=0.032), adopting physical restraint measures (OR=1.97, CI95% 1.47-2.64; p<0.001), residents hospitalized due to flu-like symptoms (OR =1.73, CI95% 1.28-2.32; p<0.001), and being located in specific geographic areas (OR=3.59, CI95% 1.81-7.08; OR = 2.90, CI95% 1.45-5.81 and OR = 4.02, CI05% 2.01-8.04 for, respectively, North-West, North-East and Centre vs South, p<0.001) were all factors positively associated to the occurrence of adverse events in the facility. Future recommendations for the management and care of residents in NHs during the COVID-19 pandemic should include specific statements for the most vulnerable populations, such as people with dementia.© Copyright © 2020 Lombardo, Salvi, Lacorte, Piscopo, Mayer, Ancidoni, Remoli, Bellomo, Losito, D'Ancona, Canevelli, Onder, Vanacore and The Italian National Institute of Health Nursing Home Study Group.	false
0	Unplanned and medical admissions to pediatric intensive care units significantly decreased during COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy. Northern Italy has been the first European area affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictive measures. We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PICU admissions in Northern Italy, using data from the Italian Network of Pediatric Intensive Care Units Registry. We included all patients admitted to 4 PICUs from 8-weeks-before to 8-weeks-after February 24th, 2020, and those admitted in the same period in 2019. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) evaluating incidence rate differences between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods in 2020 (IRR-1), as well as between the post-COVID-19-period with the same period in 2019 (IRR-2), were computed using zero-inflated negative binomial or Poisson regression modeling. A total of 1001 admissions were included. The number of PICU admissions significantly decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and compared to the same period in 2020 (IRR-1 0.63 [95%CI 0.50-0.79]; IRR-2 0.70 [CI 0.57-0.91]). Unplanned and medical admissions significantly decreased (IRR-1 0.60 [CI 0.46-0.70]; IRR-2 0.67 [CI 0.51-0.89]; and IRR-1 0.52, [CI 0.40-0.67]; IRR-2 0.77 [CI 0.58-1.00], respectively). Intra-hospital, planned (potentially delayed by at least 12 h), and surgical admissions did not significantly change. Patients admitted for respiratory failure significantly decreased (IRR-1 0.55 [CI 0.37-0.77]; IRR-2 0.48 [CI 0.33-0.69]). Conclusion(s): Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly decreased during COVID-19 outbreak, especially those for respiratory failure.What is Known:* Northern Italy has been the first European area affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.* Although children are relatively spared from the severe COVID-19 disease, the pediatric care system has been affected by social restrictive measures, with a reported 73-88% reduction in pediatric emergency department admissions.What is New:* Unplanned and medical PICU admissions significantly decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to pre-COVID-19 and to the same period in 2019, especially those for respiratory failure. Further studies are needed to identify associated factors and new prevention strategies.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Preoperative COVID-19 testing for elective vitreoretinal surgeries: Experience from a major tertiary care institute in South India. Purpose: To study the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) among patients undergoing elective vitreoretinal surgeries at a tertiary care eye hospital., Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study was performed between July 16, 2020 and August 31, 2020, in the retina clinic of a tertiary care eye hospital in south India. All patients undergoing elective retinal surgical procedures underwent RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 before being posted for surgery and after obtaining informed consent. Patients planned for surgery under general anesthesia underwent additional computed tomography of the chest. Testing strategies and outcomes were documented., Results: Out of a total of 413 patients who were given appointments for surgery during this period, nine patients (2.2%) were found to have positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and their surgeries were postponed. The test positivity (prevalence) rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection among all elective vitreoretinal surgical patients in our hospital was 2.2%. None of the patients were symptomatic for COVID-19., Conclusion: Our results showed that among patients visiting high volume ophthalmic centers in the near future, approximately 1 in 45 patients may be asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may lead to chances of transmission of the virus inside healthcare facilities among other visiting patients and healthcare workers.	false
0	The Role of COVID-19 in the Death of SARS-CoV-2-Positive Patients: A Study Based on Death Certificates. Background: Death certificates are considered the most reliable source of information to compare cause-specific mortality across countries. The aim of the present study was to examine death certificates of persons who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to (a) quantify the number of deaths directly caused by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); (b) estimate the most common complications leading to death; and (c) identify the most common comorbidities. Methods: Death certificates of persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 provided to the National Surveillance system were coded according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Deaths due to COVID-19 were defined as those in which COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Complications were defined as those conditions reported as originating from COVID-19, and comorbidities were conditions independent of COVID-19. Results: A total of 5311 death certificates of persons dying in March through May 2020 were analysed (16.7% of total deaths). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 88% of cases. Pneumonia and respiratory failure were the most common complications, being identified in 78% and 54% of certificates, respectively. Other complications, including shock, respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema, and heart complications demonstrated a low prevalence, but they were more commonly observed in the 30-59 years age group. Comorbidities were reported in 72% of certificates, with little variation by age and gender. The most common comorbidities were hypertensive heart disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, and neoplasms. Neoplasms and obesity were the main comorbidities among younger people. Discussion: In most persons dying after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 was the cause directly leading to death. In a large proportion of death certificates, no comorbidities were reported, suggesting that this condition can be fatal in healthy persons. Respiratory complications were common, but non-respiratory complications were also observed.	false
0	Associations of sedentary behaviors and incidence of unhealthy diet during the COVID-19 quarantine in Brazil. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the association of change patterns on TV-viewing and computer/tablet use and incidence of elevated consumption of ultra-processed food consumption and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: Data of 39,208 Brazilian adults from the Behavior Web Survey were used. Unhealthy nutrition habits were eating fruits or vegetables (< 5 day/week) and ultra-processed food (sugary foods, snacks, ready-to-eat frozen foods and embedded foods) (>=5 days/week). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the unhealthy behavior before the quarantine. We created four categories of change in TV-viewing and computer/tablet use, considering a cut-off point of 4h/d for each behavior (1-consistently low, 2-become low during the quarantine, 3-become high during the quarantine or 4-consistently high). Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, per capita income, working status during the quarantine, skin color and adherence to the quarantine., SETTING: Brazil., PARTICIPANTS: Brazilian adults (nationally representative)., RESULTS: Logistic regression models revealed that high TV-viewing and computer/tablet use incidence were associated with higher odds for elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption (TV-viewing: OR: 1.70; 95%CI: 1.37 to 2.12; computer/tablet: 1.73; 1.31 to 2.27) and low consumption of fruit and vegetables (TV-viewing: 1.70; 1.29 to 2.23; computer/tablet: 1.53; 1.08 to 2.17) incidence. Consistent high computer/tablet use also presented higher odds for incidence of elevated frequency of ultra-processed food consumption., CONCLUSIONS: Participants with incidence of sedentary behaviors were more likely to also present incidence of unhealthy diet during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 presence in the saliva, tears and cerumen of COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: The emergence of a new coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 from China led to a global pandemic. The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: The study included 38 COVID-19 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples. Saliva, tear and cerumen samples were taken from the patients within 72 hours of the first RT-PCR test. SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 gene regions were studied with single-step RT-PCR in all samples., RESULTS: Among the studied samples, the highest positivity rate was in saliva (76.3%) followed by tears (55.3%) and cerumen (39.5%). Viral load in saliva was also significantly higher compared to tears and cerumen (p<0.001), while there was no significant difference between tears and cerumen. Higher viral load in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples was associated with higher viral load in tears, but not in saliva or cerumen. Half of the saliva, tear and cerumen samples obtained from asymptomatic patients contained SARS-CoV-2 genome., CONCLUSION: The virus was detected in the saliva, tears and cerumen samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The potential role of these bodily fluids on viral spread needs to be studied. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Radiological Thoracic Vertebral Fractures are Highly Prevalent in COVID-19 and Predict Disease Outcomes. CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has become the most relevant medical issue globally. Despite several studies that have investigated clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, no data have been reported on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs). Since VFs may influence cardiorespiratory function and disease outcomes, the aim of this study was to assess VFs prevalence and clinical impact in COVID-19., DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at San Raffaele Hospital, a tertiary health care hospital in Italy. We included COVID-19 patients for whom lateral chest x-rays at emergency department were available. VFs were detected using a semiquantitative evaluation of vertebral shape on chest x-rays., RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in this study and thoracic VFs were detected in 41 patients (36%). Patients with VFs were older and more frequently affected by hypertension and coronary artery disease (P < 0.001, P = 0.007, P = 0.034; respectively). Thirty-six (88%) patients in VFs+ group compared to 54 (74%) in VFs- group were hospitalized (P = 0.08). Patients with VFs more frequently required noninvasive mechanical ventilation compared with those without VFs (P = 0.02). Mortality was 22% in VFs+ group and 10% in VFs- group (P = 0.07). In particular, mortality was higher in patients with severe VFs compared with those with moderate and mild VFs (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: VFs may integrate the cardiorespiratory risk of COVID-19 patients, being a useful and easy to measure clinical marker of fragility and poor prognosis. We suggest that morphometric thoracic vertebral evaluation should be performed in all suspected COVID-19 patients undergoing chest x-rays. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	"""Trained immunity"" from Mycobacterium spp. exposure or BCG vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes. Protective variables for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unknown. ""Trained immunity"" of the populace as a result of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of ""trained immunity"" or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 epidemiological data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity-a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations-is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. We seek to draw attention toward the inclusion of controls for underlying ""trained immunity"" and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be preexisting or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning potential benefit from them."	false
0	Echocardiographic abnormalities and predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: the ECHOVID-19 study. Aims: The present study had two aims: (i) compare echocardiographic parameters in COVID-19 patients with matched controls and (2) assess the prognostic value of measures of left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in relation to COVID-19 related death. Methods and Results: In this prospective multicentre cohort study, 214 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent an echocardiographic examination (by pre-determined research protocol). All participants were successfully matched 1:1 with controls from the general population on age, sex, and hypertension. Mean age of the study sample was 69 years, and 55% were male participants. LV and RV systolic function was significantly reduced in COVID-19 cases as assessed by global longitudinal strain (GLS) (16.4% +/- 4.3 vs. 18.5% +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (2.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001), and RV strain (19.8 +/- 5.9 vs. 24.2 +/- 6.5, P = 0.004). All parameters remained significantly reduced after adjusting for important cardiac risk factors. During follow-up (median: 40 days), 25 COVID-19 cases died. In multivariable Cox regression reduced TAPSE [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.07-1.31], P = 0.002, per 1 mm decrease], RV strain (HR = 1.64, 95%CI[1.02;2.66], P = 0.043, per 1% decrease) and GLS (HR = 1.20, 95%CI[1.07-1.35], P = 0.002, per 1% decrease) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death. TAPSE and GLS remained significantly associated with the outcome after restricting the analysis to patients without prevalent heart disease. Conclusion(s): RV and LV function are significantly impaired in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with matched controls. Furthermore, reduced TAPSE and GLS are independently associated with COVID-19-related death.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and parainfluenza virus in a hemodialysis patient: A case report. Background: In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and now has spread to many countries. Limited data are available for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Case presentation: We report a 66-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and parainfluenza virus infection in Wuhan. We describe the clinical characteristics, radiological findings, and treatment of the hemodialysis patient, including the patient's initial pneumonia at presentation with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Discussion and conclusion: Our case underscores the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with other pathogens in hemodialysis patients and the importance of early identification of COVID- 19.Copyright © 2020 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.

In the original publication, one of the last paragraphs should have read as follows: A recent observation is that the prevalence of people who currently smoke cigarettes admitted for COVID-19 was low compared with the prevalence of smoking in the local general population. In China, of those hospitalized with Covid-19 only 6% were current smokers, whereas 27% of the general population of China smokes. (Farsalinos et al. 2020). In France, the smoker rate was 5% of COVID-19 admissions compared with a 25% smoker rate for the general French population. (Polosa and Caci 2020).

0	Risk factors for symptoms of infection and microbial carriage among French medical students abroad. Objectives: To investigate symptoms of infections and their risk factors among French medical students undertaking an internship abroad. Method(s): Clinical follow up, and qPCR-based respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vaginal pathogen carriages were prospectively assessed pre-travel and post-travel, in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France. Result(s): 293 students were included. 63.5%, 35.8%, and 3.6% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Enteropathogenic E. coli was 40.9% and 18.6%, respectively. A significant increase was observed for rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by comparing the prevalence of pathogens in pre-travel and post-travel samples. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 12.9% and 13.9%, respectively. Being female, primarily traveling to Vietnam, and living in basic accommodation conditions were independent risk factors for reporting respiratory symptoms. Students reporting respiratory symptoms were three times more likely to acquire S. pneumoniae. Traveling primarily to north India and Senegal were independent risk factors for diarrhea. Conclusion(s): This study makes it possible to identify the leading infectious diseases linked to travel in a group of French medical students undertaking an internship abroad and the risk factors on which to base targeting students for reinforced pre-travel advice.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	COVID-19: Literature review and its impact on the peruvian health reality. Introduction: The disease called COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2). In Peru, patient zero or first case with COVID-19 was detected on March 6th and since then the virus has continued to spread. The national government fights against this disease on several fronts, but the health situation differs greatly from developed countries. Objective(s): To review the current state of the disease and analyze its possible impact on the Peruvian health system. Method(s): A bibliographic search of various studies was carried out since the appearance of the disease (December 2019) in different databases (PUBMED, MEDLINE, PLOs, SciELO) and Google Scholar. Result(s): The virus is transmitted mainly by the respiratory route; the average incubation period is 14 days; most patients have mild disease or are asymptomatic but 5% of these will require hospitalization, some will even require intensive therapy with mechanical ventilation; the current treatment is basically symptomatic, though antibiotics, antivirals and antiparasitics have also been used. Conclusion(s): The quarantine with strict measures of isolation and social distancing is accurate given the Peruvian health reality and the imminent contagion of the population.Copyright © 2020 Universidad Ricardo Palma, Facultad de Medicina Humana.

0	A Prognostic Model to Predict Recovery of COVID-19 Patients Based on Longitudinal Laboratory Findings. The temporal change patterns of laboratory data may provide insightful clues into the whole course of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal change patterns of key laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and identify independent prognostic factors by examining the associations between laboratory findings and outcomes of patients. This multicenter study included 56 patients with COVID-19 treated in Jilin Province, China, from January 21, 2020 to March 5, 2020. The laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. The average value of eosinophils and carbon dioxide combining power continued to significantly increase, while the average value of cardiac troponin I and mean platelet volume decreased throughout the course of the disease. The average value of lymphocytes approached the lower limit of the reference interval for the first 5 days and then rose slowly thereafter. The average value of thrombocytocrit peaked on day 7 and slowly declined thereafter. The average value of mean corpuscular volume and serum sodium showed an upward trend from day 8 and day 15, respectively. Age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count and globulin level were included in the final model to predict the probability of recovery. The above parameters were verified in 24 patients with COVID-19 in another area of Jilin Province. The risk stratification and management of patients with COVID-19 could be improved according to the temporal trajectories of laboratory tests.	false

0	The single-cell landscape of immunological responses of CD4+ T cells in HIV versus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CD4 T cell loss is the hallmark of uncontrolled HIV-1 infection. Strikingly, CD4 T cell depletion is a strong indicator for disease severity in the recently emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We reviewed recent single-cell immune profiling studies in HIV-1 infection and COVID-19 to provide critical insight in virus-induced immunopathogenesis., RECENT FINDINGS: Cytokine dysregulation in HIV-1 leads to chronic inflammation, while severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cytokine release syndrome and increased mortality. HIV-1-specific CD4 T cells are dysfunctional, while SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells exhibit robust Th1 function and correlate with protective antibody responses. In HIV-1 infection, follicular helper T cells (TFH) are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and persist in immune-sanctuary sites in lymphoid tissues as an HIV-1 reservoir. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, TFH are absent in lymphoid tissues and are associated with diminished protective immunity. Advancement in HIV-1 DNA, RNA, and protein-based single-cell capture methods can overcome the rarity and heterogeneity of HIV-1-infected cells and identify mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and clonal expansion dynamics., SUMMARY: Single-cell immune profiling identifies a high-resolution picture of immune dysregulation in HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection and informs outcome prediction and therapeutic interventions.	false
0	Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Indian nationals evacuated from Iran. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian nationals evacuated from Iran were quarantined at Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. We wished to study the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this closed population., METHODS: Basic SEIR compartmental model was developed using daily stepwise approach in Microsoft Excel. Advanced model using standard differential equations in Python software version 3.6 was used to estimate R0 based on model fit to actual data., RESULTS: Forty-eight SARS-CoV-2 infections were found among the 474 quarantined individuals. Out of them, 44 (92%) were asymptomatic. R0 for the overall duration was found to be 2.29 (95% CI 1.84 - 2.78). Male gender and age >= 60 years were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 4.33, 95% CI 2.07 - 9.05 and 5.32, 95% CI 3.13 - 9.04, respectively). Isolation of infected individuals and stricter quarantine of remaining individuals reduced the R0 from 2.41 initially to 1.17 subsequently., CONCLUSION: R0 value was found comparable to the earlier studies indicating similar transmission dynamics among quarantined individuals in India. Universal testing and prompt isolation of infected individuals reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Smaller group sizes should be preferred to large groups during facility-based quarantine in evacuation situations. Role of asymptomatic individuals appears to be strong in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within closed populations.	false
0	Predictive Factors for Impaired Mental Health among Medical Students during the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Morocco. The COVID-19 pandemic has great consequences on mental health. We aimed to assess medical students' psychological condition and influencing factors as a baseline evidence for interventions promoting their mental wellbeing. We conducted an online survey from April 8 to April 18, 2020 to examine the mental health of medical students by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, seven-item Insomnia Severity Index, and six-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Five hundred forty-nine students completed the survey; 341 (62.3%), 410 (74.6%), 344 (62.6%), and 379 (69%) reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Female students, living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations, more than 25 days confinement, psychiatric consult history, and being in a preclinical level of studies had higher median scores and severe symptom levels. Multivariable logistic regression showed female gender as a risk factor for severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.653; 95% CI: 1.020-2.679; P = 0.042), depression (OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.435-3.271; P < 0.001), insomnia (OR: 1.830; 95% CI: 1.176-2.847; P = 0.007), and distress (OR: 1.994; 95% CI: 1.338-2.972; P = 0.001); preclinical level of enrollment as a risk factor for depression (OR: 0.679; 95% CI: 0.521-0.885; P = 0.004), insomnia (OR: 0.720; 95% CI: 0.545-0.949; P = 0.02), and distress (OR: 0.650; 95% CI: 0.499-0.847; P = 0.001), whereas living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations was a risk factor for severe anxiety (OR: 1.628; 95% CI: 1.090-2.432; P = 0.017) and depression (OR: 1.438; 95% CI: 1.002-2.097; P = 0.05). Currently, medical students experience high levels of mental health symptoms, especially female students, those at a preclinical level and living in regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Screening for mental health issues, psychological support, and long-term follow-up could alleviate the burden and protect future physicians.	false
0	Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. The newly emerged betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019 with more than 35 million laboratory confirmed human infections and over one million deaths within nine months. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve during the global transmission with the notable emergence of the spike D614G substitution that enhances infectivity. Some of these viral adaptations may alter not only the infectivity but also viral pathogenesis. Continuous phylogenomic analysis of circulating viral strains and functional investigation of new non-synonymous substitutions may help to understand the evolution of virus, its virulence and transmissibility. Here we describe a loss of an accessory protein orf3b (57 amino acids) in current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, contributing around 24% of more than 100,000 complete viral genomes analyzed. The loss of 3b is caused by the presence of an early stop codon which is created by an orf3a Q57H substitution. There is an increasing trend in the loss of orf3b which has reached 32% in May 2020. Geographically, loss of 3b is more prevalent in certain countries including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%). Interestingly, the loss of 3b coincides with the emergence of spike D614G substitution. In addition, we found that truncated orf3b has lost the interferon antagonism compared to the full-length orf3b, suggesting a loss of function by the newly adapted virus. Further investigation of orf3b deletion and spike D614G substitution on virulence and infectivity respectively will provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution.	false
0	Clinical Outcomes among Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients in an Isolation Facility in Chennai, India. Globally, India has reported the third highest number of COVID-19 cases. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, witnessed a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting in the establishment of isolation facilities named COVID Care Center (CCC). In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients. Older symptomatic patients with comorbidities and a high NLR admitted in an isolation facility must be frequently monitored for prompt identification of clinical progression and referral to higher center for advanced medical care.	false
0	Exploration and correlation analysis of changes in Krebs von den Lungen-6 levels in COVID-19 patients with different types in China. This study aimed to determine the clinical significance of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) in patients with COVID-19, so as to find a marker with high sensitivity, specificity and easy detection to evaluate the lung injury and inflammation of COVID-19. Sixty-three COVID-19 patients and 43 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical phenotypes and/or imaging findings were enrolled to test the levels of KL-6 using chemiluminescent immunoassay. In addition, the blood gas, imaging and lymphocyte factors tests were collected from all participants. The data was finally analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). Moreover, the KL-6 levels in severe and critically severe patients were significantly upregulated compared with patients with mild and common type (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the imaging evaluation showed a significant correlation between KL-6 and pulmonary lesion area (P < 0.05). KL-6 was also found to be significantly correlated with oxygenation index and oxygen partial pressure difference of alveolar artery (PA-aDO2) (Both P < 0.01). In conclusion, KL-6 could be an indicator to evaluate the progression of COVID-19, which is parallel to the level of lung injury and inflammation in patients. Moreover, it can also reflect the pulmonary ventilation function.	false

0	Impact of COVID-19 in Minas Gerais, Brazil: Excess Deaths, Sub-Notified Cases, Geographic and Ethnic Distribution. By analysing the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, we showed the importance of considering the sub-notification not only of deaths but also of infected cases. It was shown that the largely used criteria of a historical all-deaths baseline is not approachable in this case, where most of the deaths are associated with causes that should decrease due to social distancing and reduction of economic activities. A quite simple and intuitive model based on the Gompertz function was applied to estimate excess deaths and excess of infected cases. It fits well the data and predicts the evolution of the epidemic adequately. Based on these analyses, an excess of 21.638 deaths and 557.216 infected cases is predicted until the end of 2020, with an upper bound of the case fatality rate of around 2.4 % and a prevalence of 2.6 %. The geographical distribution of cases and deaths and its ethnic correlation are also presented. This study points out the necessity of governmental and private organizations working together to improve public awareness and stimulate social distancing to curb the viral infection, especially in critical places with high poverty.

0	Working in the Times of COVID-19. Psychological Impact of the Pandemic in Frontline Workers in Spain. This study evaluates the psychological impact (PI) of the COVID-19 pandemic in frontline workers in Spain. Participants were 546 workers (296 healthcare workers, 105 media professionals, 89 grocery workers, and 83 protective service workers). They all completed online questionnaires assessing PI, sadness, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and demographic and work-related variables. All groups but protective services workers showed higher PI levels than the general population. Healthcare and grocery workers were the most affected, with 73.6% and 65.2% of the participants, respectively, showing a severe PI. Women showed a higher PI level. Healthcare workers in the regions with higher COVID-19 incidences reported greater PI levels. The main concerns were being infected by COVID-19 or infecting others. Levels of concern correlated with higher PI levels. The protection equipment was generally reported as insufficient, which correlated with higher PI levels. Professionals reporting to overwork during the crisis (60% mass-media, 38% of healthcare and grocery and 21.7% of protective service) showed higher PI levels. In the healthcare group, taking care of patients with COVID-19 (77%) or of dying patients with COVID-19 (43.9%) was associated with higher PI levels. The perceived social recognition of their work was inversely related to PI. Most of the sample had not received psychological support. We suggest some organizational measures for frontline institutions, such as the periodical monitoring or inclusion of psychologists specialized in crisis-management to prevent negative symptoms and provide timely support.	false
0	Convalescent plasma for COVID-19: male gender, older age and hospitalisation associated with high neutralising antibody levels, England, 22 April to 12 May 2020. We analysed factors associated with neutralising antibody levels in 330 convalescent plasma donors. Women and younger donors were more likely not to have measurable neutralising antibodies, while higher antibody levels were observed in men, in older donors and in those who had been hospitalised. These data will be of value in the timely recruitment of convalescent plasma donors most likely to have high levels of neutralising antibodies for ongoing studies investigating its effectiveness.	false
0	Social determinants of health and COVID-19 infection in Brazil: an analysis of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of socioeconomic, demographic, epidemiological factors, and the health system structure in the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil., METHODS: Ecological study with variables extracted from databases, having the incidence and mortality by COVID-19 until August 23, 2020, in Brazilian states, as response variables. The magnitude of the associations was estimated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis., RESULTS: In the Brazilian states, 59.8% of variation in the incidence of COVID-19 was justified by income inequality, significant home densification, and higher mortality. In the case of mortality, those same variables explained 57.9% of the country's variations in federal units., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that socioeconomic factors influenced the evolution and impact of COVID-19 in Brazil. Thus, we suggest comprehensive actions to ensure economic conditions and strengthening of health networks for populations with socioeconomic vulnerability.	false
0	Implementation of a Pooled Surveillance Testing Program for Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections on a College Campus - Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, August 2-October 11, 2020. On university campuses and in similar congregate environments, surveillance testing of asymptomatic persons is a critical strategy (1,2) for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All students at Duke University, a private research university in Durham, North Carolina, signed the Duke Compact (3), agreeing to observe mandatory masking, social distancing, and participation in entry and surveillance testing. The university implemented a five-to-one pooled testing program for SARS-CoV-2 using a quantitative, in-house, laboratory-developed, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (4,5). Pooling of specimens to enable large-scale testing while minimizing use of reagents was pioneered during the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic (6). A similar methodology was adapted for Duke University's asymptomatic testing program. The baseline SARS-CoV-2 testing plan was to distribute tests geospatially and temporally across on- and off-campus student populations. By September 20, 2020, asymptomatic testing was scaled up to testing targets, which include testing for residential undergraduates twice weekly, off-campus undergraduates one to two times per week, and graduate students approximately once weekly. In addition, in response to newly identified positive test results, testing was focused in locations or within cohorts where data suggested an increased risk for transmission. Scale-up over 4 weeks entailed redeploying staff members to prepare 15 campus testing sites for specimen collection, developing information management tools, and repurposing laboratory automation to establish an asymptomatic surveillance system. During August 2-October 11, 68,913 specimens from 10,265 graduate and undergraduate students were tested. Eighty-four specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 51% were among persons with no symptoms. Testing as a result of contact tracing identified 27.4% of infections. A combination of risk-reduction strategies and frequent surveillance testing likely contributed to a prolonged period of low transmission on campus. These findings highlight the importance of combined testing and contact tracing strategies beyond symptomatic testing, in association with other preventive measures. Pooled testing balances resource availability with supply-chain disruptions, high throughput with high sensitivity, and rapid turnaround with an acceptable workload.	false
0	Community's perceived high risk of coronavirus infections during early phase of epidemics are significantly influenced by socio-demographic background, in Gondar City, Northwest Ethiopia: A cross-sectional -study. BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies during the early phase of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics reported different level of people's risk perception in different countries. There is a paucity of data on perceived high risk of COVID-19 and associated factors in Ethiopia. We sought to assess the prevalence of community's perceived high risk about COVID-19 infections and associated factors among Gondar town community., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 20 to 27, 2020 in Gondar town community, Northwest Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to recruit 635 participants. Structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to summarize the results., RESULTS: A total of 623 participants were considered in the analysis with a response rate of 98.1%. The prevalence of coronavirus high risk perceptions of the respondents was found to be 23.11% (95% CI; 19.80%-26.43%). Age above 45 years (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI; 1.19-2.66), college and above educational level (AOR = 0.28, 95%CI; 0.21-0.98), and poor knowledge towards COVID-19 virus (AOR = 1.57, 95%CI; 1.09-2.23) were significantly associated with perceived high risk about COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of perceived high risk of COVID-19 was found to be low. Factors such as age, educational status, and knowledge about COVID-19 virus were found to be independent predictors of perceived high risk towards COVID-19. Government and non-government organizations should use formal and informal means of educating the community.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody rearrangements in pre-pandemic immune repertoires of risk cohorts and COVID-19 patients. A considerable fraction of B cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 with germline-encoded elements of their B cell receptor resulting in the production of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups. Future studies will have to address if this stereotyped B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 emerging from unmutated antibody rearrangements will create long-lived memory.	false
0	Influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A Spanish nationwide prospective cohort study. Aims: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on attendance to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has only been described in city or regional settings. The impact of COVID-19 across an entire country with a high infection rate is yet to be explored. Method(s): The study uses data from 8629 cases recorded in two time-series (2017/2018 and 2020) of the Spanish national registry. Data from a non-COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period (February 1st-April 30th 2020) were compared. During the COVID-19 period, data a further analysis comparing non-pandemic and pandemic weeks (defined according to the WHO declaration on March 11th, 2020) was conducted. The chi-squared analysis examined differences in OHCA attendance and other patient and resuscitation characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression examined survival likelihood to hospital admission and discharge. The multilevel analysis examined the differential effects of regional COVID-19 incidence on these same outcomes. Result(s): During the COVID-19 period, the incidence of resuscitation attempts declined and survival to hospital admission (OR = 1.72; 95%CI = 1.46-2.04; p < 0.001) and discharge (OR = 1.38; 95%CI = 1.07-1.78; p = 0.013) fell compared to the non-COVID period. This pattern was also observed when comparing non-pandemic weeks and pandemic weeks. COVID-19 incidence impinged significantly upon outcomes regardless of regional variation, with low, medium, and high incidence regions equally affected. Conclusion(s): The pandemic, irrespective of its incidence, seems to have particularly impeded the pre-hospital phase of OHCA care. Present findings call for the need to adapt out-of-hospital care for periods of serious infection risk. Study registration number: ISRCTN10437835.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

0	Mental Health Disorders During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Cyprus. Cyprus has been affected by COVID-19 since March 2019. With a case fatality rate of 2.6% (until June 2020) and the social isolation measures enforced on the population, the population's mental health has been affected. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of the Cypriot population during the outbreak and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 216 volunteers regarding demographic data, COVID-19-related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and major depressive symptoms. The overall prevalence of GAD and major depressive symptoms of the public were 13.89% and 8.33%, respectively. No demographic had shown any statistical significance with GAD. The younger age group of the study showed a statistically significant association with major depressive symptoms when compared to the adult population in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Our study identified a mental health burden of the Cypriot population, especially the younger age groups. As part of the preparedness for situations as the one we are experiencing and the future impact the pandemic may have on society, interventions should be focused on vulnerable groups of the population to alleviate the psychosocial effects.Copyright ©Carol Davila University Press.	false

0	Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and has caused traumatic experience for nurses worldwide. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses, and how psychosocial factors influence nurses in this public crisis are unknown., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020., METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively., RESULTS: The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that COVID-19-related stress, relationship quality with family, and demographic characteristics were associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived health status. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was similar between nurses working in low-risk COVID-19 wards was as high as working in high-risk COVID-19 wards (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 0.784-1.481)., CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 factors and psychosocial factors were associated with mental health of nurses. The results suggest that hospitals should implement effective mental health promotion programs focused on occupational safety and family support to improve the well-being of nurses. Copyright © 2020.

0	Erythema Pernio-like in four Adolescents in the era of the Coronavirus-2 Infection. BACKGROUND: Although epidemic, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection rarely affects pediatric population. However, in the last months an increasing number of Italian pediatricians has reported the occurrence of erythema pernio-like in children following a flu-like syndrome, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE(S): To report cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 adolescents. METHOD(S): Observational study reporting 4 adolescents with skin lesions, 2 weeks after the occurrence of a flu-like syndrome. RESULT(S): Fourteen days after a flu-like syndrome, adolescents exhibited skin lesions to toes and feet. These lesions were rounded, with blurred limits, with a 5-15 mm diameter, red-violaceous-bluish colored, sometimes resulting in bullous lesions in correspondence of the central or apical portion, which tended to be covered with blackish crusts after evolution. Lesions were also accompanied by pain of variable intensity and evolved within two or three weeks to self-resolution without particular sequelae. In two patients, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the presentation of skin lesions. After 2 months from clinical manifestations, patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSION(S): In pediatric and adolescent population, the occurrence of an erythema pernio-like after a flu-like syndrome could be associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.	false
0	A Risk Model of Admitting Patients with Silent SARS-CoV-2 Infection to Surgery and Development of Severe Postoperative Outcomes and Death: Projections Over 24 Months for 5 Geographical Regions. OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery with subsequent risk of severe pulmonary complications and mortality., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on non-symptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death., METHODS: We developed two sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (e.g. United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population., RESULTS: Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92.000 (UI 68.000 to 124.000) pulmonary complications and almost 30.000 deaths (UI 22.000 to 40.000), respectively; for Europe, some 131.000 patients (UI 97.000 to 178.000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47.000 deaths (UI 34.000 to 63.000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18.700 (UI 13.700 to 25.300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6.400 (UI 4.600 to 8.600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259.000 (UI 191.000 to 351.000) pulmonary complications and 89.000 deaths (UI 65.000 to 120.000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 1.2 million pulmonary complications and 350.000 deaths., CONCLUSION: The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 on liver transplantation in Europe: alert from an early survey of European Liver and Intestine Transplantation Association and European Liver Transplant Registry. There are scarce data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on liver transplantation (LT) in Europe. The aim of this study was to obtain a preliminary data on incidence, management, and outcome of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients and candidates in Europe. An Internet-based survey was sent to the centers affiliated with European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR). One hundred nine out of 149 (73%) of ELTR centers located in 28 European countries (93%) responded. Ninety-four (86%) of the centers tested all donors, and 75 (69%) centers tested all LT recipients for SARS-CoV-2. Seventy-three (67%) centers selected recipients for LT in the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas 33% did not. Eighty-eight centers reported COVID-19 infection in 57 LT candidates and in 272 LT recipients. Overall crude incidence of COVID-19 among LT candidates and recipients was estimated 1.05% (range 0.5-20%) and 0.34% (range 0.1-4.8%), respectively, and it was significantly higher among candidates (P ' 0.001). Crude rate of death was 18% (10/57) among candidates and 15% (36/244) among recipients. This first large-scale European snapshot study clearly shows that both LT candidates and recipients are at a high risk for COVID-19. These results plead for an early and pro-active screening of COVID-19 symptoms in these populations.Copyright © 2020 Steunstichting ESOT. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false

0	Increased IL-10-producing regulatory T cells are characteristic of severe cases of COVID-19. Objectives: The pandemic spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is due, in part, to the immunological properties of the host-virus interaction. The clinical presentation varies from individual to individual, with asymptomatic carriers, mild-to-moderate-presenting patients and severely affected patients. Variation in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie this clinical variation., Methods: Using a high-dimensional systems immunology platform, we have analysed the peripheral blood compartment of 6 healthy individuals, 23 mild-to-moderate and 20 severe COVID-19 patients., Results: We identify distinct immunological signatures in the peripheral blood of the mild-to-moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, including T-cell lymphopenia, more consistent with peripheral hypo- than hyper-immune activation. Unique to the severe COVID-19 cases was a large increase in the proportion of IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells, a lineage known to possess anti-inflammatory properties in the lung., Conclusion: As IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells are known to possess anti-inflammatory properties in the lung, their proportional increase could contribute to a more severe COVID-19 phenotype. We openly provide annotated data (https://flowrepository.org/experiments/2713) with clinical correlates as a systems immunology resource for the COVID-19 research community.

0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is insufficient for the diagnosis of active or cured COVID-19. We assessed the performance of Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test device for the diagnosis of either active or cured COVID-19. Three cohorts of patients were chosen. Cohort 1, patients (n = 65) who attended the emergency department on March 30, 2020 with clinical suspicion of active COVID-19 (n = 56 with proven/probable COVID-19). Cohort 2, hospital workers (n = 92) who had either been (n = 40) or not (n = 52) diagnosed with proven/probable COVID-19 and were asymptomatic at the time of the sampling. Cohort 3, patients (n = 38) cared at the hospital before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of serum antibodies was done using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the PanbioTM COVID-19 IgG/IgM device. Both methods showed 98% agreement for IgG detection. No antibodies were detected in the 38 samples from hospitalized pre-COVID subjects. The diagnostic performance of IgGs detected by Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 assay in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (60.7%/75%) and specificity (100%/84.6%). The diagnostic performance of IgM by PanbioTM COVID-19 in Cohorts 1/2 was: sensitivity (16%/17.5%) and specificity (100%/98.1%). We show that IgG detection alone is insufficient for the diagnosis of active or cured COVID-19. IgM detection has a limited diagnostic value.	false
0	Effect of a previous history of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical picture of patients with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV: A preliminary study. Objectives: We explored the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) history on clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV in a designated hospital. Patients were divided into medicine (n = 12) and non-medicine (n = 8) groups according to previous ART history before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result(s): The median age was 46.5 years and 15 (75%) were female. Ten patients had initial negative RT-PCR on admission, five of which had normal computed tomography (CT) appearance and four were asymptomatic. Lymphocytes were low in nine patients (45%); CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 were low in all patients. The predominant CT features in 19 patients were multiple (42%) ground-glass opacities (58%) and consolidations (32%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly lower in the medicine than the non-medicine group [median (interquartile range, IQR): 14.0 (10.0-34.0) vs 51.0 (35.8-62.0), P = 0.005]. Nineteen patients (95%) were discharged with a median hospital stay of 30 days (IQR 26-30). Conclusion(s): Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection exhibited mild to moderate symptoms. The milder inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection might be associated with a previous history of ART in HIV-infected patients.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Of mice and men: The coronavirus mhv and mouse models as a translational approach to understand sars-cov-2. The fatal acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, infection and mortality rates have been rising steadily worldwide. The lack of a vaccine, as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies, emphasize the need to develop new strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis. Since mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 share a common genus, lessons learnt from MHV and SARS-CoV could offer mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we have focused on various aspects, including host species, organotropism, transmission, clinical disease, pathogenesis, control and therapy, MHV as a model for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as mouse models for infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans share various similarities, there are also differences that need to be addressed when studying murine models. Translational approaches, such as humanized mouse models are pivotal in studying the clinical course and pathology observed in COVID-19 patients. Lessons from prior murine studies on coronavirus, coupled with novel murine models could offer new promising avenues for treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Health care seeking due to COVID-19 related symptoms and health care cancellations among older Brazilian adults: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The continent of the Americas has the greatest number of people infected and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the world. Brazil occupies the 2nd position in numbers of infected cases and deaths, preceded only by the United States. Older adults and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has serious consequences for health services. Therefore, an assessment of the pandemic's effect on the older Brazilian population is urgently needed. The study examines the prevalence of COVID-19 related symptoms, care-seeking, and cancellation of surgery or other scheduled medical care among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over derived from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey (the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative) between late May and early June 2020. About 10.4% of older adults reported any fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing in the 30 days prior to the interview, with the highest prevalence in the North region (50%). Among individuals with symptoms, only 33.6% sought care. Individuals living in the South or Southeast regions were significantly less likely to seek care for COVID-19 related symptoms. Nearly one in six participants had to cancel scheduled surgery or other medical care; this proportion was higher among women, those with more education, and people with multiple chronic conditions. This paper is among the first to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on health care use in Brazil among older adults. Results highlight the need to adapt health care delivery (such as through telemedicine) to ensure the continuity of care as well as the urgent need for wide dissemination of information to guide the population on disease prevention measures and how to obtain healthcare when needed.	false
0	Management of refractory skin lupus. Management of refractory skin lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus involves combinations of local measures and systemic agents requiring adjustment to activity and development of the disease. The treatment options are fairly similar for the different cutaneous manifestations; however, no drugs have been licensed specifically for the treatment of skin lesions in this disease. Therefore, the aim of the European guideline was to achieve a broad consensus on treatment strategies for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) by a European subcommittee, guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and supported by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV). Standard treatment of CLE includes preventive measures such as smoking cessation and photoprotection. Ultraviolet (UV) A and B light is one of the most important risk factors for CLE, clearly documented by photoprovocation studies in large patient cohorts. In the past years, several trials have been performed to investigate the preventive effect of sunscreens in patients with UV-induced CLE. A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that the application of a broadspectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor prevents UVinduced skin lesions under standardised conditions. First-line treatment options in CLE include topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Currently available topical calcineurin inhibitors (0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, 1% pimecrolimus cream) have been licensed for the use in patients with atopic dermatitis. The major advantage of these agents is their better safety profile when compared to topical corticosteroids. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial showed significant improvement for oedema and erythema of CLE lesions using 0.1% tacrolimus ointment compared to the vehicle. In patients with disfiguring and widespread disease, systemic agents need to be applied. The first-line systemic treatment is antimalarials, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine or quinacrine, which are particularly recommended in patients with a high risk of scarring and/or the development of systemic disease. In addition, systemic corticosteroids are recommended as first-line treatment in highly active and/or severe CLE. Second- and third-line systemic treatments include methotrexate, retinoids, dapsone and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate acid, respectively. Thalidomide should only be used in selected therapy-refractory CLE patients, preferably in addition to antimalarials. Several new therapeutic options, such as B-cell- or interferon alpha-targeted agents, need to be further evaluated in clinical trials to assess their efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with CLE. In 2011, the monoclonal antibody belimumab, a B lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor, was introduced for SLE as an adjunct therapy for patients with autoantibody-positive disease who despite standard therapy show high disease activity, intolerance of other treatments, or an unacceptably high need for corticosteroids. Currently, a validated skin score is used to confirm the efficacy of belimumab on mucocutaneous manifestations. In summary, there is a high unmet need for new therapeutic strategies, such as B-cell- or interferon-targeted agents, focusing on cutaneous manifestations in lupus erythematosus. Therefore, innovative designs of randomised controlled trials are warranted to develop new therapeutic options for patients with refractory skin manifestations in this disease. Case 1: 40-year-old man with SLE and painful erythemato-violaceous lesions Marzia Caproni A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2013 based on photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, positive direct Coombs test, ANA, antidsDNA, Sm, Ro, La, RNP antibodies and low complement, followed by malar rash and discoid lesions on the ears. He started hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg/day, nicotinamide 500 mg/day, topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors with benefit, followed by reactivation of malar rash, worsening of immunological parameters, proteinuria and lupus nephritis two years later. Prednisone 25 mg/day and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 640 mg/day were added with good clinical and laboratory control. In March 2018 he was hospitalised because of suspected macrophage activation syndrome triggered by cytomegalovirus and MMF was withdrawn. As lupus reactivated, in May 2018 he restarted MMF 320 mg/day with prednisone 25 mg/day and HCQ 200 mg/ day. In August 2018, rituximab was administered because of the development of sensory neuropathy with no improvement, thus he underwent intravenous immune globulin treatment with control. In 2020, he developed painful erythemato-violaceous lesions associated with small bullae and ulcers on the distal phalanges of the fingers and toes and of the tip of the nose. Skin lesions were consistent with chilblain lupus. Topical corticosteroid was added. Systemic treatments were replaced by belimumab. Discussion Points * Specific and non-specific skin manifestations during SLE course * Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) guidelines * Chilblain lupus: differential diagnosis at the time of Covid-19 Case 2: 35-year-old female with SLE and erythemato-desquamative plaques Marzia Caproni A 35-year-old female was diagnosed with SLE in 2013 on the basis of discoid lesions of the face and head, photosensitivity, ANA positivity, lymphadenopathy, hypocomplementemia, leukopenia, low-grade fever and diffuse arthralgias. Comorbidities included Hashimoto's thyroiditis and fybromyalgia under L-tyroxine, baclofen and escitalopram treatment. She started HCQ 400 mg/day and prednisone 25 mg/day, tapering to 5 mg/day with initial control. After 2 years of treatment arthralgias worsened as well as skin lesions and laboratory findings. On examination, atrophic painful plaque of the scalp and erythemato-desquamative plaques on the face were revealed. Topical and IV corticosteroids were added without improvement. Patient also underwent methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, rituximab and azathioprine treatment without improvement. We introduced mepacrine 100 mg/day with skin lesion improvement. Due to the difficulty in finding the drug, the patient stopped the treatment with reactivation of the skin manifestations and systemic involvement. We started belimumab 660 mg IV with HCQ 400 mg/day, prednisone 5 mg/day, azathioprine 50 mg/day and duloxetine 60 mg/day with control. Discussion Points * Discoid lupus erythematosus: clinical and histopathological findings * CLE guidelines: topical treatments of discoid lupus erythematosus * CLE guidelines: mepacrine in recalcitrant cutaneous lupus erythematosus * Belimumab and skin lesions in SLE.	false
0	Viral RNA level, serum antibody responses, and transmission risk in recovered COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results: a population-based observational cohort study. Managing recovered COVID-19 patients with recurrent-positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results is challenging. We performed a population-based observational study to characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in recurrent-positive patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk. Of 479 recovered COVID-19 patients, 93 (19%) recurrent-positive patients were identified, characterized by younger age, with a median discharge-to-recurrent-positive length of 8 days. After readmission, recurrent-positive patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in recurrent-positive patients ranged from 1.8 to 5.7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3.2), which was significantly lower than the corresponding values at disease onset. There are generally no significant differences in antibody levels between recurrent-positive and non-recurrent-positive patients, or in recurrent-positive patients over time (before, during, or after recurrent-positive detection). Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. Whole genome sequencing of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. 96 close contacts and 1,200 candidate contacts of 23 recurrent-positive patients showed no clinical symptoms; their viral RNA (1,296/1,296) and antibody (20/20) tests were negative. After full recovery (no longer/never recurrent-positive), 60% (98/162) patients had neutralizing antibody titers of >=1:32. Our findings suggested that an intermittent, non-stable excretion of low-level viral RNA may result in recurrent-positive occurrence, rather than re-infection. Recurrent-positive patients pose a low transmission risk, a relatively relaxed management of recovered COVID-19 patients is recommended.	false
0	Hypoferremia is Associated With Increased Hospitalization and Oxygen Demand in COVID-19 Patients. Iron metabolism might play a crucial role in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n = 204), inpatients (cohort B, n = 81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n = 23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6 mumol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.

0	Intracellular complexes of viral spike and cellular receptor accumulate during cytopathic murine coronavirus infections. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infections exhibit remarkable variability in cytopathology, ranging from acutely cytolytic to essentially asymptomatic levels. In this report, we assess the role of the MHV receptor (MHVR) in controlling this variable virus-induced cytopathology. We developed human (HeLa) cell lines in which the MHVR was produced in a regulated fashion by placing MHVR cDNA under the control of an inducible promoter. Depending on the extent of induction, MHVR levels ranged from less than ~1,500 molecules per cell (designated R(1o)) to ~300,000 molecules per cell (designated R(hi)). Throughout this range, the otherwise MHV-resistant HeLa cells were rendered susceptible to infection. However, infection in the R(1o) cells occurred without any overt evidence of cytopathology, while the corresponding R(hi) cells died within 14 h after infection. When the HeLa-MHVR cells were infected with vaccinia virus recombinants encoding MHV spike (S) proteins, the R(hi) cells succumbed within 12 h postinfection; R(1o) cells infected in parallel were intact, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. This acute cytopathology was not due solely to syncytium formation between the cells producing S and MHVR, because fusion-blocking antiviral antibodies did not prevent it. These findings raised the possibility of an intracellular interaction between S and MHVR in the acute cell death. Indeed, we identified intracellular complexes of S and MHVR via coimmunoprecipitation of endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the two proteins. We suggest that MHV infections can become acutely cytopathic once these intracellular complexes rise above a critical threshold level.	false

0	Transmission mode associated with coronavirus disease 2019: A review. OBJECTIVE: In late December 2019 in Wuhan (China), Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, subsequently isolated and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2). In this review, the main transmission routes and causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review was carried out to recognize relevant research available until 10 April 2020. RESULT(S): The main transmission routes of COVID-19 have been the following: Animal to human and human-to-human pathways, namely: Respiratory transmission; oro-fecal transmission; air, surface-human transmission. Transmission from asymptomatic persons, healthcare transmission, and interfamily transmission have been well documented. CONCLUSION(S): SARSCoV2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility. It is presumed to spread primarily via respiratory droplets and close contact. The most probable transmission pathway is definitely the inter-human one. Asymptomatic patients seem to play a crucial role in spreading the infection. Because of COVID-19 infection pandemic potential, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity in order to gain an effective vaccine and flock immunity and reduce mortality as soon and as much as it is possible.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

0	Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS): providing resuscitative care. Little is understood about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there is limited literature available and few case studies exploring the observations of colleagues involved in managing patients with COVID-19. Children represent a small sample of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK but the reasons for this are relatively unknown. Most children are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms from COVID-19 infection. However, a small number have been identified who develop a significant systemic inflammatory response, referred to as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). PIMS-TS involves persistent fever and organ dysfunction. PIMS-TS can also share clinical features with other conditions including toxic shock syndrome, septic shock and Kawasaki disease. This article presents a case study to explore the resuscitative care provided to a ten-year-old child with suspected PIMS-TS.Copyright © 2020 RCN Publishing Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

0	Strategies to Maximize Available Resources With Minimum Cost Escalation for Improving Radiation Therapy Accessibility in the Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 Era: An Analysis for Asia. Purpose: There is widespread accord among economists that the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will have a severe negative effect on the global economy. Establishing new radiation therapy (RT) infrastructure may be significantly compromised in the post-COVID-19 era. Alternative strategies are needed to improve the existing RT accessibility without significant cost escalation. The outcomes of these approaches on RT availability have been examined for Asia. Methods and Materials: The details of RT infrastructures in 2020 for 51 countries in Asia were obtained from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Using the International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines, the percent of RT accessibility and the additional requirements of teletherapy (TRT) units were computed for these countries. To maximize the utilization of the existing RT facilities, 5 options were evaluated, namely, hypofractionation RT (HFRT) alone, with/without 25% or 50% additional working hours. The effect of these strategies on the percent of RT access and additional TRT unit requirements to achieve 100% RT access were estimated. Result(s): In 46 countries, 4617 TRT units are available. The mean percent of RT accessibility is 62.4% in 43 countries (TRT units = 4491) where the information on cancer incidence was also available, and these would need an additional 6474 TRT units for achieving 100% RT accessibility. By adopting HFRT alone, increasing the working hours by 25% alone, 25% with HFRT, 50% alone, and 50% with HFRT, the percent of RT access could improve to 74.9%, 78%, 90.5%, 93.7%, and 106.1%, respectively. Correspondingly, the need for additional TRT units would progressively decrease to 4646, 4284, 3073, 2820, and 1958 units. Conclusion(s): The economic slowdown in the post-COVID-19 period could severely impend establishment of new RT facilities. Thus, maximal utilization of the available RT infrastructure with minimum additional costs could be possible by adopting HFRT with or without increased working hours to improve the RT coverage.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false

0	Clinical features of patients with acute coronary syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a reduction in hospital admissions of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients has been observed globally during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, clinical features of those patients have not been fully investigated. The aim of the present analysis is to investigate the incidence, clinical presentation, and outcomes of patients with ACS during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at our institution between March 1 and April 20, 2020 and compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduced by 39.5% in 2020 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Owing to the emergency medical services (EMS) of our region, all time components of ST-elevated myocardial infarction care were similar during the COVID-19 outbreak as compared with the previous year's dataset. Among the 106 ACS patients in 2020, 7 patients tested positive for COVID-19. Higher incidence of type 2 myocardial infarction (29% vs. 4%, p = 0.0497) and elevated D-dimer levels (5650 mug/l [interquartile range (IQR) 1905-13,625 mug/l] vs. 400 mug/l [IQR 270-1050 mug/l], p = 0.02) were observed in COVID-19 patients. In sum, a significant reduction in admission for AMI was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 patients were characterized by elevated D-dimer levels on admission, reflecting enhanced COVID-19 related thrombogenicity. The prehospital evaluation by EMS may have played an important role for the timely revascularization for STEMI patients.	false
0	COVID-19-associated coagulopathy: The essential elements for the anesthesiologist-resuscitator. Coagulation disorders are commonly reported in patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia. These are associated to an increase incidence of thrombotic disorders associated with an increase mortality rate. D-Dimers concentrations > 3 Mg/L, fibrinogen > 8 g/L and decreased platelets count are associated with an increased thrombotic risk. These biological markers have to be closely monitored during ICU stay. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism could be difficult in this setting. However, it has to be evoked in case of worsening hypoxemia unexplained by other reason and/or right ventricular failure. The thrombotic risk can be scored to adapt the thromboprophylactic treatment, impaired renal function and overweight making it even more difficult.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS	false

0	The effect of lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil: evidence from an interrupted time series design. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide have implemented social distancing policies with different levels of both enforcement and compliance. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to estimate the impact of lockdowns on reducing the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Brazil. Official daily data was collected for four city capitals before and after their respective policies interventions based on a 14 days observation window. We estimated a segmented linear regression to evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown measures on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. The initial number of new cases and new deaths had a positive trend prior to policy change. After lockdown, a statistically significant decrease in new confirmed cases was found in all state capitals. We also found evidence that lockdown measures were likely to reverse the trend of new daily deaths due to COVID-19. In Sao Luis, we observed a reduction of 37.85% while in Fortaleza the decrease was 33.4% on the average difference in daily deaths if the lockdown had not been implemented. Similarly, the intervention diminished mortality in Recife by 21.76% and Belem by 16.77%. Social distancing policies can be useful tools in flattening the epidemic curve.	false
0	Accurate Diagnosis of COVID-19 by a Novel Immunogenic Secreted SARS-CoV-2 orf8 Protein. An accurate diagnostic test for early severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the key weapon to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We previously reported that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a unique orf8 accessory gene absent from other human-pathogenic coronaviruses. Here, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a novel immunogenic secreted protein and utilized it for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Extracellular orf8 protein was detected in cell culture supernatant and in sera of COVID-19 patients. In addition, orf8 was found highly immunogenic in COVID-19 patients, who showed early seropositivity for anti-orf8 IgM, IgG, and IgA. We hypothesize that orf8 secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitates early mounting of B cell response. The serological test detecting anti-orf8 IgG antibody can be used for the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Current commercially available serological tests for COVID-19 patients are detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike glycoprotein. The antinucleoprotein and antispike antibodies can be accurately detected in patients during the mid or late stage of infection, and therefore, these assays have not been widely used for early diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, we characterized the secretory property of a SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein and proposed that orf8 secretion during infection facilitates early mounting of the B cell response. We demonstrated the presence of anti-orf8 antibodies in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during the early stage of infection, while the anti-N antibody is not detected. Our serological test detecting anti-orf8 antibodies may facilitate the development of early and accurate diagnosis for COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Wang et al.	false
0	The impact of the immune status on COVID-19 severity. Aim. To investigate the impact of patient immune status on the severity of COVID-19. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 63 employees of the V.I. Kulakov NMRC for OG&P of Minzdrav of Russia with confirmed COVID-19. The patients were stratified into three groups based on the disease severity, including asymptomatic (group 1, n=17), mild (group 2, n=29), and moderate (group 3, n=17) form of COVID-19. On days 3-7 from the onset of the disease, peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the study subjects and tested for serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and immune profile by ELISA. After day 20+, testing for serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was repeated using ELISA. Results. Patients who had a higher BMI, blood group A(II), lower leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, higher relative monocyte count, changes in the immune profile in the form of a lower number of CD3+, CD3+ CD8+, SD19+, CD19+ CD5+, and phagocytic activity of neutrophils, developed more severe forms of COVID-19. They had severe clinical manifestations of the disease, and 100% of them developed antiviral immunity. Conclusion. This study identified several clinical, laboratory, and immune profile features that may be considered as predictive factors of severe COVID-19 and can be used in clinical practice to predict the clinical course of the disease.Copyright © A group of authors, 2020.	false
0	"Polyomavirus, Adenovirus, and Viral Respiratory Diseases. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) belongs to the genus Polyomavirus of the family Polyomaviridae that comprises 13 different species with human host (Calvignac-Spencer et al. 2016). BKPyV virions are small non-enveloped particles of 40-45 nm in diameter, with an icosahedral symmetry, resistant to heat, and environment exposure (Hirsch and Steiger 2003). Structurally, BKPyV consists of a circular 5.1 kb double-stranded DNA genome within a capsid made of proteins Vp1 on the outside and Vp2 and Vp3 on the inside. The BKPyV genome is divided into three regions: the noncoding control region (NCCR); the early viral gene region (EVGR); the late viral gene region (LVGR). The NCCR is responsible for DNA replication and bidirectional viral gene expression; the EVGR encodes the regulatory nonstructural proteins called small tumor antigen (sTag), large tumor antigen (LTag), and spliced variants called truncated Tag; the LVGR contains the genes for the structural proteins Vp1, Vp2, Vp3, and a small accessory protein of unknown function called agnoprotein. The Vp1 capsid protein is the main target of BKPyV-specific antibodies while LTag is used as target for immunohistochemical diagnosis in tissue samples. BKPyV was isolated for the first time in a patient (B.K.) who underwent a kidney transplant and presented in the urine particular epithelial cells with nuclear viral inclusions called ""decoy cells"" (Gardner et al. 1971). Subsequently, BKPyV has been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Apperley et al. 1987; Arthur et al. 1986), and nephropathy after kidney transplantation (Binet et al. 1999; Randhawa et al. 1999). Serologic studies showed that up to 90% of the adult population has been exposed to BKPyV during infancy and childhood (Egli et al. 2009). The infection can be asymptomatic or causes flu-like symptoms indistinguishable from other causes of viral community respiratory tract infections. The transmission is thought to be by direct person-to-person contact or by exposure to respiratory secretions. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in renal tubular epithelial and urothelial cells and asymptomatic viruria can be detected in 5-10% of healthy individuals (Hirsch and Steiger 2003; Egli et al. 2009). The urinary shedding increases to 60-80% in patients undergoing HSCT, as well as the BKPyV viruria load increases to less than 3 log10 to >7 log10 copies/mL (Cesaro et al. 2018a; Cesaro et al. 2015).Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."	false
0	Efficacy and safety of early treatment with sarilumab in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 presenting cytokine release syndrome (SARICOR STUDY): protocol of a phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial. INTRODUCTION: About 25% of patients with COVID-19 develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with a high release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). The aim of the SARICOR study is to demonstrate that early administration of sarilumab (an IL-6 receptor inhibitor) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, pulmonary infiltrates and a high IL-6 or D-dimer serum level could reduce the progression of ARDS requiring high-flow nasal oxygen or mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive)., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of the administration of two doses of sarilumab (200 and 400 mg) plus best available therapy (BAT) in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 presenting cytokine release syndrome. This strategy will be compared with a BAT control group. The efficacy and safety will be monitored up to 28 days postadministration. A total of 120 patients will be recruited (40 patients in each arm)., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The clinical trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the coordinating centre and authorised by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Products. If the hypothesis is verified, the dissemination of the results could change clinical practice by increasing early administration of sarilumab in adult patients with COVID-19 presenting cytokine release syndrome, thus reducing intensive care unit admissions., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04357860.

0	Pulmonary vascular improvement in severe COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab. As of October 2020 management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on supportive care and off-label or compassionate-use therapies. On March 2020 tocilizumab - an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody - was suggested as immunomodulatory treatment in severe COVID-19 because hyperinflammatory syndrome occurs in many patients similarly to the cytokine release syndrome that develops after CAR-T cell therapy. In our retrospective observational study, 20 severe COVID-19 patients were treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard-of-care therapy (SOC) and compared with 13 COVID-19 patients receiving only SOC. Clinical respiratory status, inflammatory markers and vascular radiologic score improved after one week from tocilizumab administration. On the contrary these parameters were stable or worsened in patients receiving only SOC. Despite major study limitations, improvement of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient as well as vascular radiologic score after one week may account for improved pulmonary vascular perfusion and could explain the more rapid recovery of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab compared to controls.

0	Safe Perinatal Management of Neonates Born to SARS-CoV-2 Positive Mothers at the Epicenter of the Italian Epidemic. Introduction: 2019-novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has recently struck Northern Italy. Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy and infancy, mostly from China. Herein, our experience on a safe perinatal management of neonates born to COVID-19 mothers is reported. Method: Since late February through May 15, 2020, 375 pregnant women delivered at our City Hospital in Piacenza, at the epicenter of the Italian epidemic. Of these, 144 were tested via a SARS-CoV-2 quantitative rRT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab prior to delivery, firstly on the basis of epidemiological and clinical criteria, then adopting a universal screening approach. All newborns from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at birth, on day 3 and/or day 7. In case of positive result, they were re-tested on day 14. Results: Fifteen women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All newborns except one were born at term. All of them were non-infected at birth, irrespective of mode of delivery; 13 out 15 remained negative; the two positive neonates became negative by day 14 of life. All of them have always remained asymptomatic. All newborns except two were allowed to have immediate bonding, permanent rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding. Conclusions: Our study supports the claim that COVID-19 in pregnancy is not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 pregnant women and/or with higher rates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction. Intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be unlikely. Breastfeeding appears to be safe and protective for the neonate, once appropriate preventive measures are adopted.

0	Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and COVID-19: systematic review and narrative synthesis of efficacy and safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has required clinicians to urgently identify new treatment options or the re-purposing of existing drugs. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The aims of this systematic review are to systematically identify and collate 24 studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and to provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Of clinical trials, 100% showed no significant difference in the probability of viral transmission or clearance in prophylaxis or therapy, respectively, compared to the control group. Among observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy, 58% concurred with the finding of no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes. Three-fifths of clinical trials and half of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects, 44% found a greater incidence of QTc prolongation and/or arrhythmias, 44% found no evidence of a significant difference, and 11% mixed results. The strongest available evidence points towards the inefficacy of CQ and HCQ in prophylaxis or in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With and Without Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection. Importance: Published data suggest that there are increased hospitalizations, placental abnormalities, and rare neonatal transmission among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., Objectives: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes., Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity., Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described., Results: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19., Conclusions and Relevance: In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women.	false
0	Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Saliva as Compared to Nasopharyngeal Swabs in Outpatients. Widely available and easily accessible testing for COVID-19 is a cornerstone of pandemic containment strategies. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the currently accepted standard for sample collection but are limited by their need for collection devices and sampling by trained healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to NPS in an outpatient setting. This was a prospective study conducted at three centers, which compared the performance of saliva and NPS samples collected at the time of assessment center visit. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sensitivity and overall agreement determined between saliva and NPS. Clinical data was abstracted by chart review for select study participants. Of the 432 paired samples, 46 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with seven discordant observed between the two sample types (four individuals testing positive only by NPS and three by saliva only). The observed agreement was 98.4% (kappa coefficient 0.91) and a composite reference standard demonstrated sensitivity of 0.91 and 0.93 for saliva and NPS samples, respectively. On average, the Ct values obtained from saliva as compared to NPS were higher by 2.76. This study demonstrates that saliva performs comparably to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Saliva was simple to collect, did not require transport media, and could be tested with equipment readily available at most laboratories. The use of saliva as an acceptable alternative to NPS could support the use of widespread surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Glasgow Early Treatment Arm Favirpiravir (GETAFIX) for adults with early stage COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: The GETAFIX trial will test the hypothesis that favipiravir is a more effective treatment for COVID-19 infection in patients who have early stage disease, compared to current standard of care. This study will also provide an important opportunity to investigate the safety and tolerability of favipiravir, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of this drug and mechanisms of resistance in the context of COVID-19 infection, as well as the effect of favipiravir on hospitalisation duration and the post COVID-19 health and psycho-social wellbeing of patients recruited to the study., TRIAL DESIGN: GETAFIX is an open label, parallel group, two arm phase II/III randomised trial with 1:1 treatment allocation ratio. Patients will be randomised to one of two arms and the primary endpoint will assess the superiority of favipiravir plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone., PARTICIPANTS: This trial will recruit adult patients with confirmed positive valid COVID-19 test, who are not pregnant or breastfeeding and have no prior major co-morbidities. This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Patients must meet all of the following criteria: 1. Age 16 or over at time of consent 2. Exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 3. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 on valid COVID-19 test 4. Point 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity scale at time of randomisation. (Asymptomatic with positive valid COVID-19 test, Symptomatic Independent, Symptomatic assistance needed, Hospitalized, with no oxygen therapy) 5. Have >=10% risk of death should they be admitted to hospital as defined by the ISARIC4C risk index: https://isaric4c.net/risk 6. Able to provide written informed consent 7. Negative pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential*) 8. Able to swallow oral medication Patients will be excluded from the trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 1. Renal impairment requiring, or likely to require, dialysis or haemofiltration 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Of child bearing potential (women), or with female partners of child bearing potential (men) who do not agree to use adequate contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the completion of study treatment 4. History of hereditary xanthinuria 5. Other patients judged unsuitable by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator 6. Known hypersensitivity to favipiravir, its metabolites or any excipients 7. Severe co-morbidities including: patients with severe hepatic impairment, defined as: * greater than Child-Pugh grade A * AST or ALT > 5 x ULN * AST or ALT >3 x ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2xULN 8. More than 96 hours since first positive COVID-19 test sample was taken 9. Unable to discontinue contra-indicated concomitant medications This is a multi-centre trial, patients will be recruited from in-patients and outpatients from three Glasgow hospitals: Royal Alexandra Hospital; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital; and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary., INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm of GETAFIX will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician plus favipiravir. These patients will receive a loading dose of favipiravir on day 1 of 3600mg (1800mg 12 hours apart). On days 2-10, patients in the experimental arm will receive a maintenance dose of favipiravir of 800mg 12 hours apart (total of 18 doses). Patients randomised to the control arm of the GETAFIX trial will receive standard treatment for COVID-19 at the discretion of the treating clinician., MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome being assessed in the GETAFIX trial is the efficacy of favipiravir in addition to standard treatment in patients with COVID-19 in reducing the severity of disease compared to standard treatment alone. Disease severity will be assessed using WHO COVID 10 point ordinal severity scale at day 15 +/- 48 hours. All randomised participants will be followed up until death or 60 days post-randomisation (whichever is sooner)., RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the experimental versus control arm using computer generated random sequence allocation. A minimisation algorithm incorporating a random component will be used to allocate patients. The factors used in the minimisation will be: site, age (16-50/51-70/71+), history of hypertension or currently obsess (BMI>30 or obesity clinically evident; yes/no), 7 days duration of symptoms (yes/no/unknown), sex (male/female), WHO COVID-19 ordinal severity score at baseline (1/2or 3/4)., BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be used in the GETAFIX trial. Both participants and those assessing outcomes will be aware of treatment allocation., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In total, 302 patients will be randomised to the GETAFIX trial: 151 to the control arm and 151 to the experimental arm. There will be an optional consent form for patients who may want to contribute to more frequent PK and PD sampling. The maximum number of patients who will undergo this testing will be sixteen, eight males and eight females. This option will be offered to all patients who are being treated in hospital at the time of taking informed consent, however only patients in the experimental arm of the trial will be able to undergo this testing., TRIAL STATUS: The current GETAFIX protocol is version 4.0 12th September 2020. GETAFIX opened to recruitment on 26th October 2020 and will recruit patients over a period of approximately six months., TRIAL REGISTRATION: GETAFIX was registered on the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) Database on 15th April 2020; Reference number 2020-001904-41 ( https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001904-41/GB ).

0	Longitudinal Changes on Clinical Features in 28 Children With COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify the occurrence of viral shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) during follow-up. Method(s): We retrospectively retrieved data from pediatric patients with COVID-19 from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in China. The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed during hospitalization and after discharge. Result(s): From January 23 to March 15, 2020, a total of 28 pediatric patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were followed for at least 1 month. The median age was 7 years (IQR 3.5-10) and none of the children progressed to severe COVID-19 during hospitalization. Ten patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 1 month after discharge while four patients tested positive during the 2nd month after discharge. Only three of 12 children showed detectable immunoglobulin-M (IgM) on day 5, 18, and 21 after illness onset, respectively. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 disease was relatively mild among children while a number did test positive after discharge from the hospital. Public health initiatives should thus adapt control measures targeted toward children.© Copyright © 2020 Liao, Liu, He, Hu, Xiao, Wei, Cai, Wang, He, Liu and Zhang.	false

BACKGROUND: E-learning has been adopted internationally as the alternative teaching or learning strategy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine to fill the academic gap that has been created by the existing reality of the pandemic due to nationwide closures. AIM: This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptomatology among Lebanese University Students during the COVID-19 Quarantine. METHODOLOGY: A quantitative cross sectional research design, where 520 undergraduate university students were surveyed regarding their satisfaction with e-learning and the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptomatology using depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 elements. RESULT(S): Learning through online platforms have given rise to depression and anxiety disorders among undergraduate university students, where there was a significant correlation between student satisfaction and prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSION(S): The sudden shift to exclusive e-learning methods of instruction have produced anxiety and depression symptoms among a significant portion of the students due to the stressful load of work required.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	GM-CSF Neutralization With Lenzilumab in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Case-Cohort Study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia., METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use investigational new drug application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. We also identified a cohort of patients matched to the lenzilumab patients for age, sex, and disease severity. Study dates were March 13, 2020, to June 18, 2020. All patients were followed through hospital discharge or death., RESULTS: Twelve patients were treated with lenzilumab; 27 patients comprised the matched control cohort (untreated). Clinical improvement, defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale, was observed in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (P=.006). Similarly, the proportion of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen<315 mm Hg) was significantly reduced over time when treated with lenzilumab compared with untreated (P<.001). Significant improvement in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin 6) and markers of disease severity (absolute lymphocyte count) were observed in patients who received lenzilumab, but not in untreated patients. Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells 2 days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab., CONCLUSION: In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with faster improvement in clinical outcomes, including oxygenation, and greater reductions in inflammatory markers compared with a matched control cohort of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to validate these findings is ongoing (NCT04351152). Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	A Pediatric Infectious Diseases Perspective of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children. Understanding the role that children play in the clinical burden and propagation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, is emerging. While the severe manifestations and acute clinical burden of COVID-19 have largely spared children compared with adults, understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, management, and prevention opportunities and the social and behavioral impacts on child health is vital. Foremost is clarifying the contribution of asymptomatic and mild infections to transmission within the household and community and the clinical and epidemiologic significance of uncommon severe post-infectious complications. Here, we summarize the current knowledge, identify resources, and outline research opportunities. Pediatric infectious diseases clinicians have a unique opportunity to advocate for the inclusion of children in epidemiological, clinical, treatment, and prevention studies to optimize their care as well as to represent children in the development of guidance and policy during pandemic response.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Initial Assessment of the Impact of the Emergency State Lockdown Measures on the 1st Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal. INTRODUCTION: Portugal took early action to control the COVID-19 epidemic, initiating lockdown measures on March 16th when it recorded only 62 cases of COVID-19 per million inhabitants and reported no deaths. The Portuguese public complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. The aim of this study was to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction of the burden on the healthcare system., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after initial lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 31st March 2020. We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention)., RESULTS: Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown. On April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed., DISCUSSION: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing demand on health services., CONCLUSION: An early lockdown allowed time for the National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures. When lifting more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary.	false
0	Predicting spatial and temporal responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 growth rates across 58 counties in New York State: A prospective event-based modeling study on county-level sociological predictors. BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been implemented in the New York State since the COVID-19 outbreak on March 1, 2020 to control the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Socioeconomic heterogeneity across counties closely manifests differences in the post-NPIs growth rate of incidence, which is a crucial indicator to guide future infectious control policy making. Few studies, however, examined the geospatial and sociological variations in the epidemic growth across different time points of NPIs., OBJECTIVE: To guide a more effective reopening plan while controlling the transmission, the current study aims at 1) identifying hotspots of the growth rate of COVID-19 incidence among the 57 counties and New York City in NYS over time, and 2) examining the association of COVID-19 growth rates after eight critical NPIs time points and most relevant county-level sociological predictors., METHODS: County-level COVID-19 incidence rates were retrieved from the Social Explorer Website between March 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020. 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 incidence were calculated for 16 selected time points, including the dates of eight NPIs and their respective 14-day-lag-behind time points. A total of 36 county-level indicators were extracted from multiple public datasets. Geospatial mapping and heatmap were used to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of county-level COVID-19 outbreak over selected NPIs-related dates. Generalized mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, controlling for the 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 testing rates, was employed to identify significant county-level predictors related to the changes of county-level COVID-19 growth rates over time., RESULTS: COVID-19 infection increased and peaked by the end of March (eta=22.50%). Growth rates of COVID-19 decreased by 50.48% after implementing NPIs such as closures of schools, non-essential businesses, parks, and subways. There was a geospatial shift in the region with the highest growth rates from New York metropolitan area towards Western and Northern regions over time. Proportions of population aged 45 years and above (beta=3.25 [0.17-6.32]), living alone at residential houses (beta=3.31 [0.39--6.22]), and proportion of crowd residential houses (beta=6.15 [2.15-10.14]) were positively associated with the growth rate of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, living alone at rental houses (beta=-2.47 [-4.83--0.12]) and rate of mental health providers (beta=-1.11 [-1.95--0.28]) were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rate across all 16 time points., CONCLUSIONS: There are geospatial differences in COVID-19 incidence after implementing different NPIs. Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and healthcare resource disparities at the structural and historical levels across counties need to be considered in infection control policymaking to narrow the unequal health impact on vulnerable populations effectively., CLINICALTRIAL:	false
0	Update on treatment of covid-19: Ongoing studies between promising and disappointing results. The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19. Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommen dations. At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence. Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020.Copyright © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

0	The D614G mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: Implications for viral infectivity, disease severity and vaccine design. The development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted an extensive worldwide sequencing effort to characterise the geographical spread and molecular evolution of the virus. A point mutation in the spike protein, D614G, emerged as the virus spread from Asia into Europe and the USA, and has rapidly become the dominant form worldwide. Here we review how the D614G variant was identified and discuss recent evidence about the effect of the mutation on the characteristics of the virus, clinical outcome of infection and host immune response.

0	Outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic. Importance: Recent reports from communities severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found lower rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Whether the pandemic has affected OHCA outcomes more broadly is unknown., Objective: To assess the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and OHCA outcomes, including in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 disease burden., Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a large US registry of OHCAs to compare outcomes during the pandemic period of March 16 through April 30, 2020, with those from March 16 through April 30, 2019. Cases were geocoded to US counties, and the COVID-19 mortality rate in each county was categorized as very low (0-25 per million residents), low (26-100 per million residents), moderate (101-250 per million residents), high (251-500 per million residents), or very high (>500 per million residents). As additional controls, the study compared OHCA outcomes during the prepandemic period (January through February) and peripandemic period (March 1 through 15)., Exposure: The COVID-19 pandemic., Main Outcomes and Measures: Sustained ROSC (>=20 minutes), survival to discharge, and OHCA incidence., Results: A total of 19303 OHCAs occurred from March 16 through April 30 in both years, with 9863 cases in 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [19.3] years; 6040 men [61.3%]) and 9440 in 2019 (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [19.2] years; 5922 men [62.7%]). During the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC were lower than in 2019 (23.0% vs 29.8%; adjusted rate ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87]; P < .001). Sustained ROSC rates were lower by between 21% (286 of 1429 [20.0%] in 2020 vs 305 of 1130 [27.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.97]) and 33% (149 of 863 [17.3%] in 2020 vs 192 of 667 [28.8%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]) in communities with high or very high COVID-19 mortality, respectively; however, rates of sustained ROSC were also lower by 11% (583 of 2317 [25.2%] in 2020 vs 740 of 2549 [29.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.98]) to 15% (889 of 3495 [25.4%] in 2020 vs 1109 of 3532 [31.4%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.93]) in communities with very low and low COVID-19 mortality. Among emergency medical services agencies with complete data on hospital survival (7085 total patients), survival to discharge was lower during the pandemic compared with 2019 (6.6% vs 9.8%; adjusted RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-1.00]; P = .048), primarily in communities with moderate to very high COVID-19 mortality (interaction P = .049). Incidence of OHCA was higher than in 2019, but the increase was largely observed in communities with high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 38.6 [95% CI, 37.1-40.1] per million residents) and very high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 28.7 [95% CI, 26.7-30.6] per million residents). In contrast, there was no difference in rates of sustained ROSC or survival to discharge during the prepandemic and peripandemic periods in 2020 vs 2019., Conclusions and Relevance: Early during the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC for OHCA were lower throughout the US, even in communities with low COVID-19 mortality rates. Overall survival was lower, primarily in communities with moderate or high COVID-19 mortality.	false
0	The RACCO Trial to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Ciclesonide for Asymptomatic and Mild Patients with Covid-19: A Study Protocol for a Multi-center, Open- labeled, Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no specific effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2; however, various COVID-19 treatment options are under investigation. It is vital to continue investigating the landscape of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and therapeutic interventions., OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to compare the pneumonia exacerbation rate between ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration and symptomatic treatment in COVID-19 patients and to determine the efficacy of ciclesonide (Alvesco R). The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety of ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration, changes in clinical and laboratory findings, and the number of viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 over time between the two groups., METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, exploratory, prospective, multi-center, parallel-group, open-label, randomized trial, a total of 90 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from 21 hospitals in Japan. Participants will be randomized to either the ciclesonide group receiving ciclesonide (Alvesco R) 400 microg dose three times a day over a seven-day period or to the symptomatic treatment group. Both groups will antitussives and antipyretics as required. Data collection for various parameters will be conducted on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 22, and 29 to record baseline assessments and the findings over an extended period. Computed tomography (CT) image scans prior to drug administration and 1 week following treatment will be compared, and efficacy will be confirmed by checking for pneumonia exacerbation. Primary endpoint analysis will be performed using Fisher's exact test to determine statistically significant differences in the pneumonia exacerbation rate between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups., RESULTS: The first trial participant was enrolled on April 3, 2020; recruitment is expected to be completed on September 30, 2020, while follow-up assessments of all participants are expected to be completed by October 31, 2020. The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal., CONCLUSIONS: The RACCO study will provide definitive comparative effectiveness data and important clinical outcomes data between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups. If the hypotheses that pneumonia exacerbation rate reduction is more significant in the ciclesonide treatment group than in the symptomatic treatment group and that ciclesonide is safe for use are valid, ciclesonide (Alvesco R) will serve as an important therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients., CLINICALTRIAL: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials NCT No jRCTs031190269., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT: DERR1-10.2196/23830.	false
0	Experience of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) patient care in the Amsterdam region: optimization of acute care organization. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic causes a large number of patients to simultaneously be in need of specialized care. In the Netherlands, hospitals scaled up their ICU and clinical admission capacity at an early stage of the pandemic. The importance of coordinating resources during a pandemic has already been emphasized in the literature. Therefore, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 admissions, national and regional task forces were established for the purpose of coordinating patient transfers. This review describes the experience of ROAZ region Noord-Holland Flevoland, in coordinating patient transfers in the Amsterdam region. In total, 130 patient transfers were coordinated by our region, of which 73% patients were transferred to a hospital within the region. Over a two-month period, similarities regarding days with increased patient transfers were seen between our region and the national task force. In parallel, an increased incidence in hospital admissions in the Netherlands was observed. During a pandemic, an early upscale (an increase in surge spaces) of hospital admission capacity is imperative. Furthermore, it is preferred to establish national and regional task forces, coordinated by physicians experienced and trained in handling crisis situations, adhering full transparency regarding hospital admission capacity.	false
0	"Live video adaptations to a mind-body activity program for chronic pain and cognitive decline: Protocol for the ""Virtual Active Brains"" study. BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) and cognitive decline (CD) are costly, challenging to treat, highly prevalent among older adults, and worsen each other over time. We are iteratively developing Active-Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count aided by a Fitbit. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and signals of improvement in emotional, physical, and cognitive function when delivered in-person to this population., OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (Health Enhancement Program; HEP) in older adults with CP and CD. Due to COVID-19 and qualitative feedback from former participants, both programs are delivered in an entirely virtual format via live video (Zoom). Here, we describe our virtual study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design. We will evaluate feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and cognitive function., METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are randomized to one of two programs: AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, institutional registries, and IRB-approved flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate sealed envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via secure live video. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-minute walk test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via live video at baseline and post-intervention. Primary outcomes are a-priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative measures, adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional function, as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, pain-specific coping, mindfulness)., RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F, 11 HEP) across two rounds. Only two participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline, 1 before first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline. In the first round, attendance is high (11/12 completed all 4 sessions so far) and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5/6)., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention but need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body and activity program to older adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for the virtual assessments and intervention delivery will inform treatment development for older adults generally and those with CP-CD specifically, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond., CLINICALTRIAL: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04044183."	false

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mandatory quarantine increased the risk of mental symptoms and, inferentially, emotional eating (EE). We investigated the EE prevalence and predictors during this pandemic. Overall, 638 women, ages 18-39, completed an online survey incorporating the Emotional Eating Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. We asked about nutrition and collected data on weight, height, and pandemic responses. Most respondents (47.2%) reported low EE; 40.4% were ""moderate"" and 12.4% ""high"" emotional eaters; 42.8% reported depression, 27% anxiety, 71% moderate stress, and 12.5% severe stress. The main EE indicators/predictors were fat intake (beta = 0.192, p = 0.004), number of meals (beta = 0.187, p < 0.001), sugar consumption (beta = 0.150, p < 0.001), body mass index (beta = 0.149, p < 0.001), stress (beta = 0.143, p = 0.004), energy intake (beta = 0.134, p = 0.04), and fast food intake frequency (beta = 0.111, p < 0.01). EE score correlated negatively with increased family income (beta = -0.081, p = 0.049). Higher stress correlated with worse sleep, less sleep, and less physical activity. Emotional eating is common among young Saudi women during the pandemic. We recommend healthy food choices and increased physical activity to improve sleep and mitigate stress.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."	false

We examined the rates of 6 types of COVID-19 racism and racial discrimination experienced by Chinese American parents and youth and the associations with their mental health. METHOD(S): We recruited a population-based sample of Chinese American families to participate in this self-reported survey study conducted from March 14, 2020, to May 31, 2020. Eligible parent participants identified as ethnically/racially Chinese, lived in the United States, and had a 4- to 18-year-old child; their eligible children were 10 to 18 years old. RESULT(S): The sample included 543 Chinese American parents (mean [SD] age, 43.44 [6.47] years; 425 mothers [78.3%]), and their children (N = 230; mean [SD] age, 13.83 [2.53] years; 111 girls [48.3%]). Nearly half of parents and youth reported being directly targeted by COVID-19 racial discrimination online (parents: 172 [31.7%]; youth: 105 [45.7%]) and/or in person (parents: 276 [50.9%]; youth: 115 [50.2%]). A total of 417 (76.8%) parents and 176 (76.5%) youth reported at least 1 incident of COVID-19 vicarious racial discrimination online and/or in person (parents: 481 [88.5%]; youth: 211 [91.9%]). A total of 267 (49.1%) parents and 164 (71.1%) youth perceived health-related Sinophobia in America, and 274 (50.4%) parents and 129 (56.0%) youth perceived media-perpetuated Sinophobia. Higher levels of parent- and youth-perceived racism and racial discrimination were associated with their poorer mental health. CONCLUSION(S): Health care professionals must attend to the racism-related experiences and mental health needs of Chinese Americans parents and their children throughout the COVID-19 pandemic via education and making appropriate mental health referrals.Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics	false
0	Endemic Non-SARS-CoV-2 Human Coronaviruses in a Community-Based Australian Birth Cohort. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 pandemic has drawn attention to abstract the CoV virus family. However, in community settings, there is limited information on these viruses in healthy children. We explored the epidemiology of the 4 endemic (non-severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2) human coronaviruses (HCoVs) by species, including acute illness episodes, risk factors, and health care burden in Australian children in the first 2 years of life. METHOD(S): The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases community-based cohort was a prospective study of acute respiratory illnesses in children from birth until their second birthday. Parents recorded daily symptoms, maintained an illness-burden diary, and collected weekly nasal swabs, which were tested for 17 respiratory viruses, including HCoVs, by real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULT(S): Overall, 158 children participating in Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases provided 11 126 weekly swabs, of which 168 were HCoV-positive involving 130 incident episodes. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were most commonly detected, accounting for two-thirds of episodes. Whereas 30 children had different HCoVs detected on different occasions, 7 were reinfected with the same species. HCoV incidence in the first 2 years of life was 0.76 episodes per child-year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 0.91), being greatest in the second year (1.06; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.33) and during winter (1.32; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.71). Fifty percent of HCoV episodes were symptomatic, and 24.2% led to health care contact. CONCLUSION(S): In children, HCoV infections are common, recurrent, and frequently asymptomatic. In future studies, researchers should determine transmission pathways and immune mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics	false

0	Atypical Variant of Guillain Barre Syndrome in a Patient with COVID-19. Objective: A rare variant Miller Fisher Syndrome overlap with Guillain Barre Syndrome is described in an adult patient with SARS-COV-2 infection., Case Presentation: The clinical course of a 45-year-old immunosuppressed man is summarized as a patient who developed ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia after upper respiratory infection symptoms began. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction. He progressed to acute hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring intubation and rapidly developed tetraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome. However, the clinical symptoms, along with positive anti-GQ1B antibodies, were consistent with Miller Fisher Syndrome and Guillain Barre Syndrome overlap. The patient required tracheostomy and had limited improvement in his significant neurological symptoms after several months., Conclusions: The case demonstrates the severe neurological implications, prolonged recovery and implications in the concomitant respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms on the spectrum of disorders of Guillain Barre Syndrome.

0	Detection-based prioritisation: Framework of multi-laboratory characteristics for asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers based on integrated Entropy-TOPSIS methods. Context and background: Corona virus (COVID) has rapidly gained a foothold and caused a global pandemic. Particularists try their best to tackle this global crisis. New challenges outlined from various medical perspectives may require a novel design solution. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers show different health conditions and no symptoms; hence, a differentiation process is required to avert the risk of chronic virus carriers. Objective(s): Laboratory criteria and patient dataset are compulsory in constructing a new framework. Prioritisation is a popular topic and a complex issue for patients with COVID-19, especially for asymptomatic carriers due to multi-laboratory criteria, criterion importance and trade-off amongst these criteria. This study presents new integrated decision-making framework that handles the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19 and can detect the health conditions of asymptomatic carriers. Method(s): The methodology includes four phases. Firstly, eight important laboratory criteria are chosen using two feature selection approaches. Real and simulation datasets from various medical perspectives are integrated to produce a new dataset involving 56 patients with different health conditions and can be used to check asymptomatic cases that can be detected within the prioritisation configuration. The first phase aims to develop a new decision matrix depending on the intersection between 'multi-laboratory criteria' and 'COVID-19 patient list'. In the second phase, entropy is utilised to set the objective weight, and TOPSIS is adapted to prioritise patients in the third phase. Finally, objective validation is performed. Result(s): The patients are prioritised based on the selected criteria in descending order of health situation starting from the worst to the best. The proposed framework can discriminate among mild, serious and critical conditions and put patients in a queue while considering asymptomatic carriers. Validation findings revealed that the patients are classified into four equal groups and showed significant differences in their scores, indicating the validity of ranking. Conclusion(s): This study implies and discusses the numerous benefits of the suggested framework in detecting/recognising the health condition of patients prior to discharge, supporting the hospitalisation characteristics, managing patient care and optimising clinical prediction rule.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases at a screening clinic during the early outbreak period: a single-centre study. Introduction. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019-2020 corona virus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. COVID-19 patients currently remain the primary source of infection. An epidemiological survey indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Fever is the most common symptom, although older people and those with comorbidities may experience fever later in the disease. Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages. Some cases might progress promptly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. Asymptomatic carriers and those in the incubation period may also be infectious. Aim. To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19 at the screening clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methodology. In this descriptive study, we analysed data of patients presenting to a newly established Covid-19 screening clinic in Rehman Medical Institute. Anyone who reported with new onset fever and/or cough was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the screening clinic. We documented and analysed demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, which included age, sex, travel history, clinical features, comorbidities and laboratory data of patients confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan from 15 March till 21 April 2020. Paired specimens of throat swabs and nasal swabs were obtained from 845 patients, ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR assay. Results. A total of 845 specimens were taken as described above. The positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 14.3%. Male and older population had a significantly higher positive rate. Of the 121 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 43.19 years (sd, 17.57) and the infections were more frequent among male gender accounting for 85 (70.25%) patients. Common symptoms included fever (88 patients, 72%), cough (72 patients, 59.5%) and shortness of breath (69 patients, 57%). Twenty-two (18%) patients had recent travel history outside Pakistan in the previous 14 days, the majority of whom had returned back from Saudi Arabia. Conclusion. In this single-centre, prospective, descriptive study, fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Old age (>50 years), chronic underlying comorbidities and travel history may be risk factors. Therefore, we concluded that viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in a screening clinic, which helped with isolation and cohorting of these patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Initial whole-genome sequencing and analysis of the host genetic contribution to COVID-19 severity and susceptibility. The COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for millions of infections and hundreds of thousand deaths worldwide in a short-time period. The patients demonstrate a great diversity in clinical and laboratory manifestations and disease severity. Nonetheless, little is known about the host genetic contribution to the observed interindividual phenotypic variability. Here, we report the first host genetic study in the Chinese population by deeply sequencing and analyzing 332 COVID-19 patients categorized by varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital. Upon a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests among five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical ill patients after the correction of potential confounding factors. Pedigree analysis suggested a potential monogenic effect of loss of function variants in GOLGA3 and DPP7 for critically ill and asymptomatic disease demonstration. Genome-wide association study suggests the most significant gene locus associated with severity were located in TMEM189-UBE2V1 that involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The p.Val197Met missense variant that affects the stability of the TMPRSS2 protein displays a decreasing allele frequency among the severe patients compared to the mild and the general population. We identified that the HLA-A*11:01, B*51:01, and C*14:02 alleles significantly predispose the worst outcome of the patients. This initial genomic study of Chinese patients provides genetic insights into the phenotypic difference among the COVID-19 patient groups and highlighted genes and variants that may help guide targeted efforts in containing the outbreak. Limitations and advantages of the study were also reviewed to guide future international efforts on elucidating the genetic architecture of host-pathogen interaction for COVID-19 and other infectious and complex diseases.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Most susceptible duo in COVID-19 crisis: A literature review. Background and Aims: December 2019 onward, the COVID-19 infection has created havoc in the world. This review aims to pool in the experiences of obstetricians and neonatologists to help provide some guidance to clinicians and researchers about managing COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and the neonates. The study analyzed the susceptibility of pregnant women and the neonates to COVID-19 infection and the disease severity and mortality in pregnant women and the neonates due to this infection. We also attempted to find evidence of vertical transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Material(s) and Method(s): Several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and EMBASE) were explored, and relevant articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 were collated. A total of 46 published articles and 1 press note were selected for this review. A few landmark studies published during the preparation of this review were also included. Result(s): A total of 558 COVID-19-positive pregnant women were studied in 5 case reports, 20 case series, and 1 press note, with 443 deliveries and 445 neonates (2 sets of twins). Of the 329 pregnant women in whom the disease severity was reported, 232 (70.5%) women had mild disease, and 72 (21.8%) women were asymptomatic. However, comorbidities did not affect the severity of the disease. There were 2 (0.35%) maternal deaths, 2 (0.43%) neonatal deaths, and 1 (0.22%) still-birth. Of the 452 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests done in neonates, only 3 neonates had symptoms and none died. Although the neonates of COVID-19-positive mothers were kept away from them, these neonates had high levels of serum IgM and interleukins, and the results of the RT-PCR test of their nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for the COVID-19 virus (even at 16 hours after birth). This suggests the possibility of vertical transmission. The reproductive tissue and breast milk tested negative for the COVID-19 virus. Conclusion(s): Pregnant women are not additionally vulnerable to COVID-19 infection or its severity, although recent studies show a high susceptibility in some ethnic groups. Maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality is low. Some evidence of vertical transmission is seen. Symptomatic disease in neonates is rare. Neonates can be left with their mothers, subject to the mothers practicing proper hand hygiene and using masks. The neonates should be breastfed.Copyright © 2020, Himalaya Drug Company.

0	Characteristics of the liver parenchyma according to the native CT examinations data at the stages of COVID-19 treatment. Purpose. To assess the liver density according to the data of native CT studies in patients with COVID-19, depending on the severity of the pulmonary parenchyma damage and the prescribed treatment, to compare the data with biochemical indicators, and also to demonstrate changes in density indicators over time. Material and methods. Lung CT data from 200 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. The density of the liver, spleen, and subcutaneous fat tissue was measured in all patients on the images of the upper abdominal cavity that entered the scan area. The ratio of the density of the liver to the spleen and to the density of the fat tissue was assesed. These indicators were compared with each other in two groups of lung tissue damage: CT 1-2 and CT 3-4. The CT 3-4 group was assessed in detail: the density indicators of the liver were studied in dynamics, and their relationship with biochemical indicators - during the initial study. A comparison was also made between two subgroups: patients taking tocilizumab and those without tocilizumab. Results. A decrease in liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density was observed in 35.5% and 47.5% of patients respectively. Liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density were lower in the CT 3-4 group than in the CT 1-2 group, and amounted to 43.9 HU versus 49.3 HU (p < 0.008) and 0.9 versus 1.0 respectively (p < 0.014). In the initial study, there were a moderate (r = -0.30; p < 0.05) and weak (r = -0.26; p < 0.05) negative correlation of liver density and the ratio of liver density to spleen density with serum albumin. When assessing the dynamics in patients in the CT 3-4 group, with each subsequent study, an increase in the density of the liver parenchyma and the ratio of liver density to spleen density was noted. The difference between the mean values of liver density at the first and at the fourth CT examinations was 11.85 HU. Liver density values were independent of treatment with tocilizumab. Conclusion. Liver density values were lower in patients with COVID-19 with the degree of lung parenchyma lesion CT 3-4, increased during treatment and did not depend on the prescription of tocilizumab. Evaluation and monitoring of the dynamics of liver density could become a useful parameter in determining the severity of the disease course. No strong relationships were found between the density parameters during primary CT and any of the biochemical parameters. A more detailed analysis of these changes in dynamics is required, which may suggest the prevailing mechanism of liver damage in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Youth Development.	false
0	Encephalitis associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus: A case report. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise and myalgia. Recent observations suggested possible neurological complications of COVID-19, including the first report of suspected viral encephalitis. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with -on nasopharyngeal testing- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe respiratory symptoms, followed by clinical and radiological signs of encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed an asymmetric FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left medial temporal cortex associated with mild gyral expansion. Lumbar puncture was normal and PCR's for SARS-CoV-2 virus on CSF were negative. Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications, like encephalitis. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is difficult as CSF analysis may be normal.Copyright © 2020	false

Intravenous immunoglobulin is a preparation of immune globulins containing antibodies given intravenously to patients with both inherited and acquired immunodeficiency disorders, such as primary immune deficiency diseases, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and bone marrow transplantation. This article discusses immune globulin products, routes of administration, and the role of the infusion nurse in the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin to the patient.	false
0	Different clinical presentations of two renal transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019: A case report. Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 has spread rapidly worldwide and disease spread is currently increasing. Data on the clinical picture of transplant recipients and management of the anti-rejection immunosuppressive therapy on COVID-19 infection are lacking. Case presentation: We report two cases of COVID-19 infection in renal transplant recipients with variable clinical presentations. The first patient presented with mild respiratory symptoms and a stable clinical course. The second patient had more severe clinical characteristics and presented with severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Both patients received a combination therapy including antiviral treatment and reduced immunosuppression therapy and finally recovered. Conclusion(s): We report COVID-19 infection in two renal transplant recipients with a favorable outcome but different clinical courses, which may provide a reference value for treating such patients.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Best-practice IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin use in patients with sepsis. Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Despite treatment being in line with current guidelines, mortality remains high in those with septic shock. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent a promising therapy to modulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and can contribute to the elimination of pathogens. In this context, there is evidence of the benefits of immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-enriched immunoglobulin therapy for sepsis. This manuscript aims to summarize current relevant data to provide expert opinions on best practice for the use of an IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin) in adult patients with sepsis. Main text: Sepsis patients with hyperinflammation and patients with immunosuppression may benefit most from treatment with IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin). Patients with hyperinflammation present with phenotypes that manifest throughout the body, whilst the clinical characteristics of immunosuppression are less clear. Potential biomarkers for hyperinflammation include elevated procalcitonin, interleukin-6, endotoxin activity and C-reactive protein, although thresholds for these are not well-defined. Convenient biomarkers for identifying patients in a stage of immune-paralysis are still matter of debate, though human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related expression on monocytes, lymphocyte count and viral reactivation have been proposed. The timing of treatment is potentially more critical for treatment efficacy in patients with hyperinflammation compared with patients who are in an immunosuppressed stage. Due to the lack of evidence, definitive dosage recommendations for either population cannot be made, though we suggest that patients with hyperinflammation should receive an initial bolus at a rate of up to 0.6 mL (30 mg)/kg/h for 6 h followed by a continuous maintenance rate of 0.2 mL (10 mg)/kg/hour for >= 72 h (total dose >= 0.9 g/kg). For immunosuppressed patients, dosage is more conservative (0.2 mL [10 mg]/kg/h) for >= 72 h, without an initial bolus (total dose >= 0.72 g/kg). Conclusion(s): Two distinct populations that may benefit most from Pentaglobin therapy are described in this review. However, further clinical evidence is required to strengthen support for the recommendations given here regarding timing, duration and dosage of treatment.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue. Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3) increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks. Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one's carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Pharmaconutrition revisited for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Does selenium have a place?. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic causing one of the biggest challenges for critical care medicine. Mortality from COVID-19 is much greater in elderly men, many of whom succumb to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by the viral infection. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19, new strategies are urgently needed. Selenium is an essential trace element with antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Poor nutritional status increases the pathogenicity of viruses and low selenium in particular can be a determinant of viral virulence. In the past decade, selenium pharmaconutrition studies have demonstrated some reduction in overall mortality, including how reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and infectious complications such as ARDS in the critically ill. Consequently, we postulate that intravenous selenium therapy, could be part of the therapeutic fight against COVID-19 in intensive care unit patients with ARDS and that outcomes could be affected by age, sex, and body weight. Our working hypothesis addresses the question: Could high-dose selenite pharmaconutrition, as an early pharmacologic intervention, be effective at reducing the incidence and the progression from type 1 respiratory failure (non-ARDS) to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, and new infectious complications in patients with COVID-19 patients?Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	COVID-19 and acute myocarditis: Current literature review and diagnostic challenges. INTRODUCTION: In the current literature, there has been an upsurge of cases of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. In this case-based review, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and in-hospital course of acute myocarditis. In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHOD(S): We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULT(S): 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION(S): Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature. There are a lot of difficulties in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis in the context of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Associacao Medica Brasileira. All rights reserved.	false

0	Kawasaki and COVID-19 disease in children: A systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To present scientific evidence based on a systematic literature review (PRISMA) evaluating the association of Kawasaki Disease (DK) and COVID-19 in children. METHOD(S): For the selection of studies, a combination based on the Medical Subject Heading Terms (MeSH) was used. The Medline (Pubmed), LILACS, SciELO, COCHRANE, and BIREME databases were used. The search period for the articles comprised the last 10 years (2010 to 2020). RESULT(S): 840 articles with potential for inclusion were retrieved, one of which met the inclusion criteria and the guiding question that consisted of evaluating the association of Kawasaki disease and COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSION(S): A significant increase in the incidence of Kawasaki-type diseases after the onset of the epidemic has been reported, suggesting an association between the COVID-19 epidemic and the high incidence of a severe form of KD. However, further studies are needed to conduct an investigation of the association between these two diseases.Copyright © 2020 Associacao Medica Brasileira. All rights reserved.	false

0	Association of Social Distancing, Population Density, and Temperature with the Instantaneous Reproduction Number of SARS-CoV-2 in Counties across the United States. Importance: Local variation in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the United States has not been well studied. Objective(s): To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included 211 counties, representing state capitals and cities with at least 100000 residents and including 178892208 US residents, in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020, and April 23, 2020. Exposures: Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data. Result(s): The 211 counties contained 178892208 of 326289971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) degreeC. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) Rtin the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in Rt(95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative Rtat 0 degreeC of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative Rtdecreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 degreeC, increased between 11 and 20 degreeC (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 degreeC. With a 70% reduction in visits to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7%) were estimated to fall below a threshold Rtof 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties (81.0%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1%) in the lowest density quartile.2Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather were associated with a decreased Rtfor SARS-CoV-2 in counties across the United States. These associations could inform selective public policy planning in communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic..Copyright © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

0	Risk Factors and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths worldwide. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and in-hospital outcomes of AKI in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective observational study in the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, which was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by the Wuhan government. AKI was defined and staged based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Mild AKI was defined as stage 1, and severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or stage 3. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate AKI risk factors, and Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality. Result(s): A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The median patient age was 70 years (interquartile range, 59-77) and 61.3% were male. Fifty-one (42.8%) patients developed AKI during hospitalization, corresponding to 14.3% in stage 1, 28.6% in stage 2 and 18.5% in stage 3, respectively. Compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI had a higher proportion of mechanical ventilation mortality and higher in-hospital mortality. A total of 97.1% of patients with severe AKI received mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was up to 79.4%. Severe AKI was independently associated with high in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.06-3.13). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum interleukin-8 (OR: 4.21; 95% CI: 1.23-14.38), interleukin-10 (OR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.04-10.59) and interleukin-2 receptor (OR: 4.50; 95% CI: 0.73-6.78) were risk factors for severe AKI development. Conclusion(s): Severe AKI was associated with high in-hospital mortality, and inflammatory response may play a role in AKI development in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

0	An elevated 8-isoprostaglandin F2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) in COVID-19 subjects co-infected with malaria. Introduction: the most recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) that causes COVID-19, subjected the entire world in turmoil health-wise and economically. With higher burden of malaria in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries coupled with fragile healthcare system and delivery, these may pose a threat in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria. Free radicals have been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of malaria and COVID-19 through Fenton's reaction and cytokine storm respectively. Method(s): the current research comprises of seventy-four (74) participants; 20 apparently healthy controls and 54 COVID-19 patients (34 among which were co-infected with malaria). Serum levels of 8-iso PGF2alpha and Alphatocopherol were determined among the study participants using ELISA technique and colorimetric assay, respectively. Result(s): results revealed statistically significant elevation of 8-iso PGF2alpha in COVID-19 patients co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients only, and this may be due to increase production of free radicals. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Alphatocopherol was observed in COVID-19 co-infected with malaria compared to COVID-19 patients due to increase utilization of antioxidants in counterbalancing the negative effect of free radicals generated. Conclusion(s): conclusively, SARS-COV-2 patients co-infected with malaria might be predisposed to oxidative stress and low Alphatocopherol. The increase in oxidative stress is proportional to malaria parasite density and inversely related to Alphatocopherol levels. This implies that oxidative stress is notably higher and such patients may have a severer form of the COVID-19. Increased 8-iso-PGF2alpha in co-infection and decreased alphatocopherol levels can reflect the severity and adverse outcomes compared to COVID-19 naive because of their tremendous involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of diseases.Copyright © Yahaya Muhammad et al.	false
0	Specific issues of influenza in children in the context of the COVID-19 season. The paediatric population is a typical source for the spread of influenza as well as other respiratory viruses in the population, including coronavirus, particularly in the case of mild or asymptomatic course. In predisposed at-risk individuals or in those aged two to five years old, however, it may become a life-threatening infection due to respiratory or neurological complications. Annual influenza vaccination is essential primary prophylaxis affecting the morbidity, complications, and mortality of this infection; still, it has been neglected in our country.Copyright © 2020 SOLEN s.r.o..

0	Do Lifestyle Changes of Renal Transplant Recipients During the Pandemic Reduce the Risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019?. Introduction: There is no published study regarding the effects of preventive measures on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequency in renal transplantation recipients. The aim of this study is to reveal the preventive measures taken by renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these measures influence the prevalence of the disease. Material(s) and Method(s): After detecting the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, we briefed all of our renal transplant recipients on preventive measures regarding COVID-19. Two months afterward, a questionnaire was prepared regarding the preventive measures practiced by renal transplant recipients, and patients were asked whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms or had received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Result(s): Among 132 patients, 68 were surveyed through telephone calls. During this time, 95.5% of patients were in isolation at home except for when seeing to their essential needs. Two (2.9%) patients were hospitalized due to increases in creatinine level and urinary tract infection. All patients have worn masks when going out and stated that they washed their hands more frequently. There was a decrease in the frequency of hospital controls in 79.4% of patients. Although 2 (2.9%) patients had complaints of dysuria and fever, they did not apply to the hospital because they thought hospitals carried risk during the pandemic. One patient had a cough with fever and was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 but tested negative. Discussion(s): It was determined that renal transplant recipients in our study population meticulously complied with preventive measures and increased the use of masks and hand hygiene practices. As a result, none were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Cell-free nucleic acid patterns in disease prediction and monitoring-hype or hope?. Interest in the use of cell-free nucleic acids (CFNAs) as clinical non-invasive biomarker panels for prediction and prevention of multiple diseases has greatly increased over the last decade. Indeed, circulating CFNAs are attributable to many physiological and pathological processes such as imbalanced stress conditions, physical activities, extensive apoptosis of different origin, systemic hypoxic-ischemic events and tumour progression, amongst others. This article highlights the involvement of circulating CFNAs in local and systemic processes dealing with the question, whether specific patterns of CFNAs in blood, their detection, quantity and quality (such as their methylation status) might be instrumental to predict a disease development/progression and could be further utilised for accompanying diagnostics, targeted prevention, creation of individualised therapy algorithms, therapy monitoring and prognosis. Presented considerations conform with principles of 3P medicine and serve for improving individual outcomes and cost efficacy of medical services provided to the population.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Localization of mouse hepatitis virus nonstructural proteins and RNA synthesis indicates a role for late endosomes in viral replication. The aim of the present study was to define the site of replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Antibodies directed against several proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein, including the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the putative polymerase (POL), helicase, and a recently described protein (p22) derived from the C terminus of the open reading frame 1a protein (CT1a), were used to probe MHV-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). At early times of infection, all of these proteins showed a distinct punctate labeling by IF. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein also displayed a punctate labeling that largely colocalized with the replicase proteins. When infected cells were metabolically labeled with 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate (BrUTP), the site of viral RNA synthesis was shown by IF to colocalize with CT1a and the 3CLpro. As shown by EM, CT1a localized to LAMP-1 positive late endosomes/lysosomes while POL accumulated predominantly in multilayered structures with the appearance of endocytic carrier vesicles. These latter structures were also labeled to some extent with both anti-CT1a and LAMP-1 antibodies and could be filled with fluid phase endocytic tracers. When EM was used to determine sites of BrUTP incorporation into vital RNA at early times of infection, the vital RNA localized to late endosomal membranes as well. These results demonstrate that MHV replication occurs on late endosomal membranes and that several nonstructural proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein may participate in the formation and function of the vital replication complexes.	false
0	Covid-19: Laboratory diagnosis for clinicians. An updating article. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid. Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development. Although the lungs are one of the target organs, the hypoxia mechanism is systemic and other organs begin to suffer both through lack of oxygen and through deregulation of inflammation control mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 by Associacao Paulista de Medicina.	false
0	Clinical characteristics and treatment strategies of 79 patients with COVID-19. Aim To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and summarize the treatment experience, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment reference for the front-line clinicians. Methods Seventy-nine patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Infectious Hospital of Anhui Provincial Hospital from January 22 to February 18, 2020 were selected as the research subjects. There were 55 cases in general group and 24 cases in severe and critical group. The clinical data of the two groups were collected and compared, including general conditions, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, computed tomography imaging of the lungs and complications. Results The average age of 79 COVID-19 patients was 45. 1 +/- 16. 6 years, and forty-five of them are males. The severe and critical group was older than the general group. Besides, there were more males and comorbidities. In terms of laboratory tests, the lymphocyte (LYM) count and albumin (A L B) decreased more significantly in the severe and critical groups. Moreover, the percentage of neutrophils (N E U), c-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (L D H), troponin I (cTnl) and urea nitrogen (BUN) increased significantly. Among all the patients, the types of antiviral drugs in severe and critical group were significantly more than those in general group; moreover, the glucocorticoids, gamma globulin and oxygen inhalation by nasal catheter were used more frequently in severe and critical patients. By the time of February 18, one patient died of acute large area cerebral infarction, 34 patients were discharged from hospital, and the rest were still receiving treatment. Conclusions The elderly patients with multiple cardiovascular diseases are more likely to get severe and critical COVID-19. They usually combine multiple organ or system abnormalities. Clinicians should make timely judgment and adjust the treatment plan according to the clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory examination results.Copyright © 2020 Publication Centre of Anhui Medical University.

0	Novel Coronavirus: What to Learn from a Microbiologist. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was declared in Wuhan, city of China. Later on, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The clinical course of the disease ranges from asymptomatic cases to fatal severe respiratory illness. Various laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of disease. The gold standard test is real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction), whereas antigen testing can be used as a point-of-care test. Antibody detectionby ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can be used for the surveillance of the immune response.Copyright © 2020 Women in Cardiology and Related Sciences.	false
0	Intracranial haemorrhage associated with systemic anticoagulation in ventilated COVID-19 Intensive care patients. Introduction: COVID-19 induces a pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable state with marked elevations of ferritin, C-reactive protein, interleukin, and D-dimers. Observed consequences include pro-thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a high rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and elevated D-dimers with high fibrinogen and low anti-thrombin levels. Pulmonary congestion appears to be due to micro-vascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathological examination.1 The acquired pro-thrombotic state and associated poorer outcomes seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients 2,3 have led to such patients being treated empirically with systemic anticoagulants. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have both been used.2,3 Methods: Review of COVID-19 positive adult patients admitted to the critical care unit between 10th March and 13th May 2020 with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation. Result(s): In that period we admitted 59 patients. 6 (10%) females, 56 (90%) males. 45 (76%) patients required therapeutic anticoagulation (27 UFH, 14 LMWH, 4 argatroban). 4 (8.9%) of the 45 anticoagulated patients suffered catastrophic intracranial haemorrhage and subsequently died. Discussion(s): The risk for any significant haemorrhage in patients systemically anticoagulated for VTE with unfractionated heparin (UFH) is 2-3%, 4 and that of anticoagulant-related intracranial haemorrhage (AICH) in patients systemically anticoagulated with UFH is 1-2.7% (in patients treated for ischaemic stroke) and 4% with argatroban.5 We report a much higher incidence of nearly 9%. The cases we present fulfilled the advised criteria for systemic anticoagulation. Despite four-hourly monitoring of APPT and anti-Xa activity on the intensive care unit there were significant fluxes in these laboratory markers of anticoagulation. These may be associated with the uncharted nature of this disease process.It is impossible to disassociate the necessary therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation with the observed heightened frequency of life-ending intracranial haemorrhage in these patients.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Reducing patient harm following inadvertent endobronchial placecement of nasogastric tubes in patients with SARS-COV-2. Introduction: Nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion is essential for enteral feeding but can potentially cause significant injury to the lungs (1). Following a critical incident, we audited our practice of NGT insertion and the consequences of injury in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 caused by the (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Method(s): NGT insertion followed a local standard safety protocol and were inserted by consultants or senior registrars in anaesthesia and critical care medicine, or advanced critical care practitioners. Individual practitioners were able to choose their technique of insertion. All patients had their post-NGT insertion chest x-ray reviewed and those with misplaced NGTs had their case notes reviewed. Early in the outbreak, blind insertion was recommended in our institution to reduce aerosolisation, this was rapidly changed to direct visualisation with laryngoscopy as our experience managing SARS-CoV-2 patients increased. Result(s): During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a total of 135 NGTs were inserted into ventilated and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients. All of NGTs positioned were confirmed by a chest radiograph. Eleven (8.1%) were inadvertently endobronchial, of which four developed pneumothoraces (figure 1). Three patients (including both who had received ECMO) died and a fourth is currently undergoing a prolonged respiratory wean. No patients were fed or received drugs via a misplaced NGT. Chest radiograph of patient with inadvertent NGT placement in right lower lobe. Note the path of the tube suggests breech of the bronchial tree and direct injury to the lung parenchyma (arrowhead). A CT the following day showed a large pneumothorax (arrowhead), some haemothorax (black arrow) and severe ground glass changes consistent with SARS-CoV-2 (white arrow). Discussion(s): Our inadvertent endobronchial NGT rate is relatively high, compared to our previous clinical experience, which we believe may be related to the challenges of working with cumbersome personal protective equipment and/or changed practice to attempt to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (2). We suspect the lung parenchyma is particularly fragile in acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to the high rate of pleural breech and subsequent poor outcome (3). We recommend experienced operators place NGTs and do so using direct or videolaryngoscopy to minimise the risk of incorrect placement. We would like to thank the families of our patients for their permission to share the images in this work.Copyright © 2020	false
0	A comprehensive review on viral zoonosis: Emphasizing on pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prevention strategies and future perspectives. Zoonoses are human diseases caused by animal pathogens or animal diseases that are transmissible to humans. They are caused by all types of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses, and prions. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted to humans by infected saliva, aerosols, contaminated urine or feces, and direct contact with the animal or pathogenic microbes. Furthermore, transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea). The zoonotic microbes continue to evolve and adapt with tremendous acceleration and expansion of global trade, human movement, and population. Control of zoonotic diseases and protection of public health are challenging tasks as the world population is increasing proportionately. Newly emerging viruses such as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus, and the avian influenza virus, H1N1 virus, Nipah virus, Zika Virus, and now Covid-19 are serious threats to public health and have become a global concern. The prevention of these infections depends on improved diagnosis and highly effective therapeutics/ prophylactics. In this review, most important zoonotic infections, along with their specific etiology, transmission (role of wild-life) manifestations and epidemiology and control/preventive measures, are described so as to create awareness of the scientific/public health community.Copyright All © 2013 are reserved by the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research.

0	Acute transverse myelitis in COVID-19 infection. A 60-year-old man presented to hospital with bilateral lower limb weakness, urinary retention and constipation. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 10 days prior. Clinical examination revealed global weakness, increased tone, hyperreflexia and patchy paresthesia in his lower limbs bilaterally. Preliminary blood tests performed revealed a mildly elevated C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate but was otherwise unremarkable. MRI scan of his whole spine demonstrated hyperintense T2 signal centrally from T7 to T10, suggestive of acute transverse myelitis. A lumbar puncture showed elevated protein count but normal glucose and white blood cell count. Serological testing for other viruses was negative. His neurological symptoms improved significantly after treatment with intravenous methylprednisone. This case highlights a potential neurological complication of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

0	Clinical application of Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. Background: The unsatisfactory accuracy and capacity of real time RT-PCR depends on several unavoidable reasons, which cannot meet the demands for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). Results: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o.. Conclusions: The CMIA can provide important complementation to nucleic acid assay and help to enhance the accuracy and capacity of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false

0	Analysis of humoral immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a pandemic with tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. Here, the humoral immune response of a cohort of 143 COVID-19 patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany was characterized. METHOD(S): SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULT(S): COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. CONCLUSION(S): The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Strategies to HALT 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread for organ transplantation programs at the Sichuan academy of medical science and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, China. Originated from Wuhan and expanded throughout China and the world, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), has caused worldwide attention. As of March 21, the overall confirmed cases reached to 0.2 million in 172 countries. In all Chinese Medical Centers, elective surgery and the living donor transplantation has been suspended due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. In contrast, the cadaveric donor transplantations were mostly performed. Therefore, strategies to interrupt transmission within transplantation wards were essential. To date, we have performed at our center ten cases of kidney, four liver and two lung transplants (from deceased organ donors) during the coronavirus outbreak in China (from January 24th to March 11th, 2020). Based on our experience in combating the coronavirus while performing these organ transplants, we comprehensively address here the strategies for the prevention of the virus spread within the transplantation wards. Donor management The potential organ donors were cleared for epidemiology history and should not have traveled from or have contact with people from epidemic areas. Virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab specimens was determined, and chest CT was performed. Only when they were confirmed negative for coronavirus, related laboratory tests as HLA typing of donor, antibody detection of the receptor and complement dependent cytotoxicity test could be performed. Recipient management The potential recipients were screened for coronavirus (nucleic acid determination and chest CT scanning) on admission day. Further, additional information was collected from the recipient such as travel history, close contacts, daily body temperature and respiratory symptoms. During the hospitalization period, recipients received COVID-19 related education. Meanwhile, they were given new surgical masks every six hours. We also collaborated with psychologists to provide consultations. Post-transplant immunosuppression was maintained at usual doses. If the recipient had fever, cough, diarrhea or pulmonary infection manifestations, the patient was considered as suspected for contamination and was quarantined within an isolation ward. Accompanying family members of recipients also received COVID-19 related screening as mentioned above. In addition, regular visits were not allowed. Prevention of hospitalacquired infections We implemented strict protocols in preventions of HAIs, including training of HCPs and providing personal protective equipment. Outcome of the organ transplant recipients From January 24th to March 11th, we successfully performed 16 organ transplant operations (10 kidney, 4 liver and 2 lung transplants).	false
0	Cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the French Alps, February 2020. Background. On 7 February 2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. Methods. We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. Results. The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. Conclusions. The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	A tool for early prediction of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19): A multicenter study using the risk nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China. Background. Because there is no reliable risk stratification tool for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective model for early identification of cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods. In this retrospective multicenter study, 372 hospitalized patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were followed for > 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and those who maintained a nonsevere state were assigned to the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. Based on baseline data of the 2 groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance. Results. The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, and the 2 independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.4%) patients developed severe COVID-19. Older age; higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and direct bilirubin; and lower albumin were associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.912 [95% confidence interval {CI},.846-.978]; sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 87.6%) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.853 [95% CI,.790-.916]; sensitivity 77.5%, specificity 78.4%). The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analyses indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit. Conclusions. Our nomogram could help clinicians with early identification of patients who will progress to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe disease.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Ability of the immune system to fight viruses highlighted by cytometry and T-cell receptor clonotype assessment: Lessons taken before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak. The intriguing aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the high rate of spread and rapid progression of pneumonitis. Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to quickly build the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage of past analogues. When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor gammadelta cells are in the first line of defense, activated by stress molecules and recognizing some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex-independent but still specific, eg, cytomegalovirus, as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism-both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2. Most deaths occur due to pneumonitis, in the course of which overwhelming inflammation impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation. In fatal cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails and, therefore, patients at risk, mostly the elderly, show higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and enhanced inflammation in the lungs. Apparently, there is no feedback control over the antibody production. The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype-associated negative control of antibody production. Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, considering the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells. The use of these 2 immunotherapeutic tools is understandable based on basic immunology and this knowledge may direct the efforts of the medical community aimed at combating the virus.© Copyright by the Author(s), 2020	false
0	Analytical insights of COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). Genomic analysis has revealed that bat and pangolin coronaviruses are phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2. The actual origin and passage history of the virus are unknown, but human-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed. Several diagnostic techniques have been developed to detect COVID-19 in this prevailing pandemic period. In this review, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. The origin, structure, current diagnostic techniques, such as molecular assays based on oligonucleotides, immunoassay-based detection, nanomaterial-based biosensing, and distinctive sample based detection are also discussed. Furthermore, our review highlights the admissible treatment strategies for COVID-19 and future perspectives on the development of biosensing techniques and vaccines for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease, respectively.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Testing for COVID-19: When, who, and what test?. The laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is essentially based on three modalities. The reference method in lieu of viral culture is the molecular amplification assays, mostly by using the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, due to its complexity, needed equipment and expertise as well as the high expense, other assay modalities have been introduced. These include antigen-based and antibody-based detection assays. This article provides a consolidated approach that will shed light on the different formats and utilities that these assays are intended for at this stage in time, addressing when, who, and what in the testing of COVID-19. It is worth noting that a combination of different assays is advisable to settle interpretation of test results to reflect the true scope of the patient's condition.Copyright © 2020 Lebanese Order of Physicians.

0	104 Associations between Neighborhood Disadvantage Measures and COVID-19 Case Clusters. Study Objectives: The spatial distribution of COVID-19 remains to be described, though there is growing evidence of an increased burden among already disadvantaged populations and neighborhoods. Understanding the pattern of population risk is critically important for health systems and policy makers responding to the pandemic. Our aims were: 1) to describe the association between neighborhood factors and incident cases of COVID-19; and 2) to examine the changes in cases over time. We hypothesized that there would be an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and case clusters. Method(s): We analyzed data from patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston, MA from 2/5/20 to 5/4/20. Patient mailing addresses were geocoded to census tracts within a 20-mile radius of Boston. COVID-19 incidence per census tract was calculated using Empirical Bayes smoothed rates to adjust for small area estimation. Clustering of cases at the census tract level were assessed using local Moran's I, accounting for multiple comparisons. Quantile local spatial autocorrelation was used to determine the spatial association between neighborhood demographic and disadvantage measures (from the American Community Survey) and census tracts with high incidence of COVID-19. Poisson regression models were used to assess the independent associations between neighborhood factors and COVID-19. Finally, we mapped the distribution of cases in the study area over time. Result(s): As of May 4, 2020, there were 9,898 patients in the study area who had been treated in the health care system for COVID-19. The overall crude incidence was 31.8 cases per 10,000 population; adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2.3 to 405.1 per 10,000 population. Two case clusters were identified in the Chelsea/Everett and Lynn areas (p=0.007). We found statistically significant co-location of the top quintile of cases with several neighborhood factors (all p<0.05): % of population Hispanic (n=72 census tracts), black (n=36), uninsured (n=33), receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (n=39), and living in poverty (n=23). In the adjusted model, factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 were a higher proportion of Hispanic population (aIRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.21-1.28) and households receiving SNAP benefits (aIRR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.13). The distribution of cases varied over time, but with persistently high incidence in communities north of Boston. Conclusion(s): We found a significant association between neighborhood disadvantage measures and high incidence rates of COVID-19. Limitations include case ascertainment challenges due to access to testing and possible selection bias from use of a single health care system. These results suggest that policy makers should consider health inequities as they respond to the ongoing pandemic and plan for future health needs. [Formula presented]Copyright © 2020	false
0	Pregnancy and Zika virus. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the genus Flavivirus and the Flaviviridae family. In 1947 and 1948 ZIKV was first isolated from a nonhuman primate as well as from mosquitoes in Africa, respectively. For half a century, ZIKV infections in human were sporadic prior to 2015-2016 pandemic spreading. Transmission of ZIKV from mother to fetus can occur in any trimester of pregnancy, even if mother was an asymptomatic carrier. The clinical signs of ZIKV infection are nonspecific and can be misdiagnosed as some other infectious diseases, especially those caused by arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya. ZIKV infection was solely associated with mild illness prior to the large French Polynesian and Brazil outbreaks, when severe neurological complications, Guillain-Barre syndrome and dramatically increased rate of severe congenital malformations (including microcephaly) were reported. The adaptation of ZIKV to an urban cycle in endemic areas suggests that the incidence of ZIKV infections may be underestimated. The pandemic of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) demonstrates that lessons from ZIKV pandemic propagation has not been learned properly.Copyright © 2020 Universidad de Antioquia.

0	Maternal and perinatal characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 in a national hospital in Lima, Peru. Introduction: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 100 countries. Specific information about its behavior in pregnancy is still limited. Objective(s): To describe the maternal and perinatal characteristics of pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns in a tertiary referral hospital. Method(s): Descriptive study. Subjects were all pregnant patients admitted to the OB/ GYN Emergency Department of the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital from March 24 to May 7, 2020, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid test or by RT-PCR test. Medical and hospital records were reviewed to retrieve sociodemographic data, patient's history, clinical manifestations, maternal serology, obstetric complications, delivery mode and perinatal aspects. Result(s): 41 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 were identified. 9.2% of all admissions had a positive rapid test. The most common symptoms were cough in 84.6%, fever in 76.9% and sore throat in 61.5%. 68.2% of the patients were asymptomatic, 19.5% had mild illness and 7.3 %, moderate. 2 cases progressed to severe pneumonia requiring non-invasive ventilation. No maternal deaths were recorded. 21.7% were vaginal deliveries, while 78.3% were C-sections. One baby born in a vaginal delivery had a positive PCR result on day 8. Conclusion(s): A large percentage of asymptomatic pregnant patients had a positive PCR test. Implementing universal screening among patients in labor as part of the pregnant patient flow protocol is necessary for all institutions.Copyright © 2020 Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Facultad de Medicina Alberto Hurtado.	false
0	The current status and perspectives for the emerging pandemic: Covid-19. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the extremely communicable viral infection coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19). Initially the virus was found at Wuhan, china which spread across the world exponentially and in a very short span. This outbreak has turned out to be a global health crisis and recently WHO regarded it as pandemic. The origin of the virus is predicted as either the natural selection in animal host prior to the transfer of the pathogen from animals to humans or the natural selection in humans and following transfer. Nevertheless, there is an extensive spread of virus by human to human transfer in the form of droplets. A few antiviral drugs are at the stage of clinical trials to eradicate the covid-19. In this review, a comprehensive approach is put forth to scrutinise the etiology, pathogenicity and transmission of SARS CoV-2. The review also deliberates broadly on the diagnosis and status of therapeutic treatment developed. It also focuses on the preventive and controlling measures from different sectors of the society. The review covers the details reported in 70 studies which were chosen after keyword searches carried out leading to over 884 resulting articles.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.	false
0	"[Analysis of pathogenesis, syndrome differentiation and treatment of asymptomatic infectors of coronavirus disease 2019 based on the theory of ""pathogen hiding in the pleurodiaphragmatic interspace""]. Among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), compared with the symptomatic infection patients, 2019-nCoV carried by asymptomatic infection patients are more likely to be widely spread due to secrecy and neglect, thus brings severe challenges to the current prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The therapies of asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infection are still in research. Through excavating the Chinese medical classics, it was found that the theory of ""pathogen hiding in the pleurodiaphragmatic interspace"", with its unique syndrome differentiation system and curative effect of treating symptoms and causes, can provide clinical reference for the treatment of asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infections and provide theoretical basis traditional Chinese medicine in the battle against infectious diseases."	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Induce IFNG in Th1 Lymphocytes Generated from CD4+ Cells from Healthy, Unexposed Polish Donors. The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019 has caused the deaths of several hundred thousand people worldwide. Currently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is poorly understood. During the course of COVID-19 infection, many patients experience deterioration, which might be associated with systemic inflammation and cytokine storm syndrome; however, other patients have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. There are some suggestions that impaired cellular immunity through a reduction in Th1 response and IFNG (interferon gamma) expression, as well as cross-reactivity with common cold coronaviruses, might be involved in the differential COVID-19 course. Here, we show that CD4+ cells isolated from unexposed healthy donors that were differentiated towards the Th1 lineage in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins exhibited induction of IFNG. Interestingly, the same cells induced to differentiate towards a Th17 lineage did not exhibit changes in IFNG expression or Th17-related cytokines. This suggests the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins is primarily associated with Th1 lymphocytes and may be dependent on past infections with common cold coronaviruses or vaccinations that induce unspecific cellular responses, e.g., BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin). Thus, our results might explain the high variability in the course of COVID-19 among populations of different countries.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019: Clinical review. Introduction: In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei Province and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization since January 2020. Material(s) and Method(s): A comprehensive search using the PubMed database was carried out to summarize the latest published information about the epidemiology, definition, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, treatment options, prognosis and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019. Discussion(s): This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart, causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by nucleic acid testing. Conclusion(s): Despite intensive research, the exact origin of the virus and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease is not yet completely known, and clinically approved vaccines and drugs that target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are lacking.Copyright © Ordem dos Medicos 2020	false
0	Clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality of covid-19 adult patients in saudi arabia. Objectives: To provide a detailed study of demographic, baseline comorbidities, clinical features, and outcome for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Method(s): A record-based case-series study conducted from March 23 to June 15, 2020 in King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, complications, and in-hospital outcome of COVID-19 patients collected with analysis of the clinical characteristics for survivors and deceased. Original Article Results: A total of 768 patients were included. The mean age was 46.36+/-13.7 years and 76.7% were men. Approximately 96.3% reported more than one comorbidity; diabetes mellitus was the most frequent (46.4%). Fever (84.5%), cough (82.3%), and shortness of breath (79.8%) were the main presenting symptoms. During the follow-up, pneumonia reported in 68.6%, acute respiratory distress syndrome in 32.7%, septic shock in 20.7%, respiratory failure in 20.3%, and acute kidney injury in 19.3%. Approximately 45.8% of enrolled patients required intensive care unit admission. Lung disease (odd ratio [OR]=3.862 with 95% confident interval [CI] (2.455-6.074), obesity (OR=3.732, CI=2.511-5.546), smoking (OR=2.991, CI=2.072- 4.317), chronic kidney disease (OR=2.296. CI=1.497- 3.521), and diabetes mellitus (OR=2.291, CI=1.714- 3.063) are predictors of ICU admission. Fatality ratio was 89/2084 (4.27%). Men were more prevalent in dead group. Conclusion(s): Coronavirus disease 2019 places a huge burden on healthcare facilities, particularly in patients with comorbidity. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who are obese and smokers with history of diabetes mellitus have a high risk of death.Copyright © 2020 Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

0	SARS-CoV2 virus and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). SARS-COV2 virus causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The novel coronavirus (2019) was discovered in 2019 in Wuhan, the market of the wet animal, China with viral pneumonia cases and is life-threatening. Today, WHO announces COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is likely to be zoonotic. It is transmitted from bats as intermediary animals to human. Also, the virus is transmitted from human to human who is in close contact with others. The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is nearly supportive; the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. The SARS-COV2 virus spreads faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatal-ity. In this article, we aimed to summarize the transmission, symptoms, patho-genesis, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine to control the spread of this fatal disease.Copyright © 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

0	Kidney transplantation using lymphocyte depleting induction and standard maintenance immunosuppression at the height of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in New York City: A single-center experience. Background: Concerns have been raised regarding proceeding with kidney transplantation using standard immunosuppression in COVID-19 endemic areas. Method(s): We performed a single-center review of all adult kidney transplants performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients were managed with standard immunosuppression protocols, including lymphocyte depleting induction and trough-guided tacrolimus. Retrospective data were collected for 3 months from the date of transplantation or until study conclusion (5/7/2020). The primary outcomes assessed included patient and allograft survival as well as COVID-19 related hospital readmission. Result(s): 30 kidney transplants were performed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a median follow-up of 51.5 days, 93.3% of patients were alive with 100% death-censored allograft survival. 9 patients were readmitted to the hospital during the study period, 4 (13.3%) related to infection with COVID-19. Infections were mild in 3/4 patients, with one patient developing severe disease leading to respiratory failure. Patients readmitted with COVID-19 were numerically more likely to be African American, have a BMI > 30 kg/m2, have a lymphocyte count <= 300 cells/mL, and be on maintenance corticosteroids. Conclusion(s): Kidney transplantation in areas endemic to COVID-19 using standard induction and maintenance immunosuppression appears to be associated with a modest risk for severe COVID-19 related disease.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

0	Planning of surgical activity in the COVID-19 era: A proposal for a step toward a possible healthcare organization. Health-care systems worldwide are experiencing a decline in elective surgical activity during the current COVID-19 pandemics. The progression of morbid conditions-especially of cancer-and the uncontained increase of waiting list for scheduled interventions are the major drawbacks. We propose a possible organization of a COVID-19 free hospital or hub, that include both patients' and workforce's preparation before entering the facility. The addition of a planned pathway for the whole workforce (physicians, nurses, cleaning and transporting crews, etc.) represents the basis of the program, and involves COVID-19 testing and subsequent self-isolation before entering the hospital, avoidance of work in non-COVID free areas, a strategic fractioning with a multilayer coverage system of care, periodic re-testing. Based on these suggestions, the realization of a COVID-19 free hospital could be achieved, allowing the continuation of a safe surgical activity in view of a possible restoration of non-urgent activity.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Predictive value of laboratory tests on severity of newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objective: To analyze the laboratory tests in newly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and their predictive values for the severity of the disease. Method(s): 83 patients, including 54 males and 29 females, with median interquartile range of 63(53-70)years diagnosed with covid-19 who were managed by Fujian medical team from January 27, 2020 to February 20, 2020 in Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital were studied retrospectively. According to the severity of the disease, they were divided into common, severe and critical groups. White blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYM), loctate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), serum ferritin (SF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and D-Dimer (D-D) on admission were analyzed retrospectively. And the predictive value of each indicator for critical group was analyzed by Logistic regression. Result(s): On admission, in common, severe and critical groups, WBC (x109/L) values were 7.10+/-3.88, 7.73+/-3.77 and 9.07+/-5.61, respectively (F = 1.315,P=0.274); IL-6 (mug/L) values were 11.76(9.42-15.18), 11.93(10.15-15.63) and 11.24(8.06-13.75), respectively(Z=0.591,P=0.744);D-D (mg/L) values were 0.70(0.48-1.12), 1.67(1.07-7.14) and 1.96(0.71-8.18), respectively(Z=3.363,P=0.186).There were no significant differences among three groups. On admission, in common, severe and critical groups, LYM(x109/L) values were 1.10+/-0.33, 0.80+/-0.35 and 0.66+/-0.32, respectively(F=11.415,P<0.001); SF(mug/L) values were 470.83+/-283.43, 835.66+/-819.43, and 1341.15+/-949.54, respectively (F=7.98,P=0.001); ESR(mm/h) values were 30.76+/-15.70, 42.55+/-22.51 and 51.04+/-25.09, respectively(F=5.181,P=0.008); LDH(U/L) values were 314.71+/-105.46, 325.69+/-109.85 and 444.03+/-181.07, respectively(F=7.17,P=0.001); hs-CRP(mug/L)values were 16(7.20-19.90), 31.00(20.00-87.60) and 80.50(33.70-113.00), respectively(Z=12.185,P=0.002);PCT(mug/L) values were 0.025(0.02-0.05), 0.05(0.02-0.13) and 0.09(0.05-0.39), respectively(Z=9.694,P=0.008). There were significant differences among three groups. Pairwise comparison showed that the LYM value in common group was higher than those in severe and critical groups, and the hs-CRP values in severe and critical groups were higher than that in common group,while SF, ESR, LDH and PCT values in critical group were all higher than those in severe and common groups(P<0.05). Conclusion(s): On admission, WBC, LYM, ESR and LDH are helpful to predict the severity of COVID-19. Although the level of IL-6 is increased, it may not be meaningful to judge the severity of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	Infection, screening, and psychological stress of health care workers with COVID-19 in a non-frontline clinical department. OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors and psychological stress of health care workers (HCWs) with COVID-19 in a non-frontline clinical department. METHOD(S): Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. RESULT(S): The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. 10 of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviours included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min +/- 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 days and 20.9 days to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). CONCLUSION(S): Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.	false
0	Food Insecurity in Tribal High Migration Communities in Rajasthan, India. BACKGROUND: The COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted food supplies across large parts of India, where even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition were widely prevalent. Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULT(S): A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION(S): The study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.	false
0	Optimized cell systems for the investigation of hepatitis C virus E1E2 glycoproteins. Great strides have been made in understanding and treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) thanks to the development of various experimental systems including cell-culture-proficient HCV, the HCV pseudoparticle system and soluble envelope glycoproteins. The HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) system is a platform used extensively in studies of cell entry, screening of novel entry inhibitors, assessing the phenotypes of clinically observed E1 and E2 glycoproteins and, most pertinently, in characterizing neutralizing antibody breadth induced upon vaccination and natural infection in patients. Nonetheless, some patient-derived clones produce pseudoparticles that are either non-infectious or exhibit infectivity too low for meaningful phenotyping. The mechanisms governing whether any particular clone produces infectious pseudoparticles are poorly understood. Here we show that endogenous expression of CD81, an HCV receptor and a cognate-binding partner of E2, in producer HEK 293T cells is detrimental to the infectivity of recovered HCVpp for most strains. Many HCVpp clones exhibited increased infectivity or had their infectivity rescued when they were produced in 293T cells CRISPR/Cas9 engineered to ablate CD81 expression (293TCD81KO). Clones made in 293TCD81KO cells were antigenically very similar to their matched counterparts made parental cells and appear to honour the accepted HCV entry pathway. Deletion of CD81 did not appreciably increase the recovered titres of soluble E2 (sE2). However, we did, unexpectedly, find that monomeric sE2 made in 293T cells and Freestyle 293-F (293-F) cells exhibit important differences. We found that 293-F-produced sE2 harbours mostly complex-type glycans whilst 293T-produced sE2 displays a heterogeneous mixture of both complex-type glycans and high-mannose or hybrid-type glycans. Moreover, sE2 produced in 293T cells is antigenically superior; exhibiting increased binding to conformational antibodies and the large extracellular loop of CD81. In summary, this work describes an optimal cell line for the production of HCVpp and reveals that sE2 made in 293T and 293-F cells are not antigenic equals. Our findings have implications for functional studies of E1E2 and the production of candidate immunogens.	false

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed health care inequities in the United States and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of individuals. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the ""new normal,"" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of health care delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19: characteristics and outcomes in the Cardio-COVID Italy multicenter study. Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been described in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) critically ill patients, but the evidence from more heterogeneous cohorts is limited. Method(s): Data were retrospectively obtained from consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 13 Cardiology Units in Italy, from March 1st to April 9th, 2020, and followed until in-hospital death, discharge, or April 23rd, 2020. The association of baseline variables with computed tomography-confirmed PE was investigated by Cox hazards regression analysis. The relationship between d-dimer levels and PE incidence was evaluated using restricted cubic splines models. Result(s): The study included 689 patients (67.3 +/- 13.2 year-old, 69.4% males), of whom 43.6% were non-invasively ventilated and 15.8% invasively. 52 (7.5%) had PE over 15 (9-24) days of follow-up. Compared with those without PE, these subjects had younger age, higher BMI, less often heart failure and chronic kidney disease, more severe cardio-pulmonary involvement, and higher admission d-dimer [4344 (1099-15,118) vs. 818.5 (417-1460) ng/mL, p < 0.001]. They also received more frequently darunavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab and ventilation support. Furthermore, they faced more bleeding episodes requiring transfusion (15.6% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001) and non-significantly higher in-hospital mortality (34.6% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.06). In multivariate regression, only d-dimer was associated with PE (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.62; p = 0.01). The relation between d-dimer concentrations and PE incidence was linear, without inflection point. Only two subjects had a baseline d-dimer < 500 ng/mL. Conclusion(s): PE occurs in a sizable proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The implications of bleeding events and the role of d-dimer in this population need to be clarified.

0	Diabetes and covid-19: A review. Diabetes is considered as one of the main comorbidities linked to the severity of respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. For people living with diabetes, even a minor illness can lead to dangerously high blood sugar levels. This may cause life-threatening complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state. Literature has been found that 20-50% affected patients of COVID-19 pandemic are diabetic. Diabetic patients are highly affected due to increased viral entry into the cell, decrease immunity. Here are several hypotheses to explain the increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes. Several cytokines are liberated in diabetics which can play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2, coronavirus pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology, potentially informing therapeutic choices in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Thus, knowledge about the potential mechanisms in between diabetes & the novel coronavirus is of utmost importance To managed diabetes, and individuals need to face challenges in the current trends in this pandemic crisis. For oral health professional, the management of diabetes should follow the protocol for the treatment of individuals with diabetes. This review illustrates the mechanisms by which diabetes modulates the host-viral interaction, hostimmune responses and guidelines to manage during an illness.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.	false
0	Association of poor housing conditions with COVID-19 incidence and mortality across US counties. OBJECTIVE: Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious disease spread. Since the relationship of poor housing conditions with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown, we investigated the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties., METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3135 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or greater of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling (with total population of each county as a denominator) was utilized to estimate relative risk of incidence and mortality related to poor housing conditions with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19 test density. We report incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality ratios (MRRs) for a 5% increase in prevalence in households with poor housing conditions., RESULTS: Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). On April 21st, the mean (SD) number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the adjusted models standardized by county population, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38-1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25-1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19.	false
0	Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for adjuvant treatment of a critically ill COVID-19 patient: A case report. Background: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has become a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, there are no satisfying antiviral medications and vaccines available. Case Presentation: We reported the treatment process and clinical outcome of a 48-year-old man critically ill COVID-19 patient who received transfusion of allogenic human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). Conclusion(s): We proposed that UC-MSC transfusion might be a new option for critically ill COVID-19. Although only one case we were shown, more similar clinical cases are inquired for further evidence providing the potential effectiveness of UC-MSC treatment.Copyright © 2020 Zhu et al.	false
0	In-hospital Care in Acute Heart Failure during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from the German-wide Helios Hospital Network. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in health care utilization for different acute cardiovascular diseases. Whether hospitalization rates and in-hospital mortality were affected by the pandemic in patients with acute symptomatic heart failure (HF) was investigated in this study. METHOD(S): Administrative data provided by 67 German Helios hospitals were examined for patients with main discharge diagnosis of HF using ICD-codes. Urgent hospital admissions per day were compared for a study period (March 13th-May 21th, 2020) with control intervals in 2020 (January 1st-March 12th) and 2019 (March 13th-May 21th), resulting in a total of 13484 patients excluding all patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression. Generalized linear mixed models were used for univariable and multivariable analysis to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULT(S): The number of admissions per day was lower in the study period compared to the same year (IRR 0.69, 95%CI 0.67-0.73, p<0.01) and the previous year control group (IRR 0.73, 95%CI 0.70-0.76, p<0.01). Age was similar throughout the intervals, but case-severity increased in terms of distribution within NYHA classes and comorbidities. Within the study period, 30-day rates for urgent hospital readmissions were higher compared to the same year but not the previous year control group. In-hospital mortality was 7.3% in the study period, 6.1% in the same year (p = 0.03) and 6.0% in the previous year control group (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, age, NYHA class and other predictors of fatal outcome were identified but hospitalization during study period was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION(S): Our data showed a significant reduction of urgent hospital admissions for HF with increased case-severity and concomitant in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Identifying causes of reduced inpatient treatment rates is essential for the understanding and valuation with regard to future optimal management of patients with HF.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Mean platelet volume/platelet count ratio predicts severe pneumonia of COVID-19. Background: Although platelet mean volume/platelet count ratio (MPR) is considered to be a crucial marker of inflammatory and infectious diseases, the relationship between MPR and novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 85 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into low and high MPR group. Data from repeated measures were compared by the generalized estimating equations. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of MPR on the incidence of severe pneumonia (SP), with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) used to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome is the incidence of SP of COVID-19. Result(s): During follow-up, 17 (20.0%) patients were developed to SP. Compared with mild patients, patients with SP developed showed a higher MPR level at baseline, day 1, day 2, and day 3 after admission (P =.005, P =.015, P =.009, and P =.032, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method showed a higher incidence of SP in the high MPR group than the low MPR group (log-rank test = 10.66, P =.001). After adjustment, high MPR was associated with an elevated incidence of SP (HR, 5.841, 95% CI, 1.566-21.791, P =.009). The IPTW method also suggested that MPR was a significant factor related to the incidence of SP (HR, 8.337, 95% CI, 4.045-17.182, P <.001). Conclusion(s): High MPR level is an independent risk factor for severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Anesthesia for Cardiac Surgery during COVID-19 Pandemic. The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with COVID-19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Healthcare workers, particularly anesthesiologists, are at increased risk since their airway management expertise is required in situations where suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 require surgical procedures and in critical care settings. Such patients undergoing surgery have a higher perioperative morbidity and mortality. Additionally, aerosol-generating procedures place the operating room staff at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection. Here, we present a review of COVID-19 management, particularly in the perioperative setting. In addition, this article highlights specific concerns with the use of transesophageal echocardiography and the precautions to be taken during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This review article is based on this institutional protocol supported by literature from recent publications and guidelines from major health organizations on COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Thieme India.

0	COVID-19 outbreaks: Global pandemic disaster (an overview). First step of corona virus in Wuhan, a city of China, in December 2019, spread throughout the world and becoming a global health emergency announced by World Health Organization and named as. ssRNA virus is highly infective and spread as through coughing or sneezing. By this time (23 April, 2020) more than 200 countries 175694 deaths are claim. The most common symptoms of COVID19 are fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (60%), myalgia (44%) and dyspnoea. The clinical features of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction. Several existing antiviral agents are being used under clinical trial. Only supportive therapy is the treatment strategy followed by health professionals. Supportive therapy includes administration of antipyretic and analgesic, maintenance of hydration, mechanical ventilation as respiratory support and uses of antibiotic in bacterial infections. In India, the status of COVID-19 is pathetic but strategically under control. Social distancing, proper hand hygiene and follows the instruction of Government of India, are helpful in spreading and controlling COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Global Research Online.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new zoonotic agent that emerged in December 2019, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the ""3 Cs,"" namely, ""closed spaces with poor ventilation,"" ""crowded spaces with many people,"" and ""close contact."" In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings as one of the initial political actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of indoor environmental quality control, especially ventilation."	false
0	Eye banking in the coronavirus disease 2019 era. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious; however, the different routes of transmission are not well understood. Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. This includes corneal transplantation, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in conjunctival swabs of infected patients, and the ocular surface may play an important role in viral entry. Several tissue transplantation organizations have guidelines in place regarding the screening of donors and tissue procurement procedures, including clinical and/or PCR screening of donors. The Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) is currently not recommending asymptomatic PCR screening. However, their antiseptic protocols may play an important role in viral inactivation. SUMMARY: Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low. However, tissue screening guidelines need to be re-evaluated regularly as knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves.	false
0	Reduced Self-Awareness Following a Combined Polar and Paramedian Bilateral Thalamic Infarction. A Possible Relationship With SARS-CoV-2 Risk of Contagion?. Reduced self-awareness is a well-known phenomenon investigated in patients with vascular disease; however, its impact on neuropsychological functions remains to be clarified. Importantly, selective vascular lesions provide an opportunity to investigate the key neuropsychological features of reduced self-awareness in neurocognitive disorders. Because of its rarity, we present an unusual case of a woman affected by a combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic infarction. The patient underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation to assess cognitive, behavioral, and functional domains, with a focus on executive functions. She was assessed clinically in the acute phase and after 6 months from the stroke, both clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient developed a cognitive impairment, characterised by prevalent executive dysfunction associated with reduced self-awareness and mood changes, in terms of apathy and depression. Such condition persisted after 6 months. In May 2020, the patient underwent the serology test in chemiluminescence to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The result of the quantitative test highlighted a high probability of previous contact with the virus. We suggest that reduced self-awareness related to executive dysfunction and behavioral changes may be due to combined polar and paramedian bilateral thalamic lesion. Metacognitive-executive dysfunction affecting the instrumental abilities of everyday life might make people less able to take appropriate precautions, facilitating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion.

0	Clinical presentation, case management and outcomes for the first 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Introduction: success in curtailing the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) depends largely on a sound understanding of the epidemiologic and clinical profile of cases in a population as well as the case management approach. This study documents the presenting characteristics, treatment modalities and outcomes of the first 32 COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Method(s): this retrospective study used medical records of the first 32 patients admitted and discharged from the Mainland Hospital, Lagos State, southwest Nigeria between February 27 and April 6, 2020. The outcomes of interest were death, promptness of admission process and duration of hospitalization. Result(s): the mean age of the patients was 38.1 years (SD: 15.5) and 66% were male. Three-quarters (75%) of the patients presented in moderately severe condition while 16% were asymptomatic. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (59%) and dry cough (44%). The mean time between a positive test result and admission was 1.63 days (SD: 1.31). Almost all (97%) the patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with no recorded death. The median duration of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR: 9-13.5). Conclusion(s): in this preliminary analysis of the first COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, clinical presentation was mild to moderate with no mortality. Processes to improve promptness of admission and reduce hospital stay are required to enhance the response to COVID-19 in Nigeria.Copyright © Abimbola Bowale et al.	false
0	Age-related differences in SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Northern Region of New Zealand. AIM: There is concern the low incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children reflects under-testing in this population. This study sought to describe the age-distribution of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Northern Region of New Zealand. METHOD(S): A retrospective single-centre review of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at LabPLUS, Auckland City Hospital, between 12 February and 18 April 2020. RESULT(S): A total of 22,333 tests were performed, with 313 (1.40%) positive results. The age-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 testing rate was three times higher in adults than in children. The overall proportion of positive tests was lower in children (0.86%) than adults (1.45%). However, within the paediatric population the proportion of tests positive differed significantly between those <10 years old (0.08%) and those 10-14 years old (2.6%). CONCLUSION(S): The lower proportion of tests positive in children <10 years of age suggests they are appropriately tested relative to their rates of disease. A large high school-associated cluster makes the higher proportion of tests positive in children 10-14 years old difficult to interpret. Older children may have a higher risk of infection and increasing testing in intermediate and high school aged children may be indicated.	false
0	Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 and Their Relationship with a Negative RT-PCR Result. This study was designed to examine maternal-perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) according to the result of a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and to investigate possible variables that could be useful for predicting a negative RT-PCR result. Participants of this retrospective cohort study were obstetrics patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent an RT-PCR test in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Maternal-perinatal features were analysed according to the results of this test. Clinical, radiological and analytical characteristics that could be associated with a negative result were also explored. In a final subgroup analysis, patients were included if they had pneumonia and a negative test result for the virus. Out of the 111 obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19 that were enrolled, 38.7% returned a negative result. In this RT-PCR-negative group, we recorded lower rates of pneumonia (21.4% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.009), severe or critical clinical features (4.7% vs. 11.8% and 0.0% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.02, respectively), lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (168 UI/L vs. 224.5 UI/L, p = 0.003), a greater need for maternal treatment (60.3% vs 24.4%, p < 0.001), a reduced need for oxygen therapy (2.4% vs 28.8%, p < 0.001) and a lower rate of intensive care unit admission (0.0% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.046) than the RT-PCR-positive group. While no differences were found in other variables, the monocyte count was higher (946.2/muL vs. 518.8/muL, p = 0.022) in this group. The predictive model for a negative test result included the monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy. This model was able to identify 73.5% of patients with a negative RT-PCR result. Only 11% of the patients with pneumonia testing negative for the virus had IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The proportion of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 and a negative RT-PCR result was nearly 39%. In these patients, the symptoms were mild and the systemic severity of the disease was lower. The monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy were the factors that were more related to a negative test result in this group. These variables could be used to guide the management of patients with suspected COVID-19, mainly while waiting for RT-PCR results or in settings where this test is not available.	false
0	Coronavirus disease 2019-COVID-19. In recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated pre-dominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	Routine slit lamp examination procedures: A risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection to eye care professionals. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious coronavirus, has been rapidly spreading after its surge in China in December 2019. It is currently a global pandemic. A myriad of transmission routes have been documented, however established thus far, are respiratory droplet, contact and airborne transmissions. Susceptible persons at proximity, usually within 1-2 m, to infected persons are largely at risk of being infected. Unfortunately, health workers usually evaluate patients within this distance. Eye care professionals (ECPs) are faced with a higher risk scenario of being infected as they undertake routine clinical eye examination procedures at a close face-to-face proximity to patients, which place them at a high risk of respiratory droplets and aerosolised particles, particularly from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers. The slit lamp examination procedure is typically at a distance of between 0.25 m and 0.5 m. While undertaking certain procedures on the slit lamp, such as gonioscopy and slit lamp indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ECP holds the accessory lenses either directly on the patient's eye or at about 5-10 cm from the patient's face, respectively. The authors found it pertinent to articulate this narrative review article to guide slit lamp examination practice by ECPs during routine ophthalmic evaluation, with a view to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to ECPs. In conclusion, ECPs are at increased risk of infection due to high-risk scenarios for routine slit lamp examination procedures of the eye. Adherence to standard precautionary measures with slit lamp use is highly recommended.	false
0	COVID-19 and multiple sclerosis: A description of two cases on alemtuzumab. Background: Alemtuzumab is a treatment for highly active multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunosuppression is considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is still lack of evidence to guide MS practice. Methods/results: We describe the clinical and immunological evolution of two MS patients under alemtuzumab treatment who were affected by COVID-19, one of them only one week after receiving her last dose, and both recovered without sequelae. Conclusion(s): In selected patients (young, without comorbidities, and with high activity), MS itself could be more dangerous than COVID-19, so we should consider continuing MS treatment as previously planned, including alemtuzumab.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Peptide modelling and screening against human ACE2 and spike glycoprotein RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a great challenge for scientific community globally. Virus enters cell through spike glycoprotein fusion with ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) human receptor. Hence, spike glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential target for diagnostics, vaccines, and antibodies. Also, virus entry can be prevented by blocking ACE2 thus, ACE2 can be considered potential target for therapeutics. As being highly specific, safe and efficacious, peptides hold their place in therapeutics. In present study, we retrieved sequence of 70 peptides from Antiviral Peptide Database (AVPdb), modelled them using 3D structure predicting web tool and docked them with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and human host receptor ACE2 using peptide-protein docking. It was observed that peptides have more affinity towards ACE2 in comparison with spike RBD. Interestingly it was noticed that most of the peptides bind to RBM (residue binding motif) which is responsible for ACE2 binding at the interface of RBD while, for ACE2, peptides prefer to bind the core cavity rather than RBD binding interface. To further investigate how peptides at the interface of RBD or ACE2 alter the binding between RBD and ACE2, protein-protein docking of RBD and ACE2 with and without peptides was performed. Peptides, AVP0671 at RBD and AVP1244 at ACE2 interfaces significantly reduce the binding affinity and change the orientation of RBD and ACE2 binding. This finding suggests that peptides can be used as a drug to inhibit virus entry in cells to stop COVID-19 pandemic in the future after experimental evidences.

0	Opportunities for biomaterials to address the challenges of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed major shortcomings in our ability to mitigate transmission of infectious viral disease and provide treatment to patients, resulting in a public health crisis. Within months of the first reported case in China, the virus has spread worldwide at an unprecedented rate. COVID-19 illustrates that the biomaterials community was engaged in significant research efforts against bacteria and fungi with relatively little effort devoted to viruses. Accordingly, biomaterials scientists and engineers will have to participate in multidisciplinary antiviral research over the coming years. Although tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have historically dominated the field of biomaterials, current research holds promise for providing transformative solutions to viral outbreaks. To facilitate collaboration, it is imperative to establish a mutual language and adequate understanding between clinicians, industry partners, and research scientists. In this article, clinical perspectives are shared to clearly define emerging healthcare needs that can be met by biomaterials solutions. Strategies and opportunities for novel biomaterials intervention spanning diagnostics, treatment strategies, vaccines, and virus-deactivating surface coatings are discussed. Ultimately this review serves as a call for the biomaterials community to become a leading contributor to the prevention and management of the current and future viral outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	"Newly Reported Studies on the Increase in Gastrointestinal Symptom Prevalence withCOVID-19 Infection: A Comprehensive Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although constitutional and respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever are the most common symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19, gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement has been observed by endoscopic biopsies. Multiple GI symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea or vomiting and abdominal pain, have also been reported. This review aims to present the currently available data regarding the GI symptoms of COVID-19 patients, and to compare the frequency of GI symptoms in early stage (Eastern) mostly Chinese data to the current stage (Western) non-Chinese data., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify both published studies by using PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI (Chinese medical search engine), and yet unpublished studies through medRxiv and bioRxiv. We also reviewed the cross references of the detected articles. We conducted a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search up until 20 September 2020. We pooled the prevalence of symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain by using the Freeman-Tukey's transforming random effect model., RESULTS: A total of 118 studies were included in the systematic review and 44 of them were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant heterogeneity between the studies; therefore, the random effects model was used. The pooled prevalence estimate of any GI symptoms reported was found to be 0.21 (95%CI, 0.16-0.27). Anorexia was the most commonly reported GI symptom at 18% (95%CI, 0.10-0.27) followed by diarrhea at 15% (95%CI, 0.12-0.19). Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and respiratory symptoms were more common in non-Chinese studies. The prevalence of abdominal pain was lower in the ""inpatient-only"" studies when compared with studies that included outpatients only and those including both inpatients and outpatients., CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study, we observed higher rates of diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain in COVID-19 infected patients among non-Chinese studies compared to Chinese studies. We also observed a higher prevalence of GI symptoms in Chinese studies than was reported previously. Non-respiratory symptoms, including GI tract symptoms, should be more thoroughly and carefully evaluated and reported in future studies."	false
0	Impact of the Family Environment on the Emotional State of Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Mediating Effect of Self-Efficacy. During the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the medical staff was facing severe work pressure, which led to a negative emotional state. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the family environment and the emotional state of the medical staff members during the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the importance of self-efficacy in regulating mental health, the mediating role of self-efficacy in the association between family environment and emotional state was also explored. A cross-sectional survey was performed, using an online questionnaire, on 645 medical staff who participated in the epidemic prevention and control tasks during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing. Family environment, self-efficacy, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were measured by the Family Environment Scale-Chinese Version (FES-CV), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Correlation analysis and mediating effect analysis were used to explore the relationships between them. First, a higher prevalence of anxiety (39%) and depressive (33%) symptoms were confirmed among the medical staff. Second, the symptoms of anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with the dimensions of cohesion and expressiveness and positively correlated with the dimensions of conflict in the FES-CV scale. Third, self-efficacy significantly mediated the association between the family environment and anxiety symptoms (P < 0.001) as well as the family environment and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). These findings show that a negative family environment was the main predictor of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we found that self-efficacy played a critical mediating role between the family environment and the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our study also indicates that improvements in the family environment benefit the mental health care of the medical staff, and high self-efficacy enhances this effect.

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged disrupting many socio-economical and healthcare aspects across the world. This virus can be transmitted by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals through saliva and contact. Due to its airborne transmission, aerosols created by natural activities and during dental treatment of infected individuals have become a potential vehicle of transmission and threat. The objective of this review was to assess the existing infection control measures taken in dental health-care settings and suggest modifications to reduce the transmission of novel coronavirus. This is a general review publication. Literature search was made at National Library of Medicine, Pubmed using key words such as ""dentistry and COVID"", ""dentistry and COVID and infection control"". Publications related to behaviour, education, ethics, treatment and childcare were excluded. Publications describing general aspects of infection control were reviewed. Keyword ""Dentistry and COVID and Infection control"" generated 70 publications which were reviewed. Infection control measures in dentistry are designed to minimise cross transmission mainly of blood borne pathogens. The unique nature of COVID-19 including highly infectious and transmissibility, and the ability to survive for a long time in the environment requires special attention and modification to the existing infection control measures which are highlighted here. In conclusion, a modified infection prevention and control (IPC) regime will protect the dental practitioner, assistant and staff, patients and the community. During the pandemic, drastic measures are necessary, however, during an endemic period measures can be remodified as necessary. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."	false
0	Knowledge, attitude and precautionary practices towards COVID-19 among healthcare professionals in Karachi, Pakistan. INTRODUCTION: With the increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19, healthcare professionals (HCPs) being at the frontline of the outbreak response are at higher risk of getting exposure and suffering from the infection. The present study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and precautionary practices of HCPs towards COVID-19., METHODOLOGY: The current study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, online study directed to the HCPs working in a metropolitan city of Karachi, during February 2020 and March 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire. A systematic random sampling approach was adopted., RESULTS: A total of 286 completed surveys were incorporated in the investigation with a response rate of 74.28%. The median (interquartile range, IQR) knowledge score was 18.79 (17.64-19.57). Physicians were found to be more knowledgeable (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.17-4.26, p = 0.003) as compared to other HCPs. Similarly, the HCPs working in private work settings (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.54-2.79, p=0.001), having more experience (OR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.78; p < 0.005) were found to be more well-informed than HCPs working in public sector (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.63-0.72; p = 0.004). The correlation between the knowledge and attitude of respondents was found to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient: 0.13, p < 0.005)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed that HCPs were well conversant and have an optimistic attitude towards COVID-19. Further contemplates are required to evaluate the understanding of HCPs at a national level so that viable mediations could be planned to combat this pandemic.

0	May 2020: Is It Always COVID-19 No Matter What?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a massive outbreak throughout the world. In this period, diseases other than coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not disappeared; however, it is hard for doctors to diagnose diseases that can mimic the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of COVID-19, especially rare lung diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). We report the clinical case of a young patient who presented to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and clinical symptoms, radiological aspects, and blood tests compatible with COVID-19; two swabs and a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 were performed, both resulted negative, but the respiratory failure worsened. Peripheral eosinophilia guided us to consider the possibility of a rare disease such as AEP, even if radiology findings were not pathognomonic. Therefore, we decided to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the lingula, which showed the presence of eosinophilia greater than 40%. As a consequence, we treated the patient with high-dose corticosteroids that completely resolved the respiratory symptoms. This case report highlights the difficulty of making alternative diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for rare lung diseases such as AEP, which may have initial characteristics similar to COVID-19.

0	A Retrospective Study of Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 11 Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia at a Single Center. BACKGROUND A lethal synergism between the influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified. However, bacterial coinfection is considered relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the co-prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae is low. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients subsequently admitted to AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020, with documented SARS-CoV-2 and S. pneumoniae coinfection. RESULTS We identified 11 patients with S. pneumoniae coinfection. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 74-82 years), 45.5% (5/11) were males, 54.5% (6/11) were white, and 90.9% (10/11) were long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR, 6-8 days). Among 11 patients, 4 were discharged in stable condition and 7 had died, resulting in an inpatient mortality rate of 64%. CONCLUSIONS At our center, 11 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection while in hospital. All patients had pneumonia confirmed on imaging and a nonspecific increase in markers of inflammation. The in-hospital mortality rate of 64% (7 patients) was higher in this group than in previous reports. This study highlights the importance of monitoring bacterial coinfection in patients with viral lung infection due to SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Pandemic vaccines: Promises and pitfalls. * Prototype vaccines against influenza A/H5N1 may be poorly immunogenic, and two or more doses may be required to induce levels of neutralising antibody that are deemed to be protective. The actual levels of antibody required to protect against a highly pathogenic virus that potentially can spread beyond the large airways is unknown. * The global capacity for vaccine manufacture in eggs or tissue culture is considerable, but the number of doses that can theoretically be produced in a pandemic context will only be sufficient for a small fraction of the world's population, even less if a high antigen content is required. * The safety of new pandemic vaccines should be addressed in an internationally coordinated way. * Steps are underway through the Therapeutic Goods Administration to evaluate mock-up vaccines now, so that the time to registration of a new product can be minimised. * It will be 3-6 months into the pandemic before an effective vaccine becomes available, so other control measures will be important in the early stages of a pandemic. * The primary goal of a pandemic influenza vaccine must be to prevent death, and not necessarily to prevent infection.	false
0	Parenting-Related Exhaustion During the Italian COVID-19 Lockdown. OBJECTIVE: Worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated significant worry, uncertainty, anxiety, sadness, and loneliness. In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion-and to identify its associated risk and protective factors-4weeks into the lockdown. METHOD(S): A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. RESULT(S): Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. CONCLUSION(S): The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and social workers should be warned of the effects of lockdown and social distancing on parenting and, consequently, the well-being of children.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Sex differences in clinical phenotype and transitions of care among individuals dying of COVID-19 in Italy. BACKGROUND: Among the unknowns posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the role of biological sex to explain disease susceptibility and progression is still a matter of debate, with limited sex-disaggregated data available. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis was performed to assess if sex differences exist in the clinical manifestations and transitions of care among hospitalized individuals dying with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy (February 27-June 11, 2020). Clinical characteristics and the times from symptoms' onset to admission, nasopharyngeal swab, and death were compared between sexes. Adjusted multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinical features associated with male sex. RESULT(S): Of the 32,938 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Italy, 3517 hospitalized and deceased individuals with COVID-19 (mean 78 +/- 12years, 33% women) were analyzed. At admission, men had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (adj-OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.23), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adj-OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.29-2.27), and chronic kidney disease (adj-OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.96), while women were older and more likely to have dementia (adj-OR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.95) and autoimmune diseases (adj-OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), yet both sexes had a high level of multimorbidity. The times from symptoms' onset to admission and nasopharyngeal swab were slightly longer in men despite a typical acute respiratory illness with more frequent fever at the onset. Men received more often experimental therapy (adj-OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.45-5.74) and experienced more likely acute kidney injury (adj-OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.90). CONCLUSION(S): Men and women dying with COVID-19 had different clinical manifestations and transitions of care. Identifying sex-specific features in individuals with COVID-19 and fatal outcome might inform preventive strategies.	false

0	Household clustering of SARS-CoV-2 in community settings: A study from rural ecuador. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is now expanding into the developing world with devastating consequences. Departing from a population-based study in rural Ecuador where all adult individuals (aged 40 years or older) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, we expanded it to include a house-based case-control component assessing in-house clustering and other variables potentially associated with infection. We selected houses where exactly two study participants lived and were both seropositive (case-houses), and matched 1:1 to control-houses where both were seronegative. Younger household members had an antibody test performed. Infected household members were found in 33 (92%) case-houses and in only six (17%) control-houses. In 28/29 discordant house pairs, the case-house had seropositive household members and the control-house did not (odds ratio: 28; 95% CI: 4.6-1,144). Our data demonstrate strong in-house clustering of infection in community settings, stressing the importance of early case ascertainment and isolation for SARS-CoV-2 control.Copyright © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients: Humoral versus cell-mediated immunity. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed unprecedented pressure on various healthcare systems, including departments that use immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and immunosuppression therapy in organ transplantation units. The true impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on immunocompromised CAR T-cell therapy recipients and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) has not yet been established. Case presentation In this report, we compare two patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in either the humoral or cell-mediated immunodeficient states. The first patient was a man in his early 30s who was diagnosed with refractory multiple myeloma. He received fully humanized, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, CAR T-cell therapy before 4 months and achieved strict complete remission. He was infected with SARS-CoV-2 starting on January 26, 2019 and gradually progressed to severe pneumonia. Throughout the clinical progression of the disease, SARS-CoV-2 could not be cleared due to his humoral immunodeficient state. During this period of his severe COVID-19 pneumonia, elevated cytotoxic T-cells were observed in this patient's peripheral blood while elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and ferritin were observed in his cytokine profiles. This patient eventually progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome and recieved non-invasive ventilatory support. He failed to generate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and died of respiratory failure on day 33 (d33). The second patient was a 52-year-old kidney transplant recipient (KTR) who took ciclosporin after renal transplantation for more than 7 years. He confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on January 20, 2019 and gradually progressed into severe pneumonia on d16 with a slightly elevated B-cell percentage and normal T-lymphocyte subsets. Viral clearance occurred together with the generation of specific anti-immunoglobulin G-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 2 weeks of treatment. He was symptom-free and discharged from the hospital on d42. Conclusion We report a CAR T-cell therapy recipient diagnosed with COVID-19 for the first time. His virus clearance failure and life-threating cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that any decision to proceed CAR T-cell therapy during COVID-19 pandemics will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Immunosuppressant treatment based on ciclosporin could be relatively safe for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.

0	Impact of hydrological factors on the dynamic of COVID-19 epidemic: A multi-region study in China. Considering the live SARS-CoV-2 was detected and isolated from the excrement and urine of infected patients, the potential public health risk of its waterborne transmission should be paid broad and close attention. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the associations between COVID-19 incidences and hydrological factors such as lake area, river length, precipitation and volume of water resources in 30 regions of China. All confirmed cases for each areas were divided into two clusters including first cases cluster driven by imported cases during the period of January 20th to January 29th, 2020 and second cases cluster driven by local cases during the period of January 30th to March 1st, 2020. Based on the results of descriptive analysis and nonlinear regression analysis, positive associations with COVID-19 confirmed numbers were observed for migration scale index (MSI), river length, precipitation and volume of water resources, but negative associations for population density. The correlation coefficient in the second stage cases cluster is apparently higher than that in the first stage cases cluster. Then, the negative binomial-generalized linear model (NB-GLM) was fitted to estimate area-specific effects of hydrological variables on relative risk (RR) with the incorporation of additional variables (e.g., MSI) and the effects of exposure-lag-response. The statistically significant associations between RR and river length, the volume of water resources, precipitation were obtained by meta-analysis as 1.24 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.27), 2.56 (95% CI: 2.50, 2.61) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.56, 1.62), respectively. The possible water transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential capacity of long-distance transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in water environment was also discussed. Our results could provide a better guidance for local and global authorities to broaden the mind for understanding the natural-social system or intervening measures for COVID-19 control at the current or futural stage.

0	Deficiency of Tfh Cells and Germinal Center in Deceased COVID-19 Patients. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 is characterized by a remarkable variation in clinical severity ranging from a mild illness to a fatal multi-organ disease. Understanding the dysregulated human immune responses in the fatal subjects is critical for management of COVID-19 patients and the pandemic. In this study, we examined the immune cell compositions in the lung tissues and hilar lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry on 6 deceased COVID-19 patients and 4 focal organizing pneumonia (FOP) patients who underwent lung surgery and served as controls. We found a dominant presence of macrophages and a general deficiency of T cells and B cells in the lung tissues from deceased COVID-19 patients. In contrast to the FOP patients, Tfh cells and germinal center formation were largely absent in the draining hilar lymph nodes in the deceased COVID-19 patients. This was correlated with reduced IgM and IgG levels compared to convalescent COVID-19 patients. In summary, our data highlight a defect of germinal center structure in deceased COVID-19 patients leading to an impaired humoral immunity. Understanding the mechanisms of this deficiency will be one of the key points for the management of this epidemic.	false
0	Pharmacological and non-pharmacological efforts at prevention, mitigation, and treatment for COVID-19. A global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people over a short period of time. The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritised development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomised controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities. This review discusses pharmacological interventions at play and evidence-based successes and limitations of non-pharmacological therapies such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, and ventilator support associated with the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	false
0	Selection, biophysical and structural analysis of synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies constitute a key short-to-medium term approach to tackle COVID-19. However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC50 of 0.6 microg/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed an unusual conformation of the spike where two RBDs are in the 'up' ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly emerging viruses.	false

0	[Audiological profile of patients with SARS-Co-V-2 PCR-positive cases]. COVID-19 is a new pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 11 February 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients may vary, more often include symptoms affected by upper and lower respiratory tract damage. In ENT practice it is used to mention rhinitis, sore throat, anosmia/hyposmia. The effect of COVID-19 is an interesting issue in audiology. There were 78 patients who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 PCR-positive cases and 30 normal non-infected subjects in our study. The patients were divided into two groups according to severity their clinical symptoms from asymptomatic COVID-19 PCR-positive cases to severe form. All patients underwent audiological evaluation included tympanometry, acoustic threshold and transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE). Although hearing sensitivity was normal among some participants, it was statistically proved that TEOAEs could pick up subtle deterioration in the outer hair cells functions and impact on the cochlear.	false

0	Salivary diagnostics of the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). INTRODUCTION: Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus and the consequent respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is categorized in methods that detect the viral presence and methods that detect antibodies produced in the host as a response to infection. Methods that detect viral presence into the host excretions measure current infection by SARS-CoV-2 whereas the detection of human antibodies exploited against SARS-CoV-2 evaluates the past exposure to the virus., OBJECTIVE: This review provides a comprehensive overview for the use of saliva as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the methods for the salivary diagnostics utilized till very recently and the arisen considerations for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease., CONCLUSION: The major advantage of using saliva as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is that saliva collection is a noninvasive method which produces no discomfort to the patient and permits to the patients home self-sampling techniques in order to protect health providers from the exposure to the pathogen. There is an urgent need to increase the active research for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva because the non-invasive salivary diagnostics may provide a reliable and cost-effective method suitable for the fast and early detection of COVID-19 infection.

0	Aetiology of viral gastroenteritis. A review. Over the past seven to eight years, several virus groups have been shown to be associated with gastroenteritis. They are adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, Norwalk-like viruses and rotaviruses. In infants and young children, rotaviruses are the single most important aetiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in terms of numbers of cases and also of patients requiring admission to hospital. In older children and adults, the aetiology is less clear, but the present state of our knowledge indicates that Norwalk-like viruses are one of the major causes. Most of these gastroenteritis-producing viruses cannot be propagated satisfactorily in laboratory cell-culture systems, and electron microscopy is the chief method of detection. Immune electron microscopy is used to demonstrate specific antibody increases during infection and to show antigenic differences between morphologically similar viruses. These techniques are relatively insensitive, and the development of a cell-culture system for the propagation of these 'gastroenteritis viruses' vuryses' would greatly facilitate epidemiological studies and vaccine development.	false
0	Differences in terms of presentation and outcomes between patients with lung cancer as opposed to other solid organ cancer after infection with SARS-CoV-2: protocol for a systematic review. INTRODUCTION: Scholars believe that COVID-19 can be particularly lethal for patients with cancer. Some studies found that COVID-19 appears to be more lethal in patients with lung cancer than in other cancer patients. In order to take appropriate measures to balance a delay in lung cancer treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, we first need to know whether patients with lung cancer have special risks. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine differences in terms of presentation and outcomes between patients with lung cancer as opposed to other solid organ cancer after infection with SARS-CoV-2., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of published original research studies will be performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, WangFangData, CQVIP, COMPENDEX and CNKI. The medRxiv preprint server will also be searched for applicable studies (grey literature). Original research studies will be included if they include patients with: (A) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and (B) confirmed solid cancer, and (C) measurable clinical presentation or outcome, such as mortality rate, intensive care unit admission rate, incidence of pneumonia. One author will conduct the electronic database searches, two authors will independently screen studies, two will extract data and two will assess study quality. If I2 exceeds 60% for the pooled analysis, we will explore sources of heterogeneity in subgroups of studies. We will use fixed-effect, random-effects or mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk or OR. If the data reporting allows, a subgroup analysis between non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer patients will be performed., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The proposed study will not collect individual-level data and, therefore, does not require ethical approval. We will submit our findings to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and will disseminate results through presentations at international scientific conferences., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020190118.

0	"Comparative study on formation of protein coronas under three different serum origins. Nanomaterials form a complex called ""protein corona"" by contacting with protein-containing biological fluids such as serum when they are exposed to physiological environments. The characteristics of these proteins, which are one of the substantial factors in cellular response, are affected by the interactions between the nanomaterials and the biological systems. Many studies have investigated the biological behaviors of nanomaterials by conducting experiments in vitro and in vivo; however, the origin of the biological materials used is rather inconsistent. This is due to the fact that the composition of the protein coronas may differ depending on the animal origin, not on the composition or size of the nanoparticles. The resulting differences in the composition of the protein coronas can lead to different conclusions. To identify the differences in protein corona formation among sera of different species, we investigated protein coronas of gold and silica nanoparticles in serum obtained from various species. Using comparative proteomic analysis, common proteins adsorbed onto each nanoparticle among the three different sera were identified as highly abundant proteins in the serum. These findings indicate that protein corona formation is dependent on the serum population rather than the size or type of the nanoparticles. Additionally, in the physiological classification of protein coronas, human serum (HS) was found to be rich in apolipoproteins. In conclusion, our data indicate that HS components are different from those of bovine or mouse, indicating that the serum species origin should be carefully considered when selecting a biological fluid."	false
0	Assessing the Impact of Neighborhood Socioeconomic Characteristics on COVID-19 Prevalence Across Seven States in the United States. Introduction:The spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the United States has highlighted the long-standing nationwide health inequalities with socioeconomically challenged communities experiencing a higher burden of the disease. We assessed the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics on the COVID-19 prevalence across seven selected states (i.e., Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia). Methods:We obtained cumulative COVID-19 cases reported at the neighborhood aggregation level by Departments of Health in selected states on two dates (May 3rd, 2020, and May 30th, 2020) and assessed the correlation between the COVID-19 prevalence and neighborhood characteristics. We developed Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite measure to rank neighborhoods by their socioeconomic characteristics, using the 2018 US Census American Community Survey. The higher ADI rank represented more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results:After controlling for age, gender, and the square mileage of each community we identified Zip-codes with higher ADI (more disadvantaged neighborhoods) in Illinois and Maryland had higher COVID-19 prevalence comparing to zip-codes across the country and in the same state with lower ADI (less disadvantaged neighborhoods) using data on May 3rd. We detected the same pattern across all states except for Florida and Virginia using data on May 30th, 2020. Conclusion:Our study provides evidence that not all Americans are at equal risk for COVID-19. Socioeconomic characteristics of communities appear to be associated with their COVID-19 susceptibility, at least among those study states with high rates of disease.	false

0	COVID-19 Care in India: Evolving Paradigms from Public Health to Critical Care. Covid-19 pandemic in India has rapidly grown though we have a low case fatality rate, high recovery rate and large population is asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Public health measures to close the tap across the country need hypervigilance and follow simple dictum of aggressive testing, tracing and isolation. The covid cases need an early diagnosis with treat and care model. Most can be managed with home isolation under telemedicine supervision with oxygen saturation screening by a simple six minute walk test. Hospitalised cases have emerging evidence in different therapies from antivirals, steroids, immunologic to heparins but high flow oxygen, prone position and supportive care remains the cornerstone in critical care with nursing and nutrition. Vaccine research is ongoing but currently only social vaccine can mitigate the pandemic. Covid appropriate behaviour of Masking, sanitisation and physical distancing with immune modulating behaviour like adequate sleep, digital detox for two hour and clean well ventilated environment is the key with breathing exercises including yoga and positive mental health and avoidance of crowds the only vaccine to live with covid -19 today.

0	Liver Transplantation in a Patient after COVID-19 - rapid loss of antibodies and prolonged Viral RNA Shedding. To date, little is known about the duration and effectiveness of immunity as well as possible adverse late effects after an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus it is unclear, when and if liver transplantation can be safely offered to patients that suffered from COVID-19. Here, we report on a successful liver transplantation shortly after convalescence from COVID-19 with subsequent partial seroreversion as well as recurrence and prolonged shedding of viral RNA.

0	The potential epidemiological impact of COVID-19 on the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the cost-effectiveness of linked, opt-out HIV testing: A modeling study in six US cities. BACKGROUND: Widespread viral and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 may present a unique opportunity to also test for HIV infection. We estimated the potential impact of adding linked, opt-out HIV testing alongside SARS-CoV-2 testing on HIV incidence and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in six US cities., METHODS: Using a previously-calibrated dynamic HIV transmission model, we constructed three sets of scenarios for each city: (1) sustained current levels of HIV-related treatment and prevention services (status quo); (2) temporary disruptions in health services and changes in sexual and injection risk behaviours at discrete levels between 0%-50%; and (3) linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing offered to 10%-90% of the adult population in addition to scenario (2). We estimated cumulative HIV infections between 2020-2025 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of linked HIV testing over 20 years., RESULTS: In the absence of linked, opt-out HIV testing, we estimated a total of 16.5% decrease in HIV infections between 2020-2025 in the best-case scenario (50% reduction in risk behaviours and no service disruptions), and 9.0% increase in the worst-case scenario (no behavioural change and 50% reduction in service access). We estimated that HIV testing (offered at 10%-90% levels) could avert a total of 576-7,225 (1.6%-17.2%) new infections. The intervention would require an initial investment of $20.6M-$220.7M across cities; however, the intervention would ultimately result in savings in health care costs in each city., CONCLUSIONS: A campaign in which HIV testing is linked with SARS-CoV-2 testing could substantially reduce HIV incidence and reduce direct and indirect health care costs attributable to HIV.

0	Case Report: Canakinumab for the Treatment of a Patient With COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Severe cases of COVID-19 present with serious lung inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with high cytokine levels, including interleukin-6 and certain subsets of immune cells, in particular, NK, distinguished according to the cell surface density of CD56. Cytokine levels are inversely correlated with lymphocyte count, therefore cytokine release syndrome may be an impediment to the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1beta is under investigation for the treatment of severe SAR-CoV-2 infection. An 85 year old male presenting in our hospital with COVID-19, whose condition was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiac and renal failure (with oliguria) after 25 days of hospitalization, was intubated and received canakinumab for compassionate use. On the next day, diuresis recovered and conditions improved: high IL-6 levels and NK cells expressing CD56 bright (associated with cytokine relase) were significantly reduced giving rise to NK CD56 dim . Patient died on day 58 with pulmonary bacterial superinfection and persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. In conclusion, canakinumab rescued a high risk, very elderly patient, from multiorgan damage complicating COVID-19. It may represent an useful treatment in severe cases.

0	Analysis of Co-inhibitory Receptor Expression in COVID-19 Infection Compared to Acute Plasmodium falciparum Malaria: LAG-3 and TIM-3 Correlate With T Cell Activation and Course of Disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is a severe flu-like illness which is associated with hyperinflammation and immune dysfunction. The virus induces a strong T and B cell response but little is known about the immune pathology of this viral infection. Acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria also causes acute clinical illness and is characterized by hyperinflammation due to the strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a massive activation of T cells. In malaria, T cells express a variety of co-inhibitory receptors which might be a consequence of their activation but also might limit their overwhelming function. Thus, T cells are implicated in protection as well as in pathology. The outcome of malaria is thought to be a consequence of the balance between co-activation and co-inhibition of T cells. Following the hypothesis that T cells in COVID-19 might have a similar, dual function, we comprehensively characterized the differentiation (CCR7, CD45RO) and activation status (HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, CD226), the co-expression of co-inhibitory molecules (PD1, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, TIGIT), as well as the expression pattern of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells of PBMC of n = 20 SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to n = 10 P. falciparum infected patients and n = 13 healthy controls. Overall, acute COVID-19 and malaria infection resulted in a comparably elevated activation and altered differentiation status of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations. T effector cells of COVID-19 and malaria patients showed higher frequencies of the inhibitory receptors T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) which was linked to increased activation levels and an upregulation of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes. COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease course showed higher levels of LAG-3 and TIM-3 than patients with a mild disease course. During recovery, a rapid normalization of these inhibitory receptors could be observed. In summary, comparing the expression of different co-inhibitory molecules in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in COVID-19 vs. malaria, there is a transient increase of the expression of certain inhibitory receptors like LAG-3 and TIM-3 in COVID-19 in the overall context of acute immune activation.

0	Proposal of research model for the detection of COVID-19 among asymptomatic carriers. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic and rapidly progressing infectious disease that represents a global health care emergency due to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Rapid tests detect antigen or antibody presence, which is useful for patient care and for assisting in disease surveillance and epidemiological research. The complicating aspect of the COVID-19 spread may be due to asymptomatic individuals. Unfortunately, asymptomatic individuals are not detected in the early stages of infection, which could help to prevent community spread. The present paper shares an opinion through the proposal of a research model for detecting COVID-19 among asymptomatic carriers.Copyright © 2020 by Thieme Revinter Publicacoes Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	false
0	Correlation between hyponatremia and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019. Objective To investigate the correlation between hyponatremia and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Clinical data of 12 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shantou Central Hospital from January 23 to February 5 in 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including gender, age, symptoms, lab test and clinical outcomes, to analyze the change trend of blood Na+ level in the patients with COVID-19. Results Among the 12 patients with COVID-19, there were 8 males and 4 females with the mean age of (38.0+/-16.3) years old, most of them were admitted to the hospital with cough and/or fever. All patients had a positive nucleic acid test for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and were discharged after clinical treatment with oxygen therapy, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and nutritional support. All patients were of ordinary type when they were admitted to the hospital. Among them, 1 patient turned into a severe case during the course of the disease, and 1 patient showed a tendency to become severe case. It was found that 10 patients without severe conversion had an average blood Na+ of (138.3+/-1.3) mmol/L at admission, and the lowest blood Na+ during the course of disease was (135.9+/-3.1) mmol/L. However, 2 patients who became severe and had a tendency to become severe disease (Na+ levels at admission were 140.0 mmol/L and 138.0 mmol/L, respectively) experienced hyponatremia during the course of the disease (the lowest blood Na+ levels were 129.0 mmol/L and 122.0 mmol/L). Further analysis showed that the lower serum Na+ level, the higher level of white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but serum Na+ level was consistent with the change trend of lymphocytes, suggesting that hyponatremia was closely correlated with severe inflammation reaction. Conclusions Serum Na+ showed decreasing tendency during the development of COVID-19, and hyponatremia was closely related to the severity of COVID-19. It was necessary to pay great attention to the change trend of blood Na+ level. However, further research was needed to obtain more reliable conclusions and explorer the pathophysiological mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is the worldwide challenge. The virus is highly contagious, and clinical consequences were very divers. It is estimated that if no effective action is taken, COVID-19 could plague 90% of the world's population and kill over 40 million people. So, it is essential to understand the virus pathogenicity and follow the preventive methods to control the high morbidity and mortality rates. Meanwhile our current knowledge of COVID-19 is still limited, despite hard efforts of scientists and clinicians during last few months. In this review article, we have collected the latest data about characteristics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false

0	Clinical Presentation, Management and In-Hospital Outcome of Healthcare Personnel With COVID-19 Disease. Objective Healthcare personnel (HCP) are undoubtedly one of the major frontline fighters in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that many HCP have become infected by COVID-19 globally. The infection of HCP has received great attention in social media and is frequently reported from different parts of the world. However, there are few scientific reports addressing this aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of COVID-19 infection among the HCP of our setting. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed in the National Heart Foundation Hospital & Research Institute of Bangladesh from April 29 to July 20, 2020. HCP employed in this hospital who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms or came in close contact with COVID-19 patients at home or their workplace were included in this study. The presence of COVID-19 disease was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 394 HCP were sampled and 139 had a positive corona test. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCP with confirmed COVID-19. Data analysis was performed in July 2020. Results Out of 1,409 HCP, 139 subjects tested positive for COVID-19. Among the HCP, infection rate was 9.86%. The mean age of the study population was 34.08+/-11.11 years (range: 20-69 yrs), of whom 82 (59%) were female. Most of this cohort were nurses (56 [40.3%]) and physicians (25 [18%]), and the remaining 58 (41.7%) were other staff. The mean duration of onset of symptoms to test was 2.89+/-2.07 days. The most common symptoms were fever (84.2%), fatigue (56.1%), cough (54%), body ache (39.6%), headache, and anosmia (38.8%). Most subjects had mild disease (125 [93%]), three (2.1%) of the HCP had moderate disease and one (0.7%) had severe disease. Ten of the HCP (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Most of them were treated either by ivermectin plus azithromycin or ivermectin plus doxycycline. Only 20 (14.4%) of the HCP were hospitalized, while others were treated either in home isolation (59.7%) or in institutional isolation (25.9%). Recovery was almost uneventful except one healthcare worker who died. Conclusion Most HCP had mild symptoms and a few of them were asymptomatic also. HCP with mild COVID-19 symptoms may be treated in home or institutional isolation. As they are a vulnerable group for infection, providing adequate protection to HCP is absolutely mandatory to safeguard them from this pandemic. Copyright © 2020, Malik et al.	false
0	Enhanced elicitation of potent neutralizing antibodies by the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain Fc fusion protein in mice. The development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We generated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc fusion protein and evaluated its potency to elicit neutralizing antibody response in mice. RBD-Fc elicited a higher neutralizing antibodies titer than RBD as evaluated by a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a live virus based microneutralization assay. Furthermore, RBD-Fc immunized sera better inhibited cell-cell fusion, as evaluated by a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay. The cell-cell fusion assay results correlated well with the virus neutralization potency and could be used for high-throughput screening of large panels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and vaccines without the requirement of live virus infection in BSL3 containment. Moreover, the anti-RBD sera did not enhance the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection of K562 cells. These results demonstrate that Fc fusion can significantly improve the humoral immune response to recombinant RBD immunogen, and suggest that RBD-Fc could serve as a useful component of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and enhanced innate immune gene expression in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats. OBJECTIVE: An enigmatic epidemiological feature of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the high rate of asymptomatic infection in pregnant women.1 This is puzzling because systemic immune changes predispose pregnant women to increased severity of respiratory viral infections, especially influenza A.2 A major roadblock in understanding this atypical clinical presentation is the poor characterization of cellular entry factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the androgen-sensitive transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) - in the respiratory tract during pregnancy. Motivated by a recent report showing estradiol-mediated downregulation of ACE2 in the airway epithelium,3 we hypothesized that the hormonal changes of pregnancy will decrease the expression of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry factors. Here, we compare their expression and examine the innate immune system in the nasal epithelium of term pregnant (gestational day 20) vs. non-pregnant 2-month old female rats STUDY DESIGN: All experiments were conducted after appropriate institutional approval (protocol ID:19-1071) and comply with ARRIVE guidelines. Briefly, nasal epithelia from euthanized rats (n=9 each) were dissected according to the protocol described by Dunston et al. with modifications.4 Collected samples were assayed for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (Ace2, Tmprss2), innate antiviral immune genes that are highly co-expressed with Ace2 (Tnfsf10, Mx1, Nos2),5 and genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 detection and defense (Rig-1, Tlr7, MyD88, Irf7) with TaqMan qPCR (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.). In addition, we determined the expression of ACE2 (LS-c763699, LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc.; 1:1000 dilution) and TMPRSS2 (sc-515727, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:250 dilution) protein with immunoblots. Finally, we assayed ACE2 enzyme activity with a fluorometric assay (K897-100, Biovision Inc.)., RESULTS: We observed a marked downregulation of the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 genes (Fig 1A) along with concomitant changes in protein expression (1B), and a significant decrease in ACE2 enzyme activity in the nasal epithelium during pregnancy (1C). Innate immune genes with antiviral function that are highly co-expressed with Ace2 (Tnfsf10, Mx1, Nos2) were significantly elevated in the nasal epithelium from pregnant rats (1D). Similarly, the expression of cytoplasmic (Rig-1) and endosomal viral sensors (Tlr7, MyD88, and Irf7) involved in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were substantially upregulated with pregnancy (1E). Collectively, our results show a decrease in cell entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 and a surprisingly robust expression of innate immune response genes in the nasal epithelium of pregnant rats., CONCLUSION: Based on our preclinical findings, we surmise that the high rate of asymptomatic infection in pregnant women is likely due to decreased SARS-CoV-2 tropism secondary to reduced expression of cell entry factors. Our observation of upregulated innate immune defense in the nasal epithelium, in contrast to the immunological indolence at the placental-fetal interface, was unexpected and novel. Considering the exquisite vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza A virus, another single-stranded RNA virus, but not SARS-CoV-2, our findings set the stage for comprehensive characterization of respiratory mucosal immunology in pregnant women to better understand host-pathogen interaction in this unique demographic subset.

0	Pooling for SARS-CoV-2 control in care institutions. BACKGROUND: Workers and residents in Care Homes are considered at special risk for the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to the infectivity and high mortality rate in the case of residents, compared to other containment areas. The role of presymptomatic people in transmission has been shown to be important and the early detection of these people is critical for the control of new outbreaks. Pooling strategies have proven to preserve SARS-CoV-2 testing resources. The aims of the present study, based in our local experience, were (a) to describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in institutionalized people in Galicia (Spain) during the Coronavirus pandemic and (b) to evaluate the expected performance of a pooling strategy using RT-PCR for the next rounds of screening of institutionalized people., METHODS: A total of 25,386 Nasopharyngeal swab samples from the total of the residents and workers at Care Homes in Galicia (March to May 2020) were individually tested using RT-PCR. Prevalence and quantification cycle (Cq) value distribution of positives was calculated. Besides, 26 pools of 20 samples and 14 pools of 5 samples were tested using RT-PCR as well (1 positive/pool). Pooling proof of concept was performed in two populations with 1.7 and 2% prevalence., RESULTS: Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection at Care Homes was uneven (0-60%). As the virus circulation global rate was low in our area (3.32%), the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continues to be very high. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated that pooling of different groups of samples at low prevalence clusters, can be done with a small average delay on Cq values (5 and 2.85 cycles for pools of 20 and 5 samples, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: A new screening system with guaranteed protection is required for small clusters, previously covered with individual testing. Our proposal for Care Homes, once prevalence zero is achieved, would include successive rounds of testing using a pooling solution for transmission control preserving testing resources. Scale-up of this method may be of utility to confront larger clusters to avoid the viral circulation and keeping them operative.	false
0	Blood purification therapy with a hemodiafilter featuring enhanced adsorptive properties for cytokine removal in patients presenting COVID-19: a pilot study. BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation in COVID-19 often leads to multiple organ failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in combination with sequential extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBP) might support renal function, attenuate systemic inflammation, and prevent or mitigate multiple organ dysfunctions in COVID-19., AIM: Describe overtime variations of clinical and biochemical features of critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated with EBP with a hemodiafilter characterized by enhanced cytokine adsorption properties., METHODS: An observational prospective study assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (February to April 2020) treated with EBP according to local practice. Main endpoints included overtime variation of IL-6 and multiorgan function-scores, mortality, and occurrence of technical complications or adverse events., RESULTS: The study evaluated 37 patients. Median baseline IL-6 was 1230 pg/ml (IQR 895) and decreased overtime (p < 0.001 Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 24 h (p = 0.001). The reduction in serum IL-6 concentrations correlated with the improvement in organ function, as measured in the decrease of SOFA score (rho = 0.48, p = 0.0003). Median baseline SOFA was 13 (IQR 6) and decreased significantly overtime (p < 0.001 at Kruskal-Wallis test) during the first 72 h of the treatment, with the most significant decrease in the first 48 h (median 8 IQR 5, p = 0.001). Compared to the expected mortality rates, as calculated by APACHE IV, the mean observed rates were 8.3% lower after treatment. The best improvement in mortality rate was observed in patients receiving EBP early on during the ICU stay. Premature clotting (running < 24 h) occurred in patients (18.9% of total) which featured higher effluent dose (median 33.6 ml/kg/h, IQR 9) and higher filtration fraction (median 31%, IQR 7.4). No electrolyte disorders, catheter displacement, circuit disconnection, unexpected bleeding, air, or thromboembolisms due to venous cannulation of EBP were recorded during the treatment. In one case, infection of vascular access occurred during RRT, requiring replacement., CONCLUSIONS: EBP with heparin-coated hemodiafilter featuring cytokine adsorption properties administered to patients with COVID-19 showed to be feasible and with no adverse events. During the treatment, patients experienced serum IL-6 level reduction, attenuation of systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction improvement, and reduction in expected ICU mortality rate.	false

0	Asthma-associated risk for COVID-19 development. The newly described severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic (Corona virus-induced disease -19, COVID-19). It is now well established that certain comorbidities define high risk patients. They include hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. In contrast, the context with bronchial asthma is controversial and shows marked regional differences. Since asthma is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory lung disease worldwide and SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the upper and lower airways leading to marked inflammation, the question arises about the possible clinical and pathophysiological association between asthma and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Here we analyze the global epidemiology of asthma among COVID-19 patients and propose the concept that patients suffering from different asthma endotypes (type 2 asthma versus non-type 2 asthma) present with a different risk profile in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 and progression to severe COVID-19 outcomes. This concept may have important implications for future COVID-19 diagnostics and immune-based therapy developments. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	COVID-19 Testing and Infection Surveillance: Is a Combined Digital Contact Tracing and Mass Testing Solution Feasible in the United States?. In December 2019, the novel COVID-19 virus spread from a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China to every corner of the globe creating a worldwide pandemic pushing hospital systems past capacity and bringing economies worldwide to a halt. The COVID-19 pandemic is unique in comparison to prior coronavirus epidemics in its superior ability to be spread by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients allowing the virus to silently evade traditional symptoms-based screening approaches. Countries have implemented cutting-edge digital solutions to enhance traditional contact tracing methodologies in combination with novel testing strategies to combat the virus with variable levels of success. Despite having one of the most advanced and expensive health care systems in the world, the United States (U.S.) response is arguably one of the world's largest failures as it leads the globe in case number as well as deaths. Until a successful vaccine can be broadly distributed, it is imperative the U.S. curbs the viral spread by rapidly developing a framework implementing both enhanced tracing and testing strategies balancing the needs of public health while respecting individual liberties. This review will explore the role of technology augmented contact-based surveillance in tracking the outbreak in select countries in comparison to the current U.S. approach. It will evaluate barriers in the US to implementing similar technologies focusing on privacy concerns and a lack of unified testing and tracing strategy. Finally, it will explore strategies for rapidly scaling testing in a cost-effective manner. Copyright © 2020 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	REGN-COV2 antibodies prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques and hamsters. An urgent global quest for effective therapies to prevent and treat COVID-19 disease is ongoing. We previously described REGN-COV2, a cocktail of two potent neutralizing antibodies (REGN10987+REGN10933) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In this report, we evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this antibody cocktail in both rhesus macaques, which may model mild disease, and golden hamsters, which may model more severe disease. We demonstrate that REGN-COV-2 can greatly reduce virus load in lower and upper airways and decrease virus induced pathological sequelae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in rhesus macaques. Similarly, administration in hamsters limits weight loss and decreases lung titers and evidence of pneumonia in the lungs. Our results provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of this antibody cocktail.

0	The De Ritis ratio as prognostic biomarker of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Increased concentrations of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) are common in COVID-19 patients. However, their capacity to predict mortality, particularly the AST/ALT ratio, commonly referred to as the De Ritis ratio, is unknown. We investigated the association between the De Ritis ratio on admission and in-hospital mortality in 105 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to three COVID-19 referral centers in Sardinia, Italy. The De Ritis ratio was significantly lower in survivors than non-survivors (median: 1.25; IQR: 0.91-1.64 vs 1.67; IQR: 1.38-1.97, p=0.002) whilst there were no significant between-group differences in ALT and AST concentrations. In ROC curve analysis, the AUC value of the De Ritis ratio was 0.701 (95% CI 0.603-0.787, p=0.0006) with sensitivity and specificity of 74% and 70%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significant association between the De Ritis ratio and mortality (logrank test p=0.014). By contrast, no associations were observed between the ALT and AST concentrations and mortality (logrank test p=0.83 and p=0.62, respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the HR in patients with De Ritis ratios >=1.63 (upper tertile of this parameter) remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, cardiovascular disease, intensity of care, diabetes, respiratory diseases, malignancies and kidney disease (HR: 2.46, 95% CI 1.05-5.73, p=0.037). Therefore, the De Ritis ratio on admission was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Larger studies are required to confirm the capacity of this parameter to independently predict mortality in this group. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Incidence and treatment of arrhythmias secondary to coronavirus infection in humans: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias are prevalent and reportedly, the second most common complication. Several mechanistic pathways are proposed to explain the pro-arrhythmic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A number of treatment approaches have been trialled, each with its inherent unique challenges. This rapid systematic review aimed to examine the current incidence and available treatment of arrhythmias in COVID-19, as well as barriers to implementation., METHODS: Our search of scientific databases identified relevant published studies from 1st January 2000 until 1st June 2020. We also searched Google Scholar for grey literature. We identified 1729 publications of which 1704 were excluded., RESULTS: The incidence and nature of arrhythmias in the setting of COVID-19 was poorly documented across studies. The cumulative incidence of arrhythmia across studies of hospitalised patients was 6.9%. Drug-induced long QT syndrome secondary to antimalarial and antimicrobial therapy was a significant contributor to arrhythmia formation, with an incidence of 14.15%. Torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was reported. Treatment strategies aim to minimise this through risk stratification and regular monitoring of corrected QT interval (QTc)., CONCLUSION: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at an increased risk of arrhythmias. Drug therapy is pro-arrhythmogenic and may result in TdP and SCD in these patients. Risk assessment and regular QTc monitoring are imperative for safety during the treatment course. Further studies are needed to guide future decision making. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous people in Brazil: a nationwide register-based study. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black people and minority ethnic groups, but there are limited data regarding the impact of disease on Indigenous people. Herein, we investigated the burden of COVID-19 on the Indigenous population in Brazil. We performed a populational-based study including all cases and deaths from COVID-19 among Brazilian Indigenous people from 26 February to 28 August 2020. Data were obtained from official Brazilian information systems. We calculated incidence, mortality and fatality rates for the Indigenous population for each of the five Brazilian regions. Brazil had an incidence and a mortality rate of 3546.4 cases and 65.0 deaths per 100 000 population, respectively. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.8%. The Central-West had the higher estimates of disease burden among Brazilian Indians (incidence rate: 3135.0/100 000; mortality rate: 101.2/100 000 and CFR: 3.2%) followed by the North region (incidence rate: 5664.4/100 000; mortality rate: 92.2/100 000 and CFR: 1.6%). Governmental actions should guarantee the isolation, monitoring and testing capabilities of Indigenous people and rapidly to provide social protection and health facilities.

0	Designing of cytotoxic and helper T cell epitope map provides insights into the highly contagious nature of the pandemic novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as one of the deadliest pathogens of this century, creating an unprecedented pandemic. Belonging to the betacoronavirus family, it primarily spreads through human contact via symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. Despite several attempts since it emerged, there is no known treatment in the form of drugs or vaccines. Hence, work on developing a potential multi-subunit vaccine is the need of the hour. In this study, attempts have been made to find globally conserved epitopes from the entire set of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as there is as yet, no clear information on the immunogenicity of these proteins. Using diverse computational tools, a ranked list of probable immunogenic, promiscuous epitopes generated through all the three main stages of antigen processing and presentation pathways has been prioritized. Moreover, several useful insights were gleaned during these analyses. One of the most important insights is that all of the proteins in this pathogen present unique epitopes, so that the targeting of a few specific viral proteins is not likely to result in an effective immune response in humans. Due to the presence of these unique epitopes in all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, stronger immune responses generated by T cell hyperactivation may lead to cytokine storm and immunopathology and consequently, remote chances of human survival. These epitopes, after due validation in vitro, may thus need to be presented to the human body in that form of multi-subunit epitope-based vaccine that avoids such immunopathologies.

0	Clinical courses and outcomes of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during the covid-19 epidemic in hubei, china. Purpose: In this study, we investigated the acute exacerbation and outcomes of COPD patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 and evaluated the prevalence and mortality of COPD patients with confirmed COVID-19. Method(s): A prospectively recruited cohort of 489 COPD patients was retrospectively followed-up for their conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 2019 to March 2020 in Hubei, China. In addition, the features of 821 discharged patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): Of the 489 followed-up enrolled COPD patients, 2 cases were diagnosed as confirmed COVID-19, and 97 cases had exacerbations, 32 cases of which were hospitalized, and 14 cases died. Compared with the 6-month follow-up results collected 1 year ago, in 307 cases of this cohort, the rates of exacerbations and hospitalization of the 489 COPD patients during the last 4 months decreased, while the mortality rate increased significantly (2.86% vs 0.65%, p=0.023). Of the 821 patients with COVID-19, 37 cases (4.5%) had pre-existing COPD. Of 180 confirmed deaths, 19 cases (10.6%) were combined with COPD. Compared to COVID-19 deaths without COPD, COVID-19 deaths with COPD had higher rates of coronary artery disease and/ or cerebrovascular diseases. Old age, low BMI and low parameters of lung function were risk factors of all-cause mortality for COVID-19 patients with pre-existing COPD. Conclusion(s): Our findings imply that acute exacerbations and hospitalizations of COPD patients were infrequent during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing COPD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality.Copyright © 2020 Hu et al.	false
0	Development of a Clinical MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry Assay for SARS-CoV-2: Rational Design and Multi-Disciplinary Team Work. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has stretched national testing capacities to breaking points in almost all countries of the world. The need to rapidly screen vast numbers of a country's population in order to control the spread of the infection is paramount. However, the logistical requirement for reagent supply (and associated cost) of RT-PCR based testing (the current front-line test) have been hugely problematic. Mass spectrometry-based methods using swab and gargle samples have been reported with promise, but have not approached the task from a systematic analysis of the entire diagnostic process. Here, the pipeline from sample processing, the biological characteristics of the pathogen in human biofluid, the downstream bio- and physical-chemistry and the all-important data processing with clinical interpretation and reporting, are carefully compiled into a single high-throughput and reproducible rapid process. Utilizing MALDI-ToF mass spectrometric detection to viral envelope glycoproteins in a systems biology-multidisciplinary team approach, we have achieved a multifaceted clinical MALDI ToF MS screening test, primarily (but not limited to) SARS-CoV-2, with direct application to other future epidemics/pandemics that may arise. The clinical information generated not only includes SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus detection-(Spike protein fragments S1, S2b, S2a peaks), but other respiratory viral infections detected as well as an assessment of generalised oral upper respiratory immune response (elevated total Ig light chain peak) and a measure of the viral immune response (elevated intensity of IgA heavy chain peak). The advantages of the method include; (1) ease of sampling, (2) speed of analysis, and much reduced cost of testing. These features reveal the diagnostic utility of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as a powerful and economically attractive global solution.	false
0	Worldwide spread of COVID-19 pandemic and risk factors among co-morbid conditions especially diabetes mellitus in India. This narrative review aims to know the association of the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) in patients with diabetes mellitus and other co-morbidities. COVID 19 has reached the number 2.5 million of cases according to the situation report of World Health Organization on 21st, April 2020, affecting nearly 210 countries worldwide. It's highly virulent, involves 'flu-like symptoms', which are mild in most cases, in severe condition, results into acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure leading to the blockage in lower respiratory tract/pathways and difficulty in breathing, it increases the risk for hospitalization and sometimes, leads to death in COVID-19 patients. Most of the patients are asymptomatic, but they can be a carrier to those who have less immunity. Patient with other co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiac problems, and older ages fails to survive as they are more prone to virus infections. The additional burden of disease can be one of the factors to the mortality in these cases.Copyright © RJPT All right reserved.	false

0	Incorporation of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-Associated lipocalin and computed tomography quantification to predict acute kidney injury and in-hospital death in covid-19 patients. Background: The prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is high, with poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 patients who are at risk for AKI and may develop critical illness and death is of great importance. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model of AKI and in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19, incorporating the new tubular injury biomarker urinary neutrophil gelatinase-Associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest computed tomography (CT) analysis. Method(s): A single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included in this study. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and AI-Assisted chest CT imaging variables identified on hospital admission were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to develop a model for predicting the AKI risk. The accuracy of the AKI prediction model was measured using the concordance index (C-index), and the internal validity of the model was assessed by bootstrap resampling. A multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for survival analysis in COVID-19 patients. Result(s): One hundred seventy-four patients were included. The median (+/-SD) age of the patients was 63.59 +/- 13.79 years, and 83 (47.7%) were men.u-NGAL, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and CT ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume were independent predictors of AKI, and all were selected in the nomogram. The prediction model was validated by internal bootstrapping resampling, showing results similar to those obtained from the original samples (i.e., 0.958; 95% CI 0.9097-0.9864). The C-index for predicting AKI was 0.955 (95% CI 0.916-0.995). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed that a high u-NGAL level, an increased GGO volume, and lymphopenia are strong predictors of a poor prognosis and a high risk of in-hospital death. Conclusion(s): This model provides a useful individualized risk estimate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. Measurement of u-NGAL and AI-based chest CT quantification are worthy of application and may help clinicians to identify patients with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 at an early stage.

0	The ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 encodes an immunodominant epitope restricted by HLA-A*01:01. Background: A large global effort is ongoing to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. While there is accumulating information on the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, less is known about the SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are targeted by CD8 T cells. Such knowledge will be of high value to gain fundamental insights into the antigenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 recognized by CD8 T cells, to develop tool allowing focused analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses directly ex vivo, and to understand whether current vaccine designs are covering the CD8 T cell recognized antigens. Method(s): To address this issue, we have analyzed samples from 18 COVID-19 patients for CD8 T cell recognition of 500 predicted SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes restricted to 10 common HLA-A and HLA-B alleles. For each HLA allele, the top 50 epitopes were selected based on predicted binding affinity and likelihood of successful proteasomal processing. To probe for CD8 T cell recognition of the selected epitope-HLA complexes, we made use of our in-house technology based on multiplexing of peptide HLA (pHLA) multimers conjugated to fluorescent dyes. Result(s): In addition to previous studies showing CD8 T cell reactivity towards epitopes derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we have identified several CD8 T cell recognized epitopes derived from the ORF1ab, including one epitope displaying clear immunodominant properties across patients positive for HLA-A*01:01. Investigation of the functional status of part of the identified responses (including 4 responses specific for the immunodominant epitope) revealed that the T cell responses were highly dysfunctional. In addition the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell responses displayed an increased expression of NKG2A in comparison with bulk CD8 T cells, which may explain their dysfunctional state. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that part of the ORF1ab encodes multiple CD8 T cell antigens including one immunodominant epitope. Noteworthy these epitopes were derived from a part of the viral genome that is not included in the majority of vaccine candidates in development, and this may potentially influence their clinical activity and safety profile.

0	COVID-2019: Experience of setting up quarantine center. Indians stranded in countries reporting widespread transmission of COVID-19 in Jan to Mar 2020 were evacuated at short notice. Unclear and evolving evidence on COVID-19, risk of transmission of the disease from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and known cases of COVID-19 has put the spotlight back on the practice of quarantine. The article describes the processes, inter-sectoral coordination and methodology adopted for putting in place all measures for a successful evacuation and subsequent quarantine of the evacuees at the first Quarantine camp set up in India at Manesar, Gurugram near New Delhi by the Armed Forces. No health care worker or support staff contracted any infection with SARS-Cov-2 during the period of care and contact with those quarantined. The archaic practice of quarantine has yet again proven to be a robust and effective Public Health tool with great relevance in the ongoing Pandemic of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

0	Prevalence and severity of malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Background & aims: Nutritional knowledge in patients with SARS-Cov2 infection (COVID-19) is limited. Our objectives were: i) to assess malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ii) to investigate the links between malnutrition and disease severity at admission, iii) to study the impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes such as transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Method(s): Consecutive patients hospitalized in a medicine ward at a university hospital were included from March 21st to April 24th 2020 (n = 114, 60.5% males, age: 59.9 +/- 15.9 years). Nutritional status was defined using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to the presence of malnutrition. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between nutritional parameters and unfavourable outcomes such as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Result(s): The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%). The prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted from ICU. No significant association was found between nutritional status and clinical signs of COVID-19. Lower albumin levels were associated with a higher risk of transfer to ICU (for 10 g/l of albumin, OR [95%CI]: 0.31 [0.1; 0.7]; p < 0.01) and this association was independent of age and CRP levels. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 in medical units dedicated to non-intensive care is associated with a high prevalence of malnutrition, especially for patients transferred from ICU. These data emphasize the importance of early nutritional screening in these patients to adapt management accordingly.Copyright © 2020 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism	false
0	Prosthetic heart valves and the COVID-19 pandemic era: What should we be concerned about?. Background: The disturbance in the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy is of concern. We aimed to evaluate coagulation features in hospitalized patients under warfarin treatment for prosthetic heart valves during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic. Method(s): Between 20 February and 28 March 2020, 10 patients (7 males) who were under warfarin therapy for prosthetic heart valves were hospitalized after a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Tehran Heart Center, Tehran, Iran. The clinical, paraclinical, and in-hospital outcomes were described. The patients were followed for 4 weeks. Result(s): The median age was 62 years. All the patients received antiviral treatment, either lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir. The serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ranged between 0.24 and 15.24 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransaminase was normal in all the patients except for two, with levels 1.6 and 4.2 times above normal values. The INR increased in all the patients. One (10%) patient died in the hospital. No bleeding, ischemic, or thrombotic events occurred during the hospital stay and within the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Antiviral therapy in patients with COVID-19 with prosthetic heart valves might be an issue responsible for an uncontrolled INR. Liver injury may happen in a minority of patients. Bridging in these patients during the antiviral treatment might be required and because of significant INR fluctuations, it might be safer to prescribe antiviral treatment in an inpatient setting.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Should We Rely on Screening Tests for Further Management Alone in Polymerase Chain Reaction Negative COVID-19 Patients? A Case Series. Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), it has been a challenge to the whole medical community. Researchers and clinicians have been trying to explain and explore its mechanism and pathophysiology to get a better understanding of this disease, as it has exhausted the healthcare resources and has impacted human life in general. Many tests have been developed including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the virus and rapid diagnostic testing in patients based on IgM/IgG serology. But owing to variable sensitivity and specificity of these tests, it has created a challenging situation to proceed with the further management plan. We are reporting a case series where we experienced the dilemma of diagnosing COVID-9 disease in our patients and further plan of care.	false
0	Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody by a pseudotyped virus-based assay. Pseudotyped viruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility. On the basis of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped virus production system, we developed a pseudotyped virus-based neutralization assay against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in biosafety level 2 facilities. Compared with the binding antibody test, the neutralization assay could discriminate the protective agents from the antibody family. This protocol includes production and titration of the SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus and the neutralization assay based on it. Various types of samples targeting virus attachment and entry could be evaluated for their potency, including serum samples derived from animals and humans, monoclonal antibodies and fusion inhibitors (peptides or small molecules). If the pseudotyped virus stock has been prepared in advance, it will take 2 days to get the potency data for the candidate samples. Experience in handling cells is needed before implementing this protocol. The production and titration of the SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus using a VSV-based pseudovirus production system in this protocol enable its use under biosafety level 2 conditions as well as in a neutralization assay to assess the level of neutralizing antibodies or molecular inhibitors in a sample.	false

0	S protein-reactive IGG and memory B cell production after human SARS-CoV-2 infection includes broad reactivity to the S2 subunit. The high susceptibility of humans to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reflects the novelty of the virus and limited preexisting B cell immunity. IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBC levels. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG, and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD-and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 were higher in convalescent subjects than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protec-tion. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection sug-gests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane. IMPORTANCE The recent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key issues are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre-and postinfection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs re-main to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.Copyright © 2020 Nguyen-Contant et al.	false
0	Understanding the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender perspective. Under the threat of the new coronavirus pandemic, women have been uniquely impacted financially, economically, and socially. However, in terms of disease incidence and lethality, women perform better than men. The main reason is that, in addition to women's own hormonal protection, women's immune systems are superior to those of men. Women also exhibit more protective behavior (e.g., hand-washing) and more closely follow protection guidelines, which greatly reduces the chance of infection. In the future, more studies that adopt a gender perspective are needed to understand the various dilemmas faced by women in infectious diseases and pandemics; only then can women demonstrate better outcomes.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Establishment of replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based recombinant viruses suitable for SARS-CoV-2 entry and neutralization assays. Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based recombinant viruses are useful tools for studying emerging and highly pathogenic enveloped viruses in level 2 biosafety facilities. Here, we used a replication-competent recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) encoding the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in place of the original G glycoprotein (rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) to develop a high-throughput entry assay for SARS-CoV-2. The S protein was incorporated into the recovered rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 particles, which could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 also displayed entry characteristics similar to the wild type virus, such as cell tropism and pH-dependence. The neutralizing titers of antibodies and sera measured by rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 were highly correlated with those measured by wild-type viruses or pseudoviruses. Therefore, this is a safe and convenient screening tool for SARS-CoV-2, and it may promote the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.	false
0	Pulmonary embolism and covid-19. Aims There is increasing concern amongst clinicians of a possible increase in venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in patients with COVID-19. There remains limited data defining the incidence of VTE in this population and thus also a paucity of research examining the impact of targeted treatment in patients with thrombotic complications. Methods We examined the number of symptomatic VTE events amongst proven COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary level academic hospital, over a one-month period. Patient characteristics, admission and discharge inflammatory and coagulation markers were included in the analysis. Results Sixty-one patients were identified. Twelve patients (19.6%) admitted with COVID-19 were treated for a suspected PE. Of these patients, 3 patients were discharged on anticoagulation, 3 died and 6 remain inpatients at the end of the study period. Discussion COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of VTE. This risk may extend beyond the period of admission. Further research examining the role of extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients beyond hospital discharge is warranted.Copyright © 2020, Irish Medical Association.

0	Isolation and Propagation of Coronaviruses in Embryonated Eggs. The embryonated egg is a complex structure comprised of an embryo and its supporting membranes (chorioallantoic, amniotic, and yolk). The developing embryo and its membranes provide a diversity of cell types that allow for the successful replication of a wide variety of different viruses. Within the family Coronaviridae the embryonated egg has been used as a host system primarily for two avian coronaviruses within the genus Gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV). IBV replicates well in the embryonated chicken egg, regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as the virus replicates well in epithelium lining the chorioallantoic membrane, with high virus titers found in these membranes and associated allantoic fluids. TCoV replicates only in epithelium lining the embryo intestines and bursa of Fabricius; thus, amniotic inoculation is required for isolation and propagation of this virus. Embryonated eggs also provide a potential host system for detection, propagation, and characterization of other, novel coronaviruses.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Glycan-immobilized dual-channel field effect transistor biosensor for the rapid identification of pandemic influenza viral particles. Pandemic influenza, triggered by the mutation of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (IFV), has caused considerable damage to public health. In order to identify such pandemic IFVs, antibodies that specifically recognize viral surface proteins have been widely used. However, since the analysis of a newly discovered virus is time consuming, this delays the availability of suitable detection antibodies, making this approach unsuitable for the early identification of pandemic IFVs. Here we propose a label-free semiconductor-based biosensor functionalized with sialic-acid-containing glycans for the rapid identification of the pandemic IFVs present in biological fluids. Specific glycans are able to recognize wild-type human and avian IFVs, suggesting that they are useful in discovering pandemic IFVs at the early stages of an outbreak. We successfully demonstrated that a dual-channel integrated FET biosensing system, which were modified with 6'-sialyllactose and 3'-sialyllactose for each gate area, can directly and specifically detect human H1N1 and avian H5N1 IFV particles, respectively, present in nasal mucus. Furthermore, to examine the possibility of identifying pandemic IFVs, the signal attributed to the detection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) particles, which was selected as a prime model of a pandemic IFV, was clearly observed from both sensing gates. Our findings suggest that the proposed glycan-immobilized sensing system could be useful in identifying new pandemic IFVs at the source of an outbreak.	false
0	COVID-19: Infection or Autoimmunity. The clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 are reviewed with attention to the immunologic manifestations of the disease. Recent COVID-19 publications describe a variety of clinical presentations including an asymptomatic state, pneumonia, a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis like syndrome, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) but, also called Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-Toxic Shock (PIMS-TS), Kawasaki Disease, and myocarditis. A common theme amongst multiple reports suggests an overexuberant autoimmune component of the disease but a common pathophysiology to explain the variations in clinical presentation has been elusive. Review of the basic science of other viral induced autoimmune disorders may give clues as to why immunosuppressive and immunomodulating regimens now appear to have some efficacy in COVID-19. Review of the immunopathology also reveals other therapies that have yet to be explored. There is potential use of T cell depleting therapies and possibly anti-CD20 therapy for COVID-19 and clinical research using these medications is warranted.© Copyright © 2020 Icenogle.	false

0	Impact of COVID19 Pandemic on the Incidence and Management of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest in Patients Presenting with Acute Myocardial Infarction in England. Background Studies have reported significant reduction in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) related hospitalizations during the COVID19 pandemic. However, whether these trends are associated with increased incidence of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) in this population is unknown. Methods and Results AMI hospitalizations with OHCA during the COVID19 period (1st February-14th May 2020) from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project and British Cardiovascular Intervention Society datasets were analysed. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson models with equivalent pre-COVID19 period (1st February-14th May 2019) as reference. AMI hospitalizations during COVID19 period were reduced by more than 50% (n=20,310 vs n=9,325). OHCA was more prevalent during the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID period (5.6% vs. 3.6%), with a 56% increase in the incidence of OHCA (incidence rate ratio: 1.56, 95%CI 1.39-1.74). OHCA patients during COVID19 period were likely to be older, female, of Asian ethnicity and more likely to present with STEMI. The overall rates of invasive coronary angiography (58.4% vs. 71.6%, p<0.001) were significantly lower amongst the OHCA during COVID19 period with increased time to reperfusion (mean 2.1 hours vs. 1.1 hours, p=0.05) in STEMI. The adjusted in-hospital mortality probability increased from 27.7% in February 2020 to 35.8% in May 2020 in the COVID19 group (p <0.001). Conclusions In this national cohort of hospitalized AMI patients, we observed a significant rise in incidence of OHCA during COVID period paralleled with reduced access to guidelines recommended care and increased in-hospital mortality.	false
0	The assessment of the relationship between abo blood groups and COVID-19 infection. The new coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading around the world and has been declared an outbreak by WHO. However, the effect of blood groups on COVID-19 infection and the severity of the disease is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between ABO blood group and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and whether the blood group will be a biomarker for COVID-19 infection. Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020 were included in this study. In order to compare the blood groups of the patients with the healthy group, patients who had previously performed ABO blood group analysis in the blood bank between February and May 2020 were included as the control group. Demographic data, clinical data, underlying comorbidities, laboratory findings and clinical results (hospitalization, need for intensive care, mortality) were obtained from the electronic medical records. A total of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 5200 healthy control patients were included in the study. Patients with COVID-19 showed a distribution of 62.01% in group A,9.50% in group B, 8.94% in group AB and 19.55% in group O. In group A, length of stay in Intensive Care Unit was longer (10.42+/-11.61 days; p= 0.013). Compared to the blood groups of the healthy control group, COVID-19 patients had higher A blood group than the healthy group (62& vs.46.6%; p< 0.001) and lesser of the O blood group (19.6% vs. 34.7%; p< 0.001).Blood group A can be used as a predictive biomarker for COVID-19 disease.In addition, we concluded that the group A had a higher risk for COVID-19 disease and severity.Copyright © 2020, UHOD - Uluslararasi Hematoloji Onkoloji Dergisi.

0	The association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19: A living rapid evidence review with Bayesian meta-analyses (version 7). AIMS: To estimate the association of smoking status with rates of i) infection, ii) hospitalisation, iii) disease severity, and iv) mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 disease., DESIGN: Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv., SETTING: Community or hospital. No restrictions on location., PARTICIPANTS: Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis., MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor')., FINDINGS: Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR=0.74, 95% Credible Interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, tau = 0.41). Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, tau = 0.17) but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR >=1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalisation (RR=1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, tau = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR=1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, tau = 0.29), and mortality (RR=1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, tau = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, tau = 0.27; RR=1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, tau = 0.34; RR=1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, tau = 0.49 respectively) but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalisation and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR >=1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR >=1.1)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalisation, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Meaningful in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Response to Van Overmeire's Commentary on Karatzias et al. (2020). In a recently published study in this journal that used a population-based sample in the Republic of Ireland (Karatzias et al., 2020), we concluded that 17.7% of the sample met the diagnostic requirements for COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Subsequently, Van Overmeire (2020) has raised concerns about the validity of our findings, arguing that simply experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic is not sufficient to meet the trauma exposure criterion for a PTSD diagnosis and, consequently, our estimated PTSD prevalence figure was inflated. In this response, we provide (a) an explanation for why the COVID-19 pandemic can be reasonably considered to be a traumatic event, (b) evidence that PTSD in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a meaningful construct, and (c) an argument for why our estimated prevalence rate is not unreasonably high.

0	"Personality regulation of decisions on physical distancing: Cross-cultural comparison (Russia, Azerbaijan, China). The present study investigated cross-cultural comparison of the personality variables (rationality, risk readiness, empathy, Dark Triad traits, implicit theories of emotions) in predicting decisions on physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 1077 participants from Russia, Azerbaijan, and China. After reporting if they trust the media, participants chose from different reasons why they wear or don't wear a mask: care for self vs others, risk for oneself vs others, autonomy for oneself vs others, risk estimation, law-abidingness; then participants completed questionnaires. We expected people from collectivistic countries to make decisions based on care for others and people from more individualistic countries - on care for self and autonomy. The results revealed a different trend: participants from all countries chose care for self more frequently than other reasons. This was most prevalent in China, less - in Azerbaijan and less so - in Russia. Rationality and empathy were positive predictors of decisions to wear a mask, risk readiness and psychopathy were negative predictors, the role of narcissism depended on the country. Implicit theories of emotions correlated with empathy in China and Azerbaijan. These two measures predicted the choice of ""care for others"" over ""care for self"" in all countries.

While the coronavirus pandemic has spread around the world like wildfire since almost 7 months of its emergence, domestic violence has been breeding endlessly like a ""silent pandemic"" and is similarly globally persevered. Violence against women exacerbates during such emergencies on account of heightened tension and close living conditions due to lockdowns regulated by state orders. In Pakistan, where domestic violence is a ""taboo"" object of discussion, help is not provided from neighboring citizens, or even by law enforcers, leaving victims to endure in solitude acts of verbal, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse in the name of alleged supremacy of the assailant."	false
0	"Characteristics and outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French intensive care units according to antiviral strategies: the COVADIS multicentre observational study. Background: Limited data are available regarding antiviral therapy efficacy in most severe patients under mechanical ventilation for Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Method(s): Comparison of antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (OHQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir) in an observational multicentre cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe Covid-19 ARDS. The primary endpoint was the number of day 28 ventilator-free days (VFD). Patients who died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized into ""patients still ventilated or dead at day 28"" versus ""patients weaned and alive at day 28"". Result(s): We analyzed 415 patients (85 treated with standard of care (SOC), 57 with L/R, 220 with OHQ, and 53 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and differed between groups (P = 0.03), SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. After adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and plateau pressure and accounting for center effect with a generalized linear mixed model, none of the antiviral strategies increased the chance of being alive and weaned from MV at day 28 compared to the SOC strategy (OR 0.48 CI95% (0.18-1.25); OR 0.96 (0.47-2.02) and OR 1.43 (0.53-4.04) for L/R, OHQ and other treatments, respectively). Acute kidney injury during ICU stay was frequent (55%); its incidence was higher in patients receiving lopinavir (66 vs 53%, P = 0.03). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, chronic hypertension and chronic renal disease, the use of L/R was associated with an increased risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT). (OR 2.52 CI95% 1.16-5.59). Conclusion(s): In this multicentre observational study of moderate-to-severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observe any benefit among patients treated with OHQ or L/R compared with SOC. The use of L/R treatment was associated with an increased need for RRT. Take home message Neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir/ritonavir as COVID-19 antiviral treatment is associated with higher ventilator-free days at day 28 when compared with standard of care (no antiviral treatment) in ICU patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. Lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with an increased risk of renal replacement therapy requirement. Tweet COVID-19: Insights from ARDS cohort: no signal of efficacy of any antiviral drugs.

0	A case of tocilizumab-induced leukoencephalopathy with a reversible clinical course. Tocilizumab (TCZ; Actemra/RoActemra) is an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases and cytokine storms. The present case is a 63-year-old female well-controlled RA patient, who presented with a progressive cognitive impairment after 34 months of TCZ administration. Brain MRI showed leukencephalopathy with a lactic acid peak in MRS, a decreased blood flow in SPECT, and a decreased accumulation in FDG-PET. The discontinuation of TCZ improved her cognitive function and brain MRI findings at 3 months after drug cessation. The present case suggests that TCZ may sometimes cause leukoencephalopathy after long-term administration, and thus the early discontinuation of TCZ is recommended to achieve a good prognosis.	false
0	[The peak of the Coronavirus emergency and hemodialysis patients: the experience of the Dialysis Center in Crema]. Lombardy was violently hit by Covid-19 between the end of February and the beginning of March 2020. On 09.05.2020 there were 81225 total registered Covid-19+ cases (8051 / million inhabitants) with 14924 deaths (1479 deaths / million inhabitants). The province of Cremona presented a higher number of Covid-19+ cases and a worse relative mortality than the already high regional average. Patients on regular hemodialysis treatment present a high risk of infection due to the co-pathologies present, while healthcare workers may represent a risk for themselves and for the patients, due to the treatment environment and the close contact with them. All patients and healthcare workers of the Dialysis Center in Crema were evaluated (oro-pharyngeal swab for viral RNA research, qualitative anti-Covid-19 antibodies, quantitative IgG antibodies, co-pathologies), regardless of the symptomatology, over a 60-day period. Hemodialysis patients have a risk of infection that is 12.7 times that of the local population, while healthcare workers outperform the patients for Covid-positivity (30.3% vs 21.6%). Lethality in infected patients is high (31% of Covid-19+ subjects), while it is zero among healthcare professionals. The antibody response (qualitative and quantitative) in Covid-19+ patients is adequate, when compared to that of Covid-19+ healthcare staff. In our Center, the most critical phase lasted about 45 days but, thanks to the measures taken, it was possible to make the dialysis area Covid-free, as it remains after 128 days.	false
0	COVID-19 pneumonia: high diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in patients with intermediate clinical probability. Objectives: To assess inter-reader agreements and diagnostic accuracy of chest CT to identify COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with intermediate clinical probability during an acute disease outbreak. Method(s): From March 20 to April 8, 319 patients (mean age 62.3 years old) consecutive patients with an intermediate clinical probability of COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a chest CT scan. Two independent chest radiologists blinded to clinical information and RT-PCR results retrospectively reviewed and classified images on a 1-5 confidence level scale for COVID-19 pneumonia. Agreements between radiologists were assessed with kappa statistics. Diagnostic accuracy of chest CT compared with RT-PCR assay and patient outcomes was measured using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for COVID-19 pneumonia were calculated. Result(s): Inter-observer agreement for highly probable (kappa: 0.83 [p <.001]) and highly probable or probable (kappa: 0.82 [p <.001]) diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was very good. RT-PCR tests performed in 307 patients were positive in 174 and negative in 133. The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.94 and 0.92 respectively. With a disease prevalence of 61.2%, PPV were 95.9% and 94.3%, and NPV 84.4% and 77.1%. Conclusion(s): During acute COVID-19 outbreak, chest CT scan may be used for triage of patients with intermediate clinical probability with very good inter-observer agreements and diagnostic accuracy. Key Points: * Concordances between two chest radiologists to diagnose or exclude a COVID-19 pneumonia in 319 consecutive patients with intermediate clinical probability were very good (kappa: 0.82; p <.001). * When compared with RT-PCR results and patient outcomes, the diagnostic accuracy of CT to identify COVID-19 pneumonia was high for both radiologists (AUC: 0.94 and 0.92). * With a disease prevalence of 61.2% in the studied population, the positive predictive values of CT for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia were 95.9% and 94.3% with negative predictive values of 84.4% and 77.1%.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.	false
0	Metabolic associated fatty liver disease increases the severity of COVID-19: A meta-analysis. Background: The association between metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and disease progression in patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unclear. Aim(s): To explore the association between MAFLD and the severity of COVID-19 by meta-analysis. Method(s): We conducted a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Medline (OVID), and MedRxiv from inception to July 6, 2020. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Stata 14.0 were used for quality assessment of included studies as well as for performing a pooled analysis. Result(s): A total of 6 studies with 1,293 participants were included after screening. Four studies reported the prevalence of MAFLD patients with COVID-19, with a pooled prevalence of 0.31 for MAFLD (95CI 0.28, 0.35, I2 = 38.8%, P = 0.179). MAFLD increased the risk of COVID-19 disease severity, with a pooled OR of 2.93 (95CI 1.87, 4.60, I2 = 34.3%, P = 0.166). Conclusion(s): In this meta-analysis, we found that a high percentage of patients with COVID-19 had MAFLD. Meanwhile, MAFLD increased the risk of disease progression among patients with COVID-19. Thus, better intensive care and monitoring are needed for MAFLD patients infected by SARS-COV-2.Copyright © 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.	false
0	Creating a safe workplace by universal testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients and healthcare workers in the electrophysiology units: a multi-center experience. Background: As the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our electrophysiology (EP) community. Furthermore, we assessed the new infection rate in patients undergoing EP procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Method(s): Viral-RNA and serology tests were conducted in 1670 asymptomatic subjects including patients and their caregivers and staff in our EP units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff. Result(s): Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were patients and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff, and staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in positivity rate was observed from April to June 2020 (p = 0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n = 31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting. Staff testing positive (n = 33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during or within 2 weeks after the hospital-stay. Conclusion(s): Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP units.

0	Unicorn Poo and Blessed Waters: COVID-19 Quackery and FDA Warning Letters. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global setting of clinical crisis and human anxiety. Without available safe and effective vaccines and cures, an unscrupulous marketplace has emerged selling COVID-19 quackery (fraudulent misrepresentation of preventions and treatments). Method(s): US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning Letters issued from March 2020 to July 2020 were analyzed for themes pertaining to unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded COVID-19 products. Result(s): During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. Conclusion(s): A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery. FDA Warning Letters are a component of meaningful corrective action; however, greater effort in spreading awareness of such misrepresented, unapproved, and adulterated products is needed to deter purchases of such products.Copyright © 2020, The Drug Information Association, Inc.	false
0	Antibodies at work in the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In view of devastating effects of COVID-19 on human life, there is an urgent need for the licened vaccines or therapeutics for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy	false
0	COVID-19 in Kidney Transplantation: Outcomes, Immunosuppression Management, and Operational Challenges. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. If infected, older individuals and those with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and compromised immune systems are at higher risk for unfavorable outcomes. These comorbidities are prevalent in patients with kidney disease, hence the significant burden of COVID-19 on kidney transplant programs. Multiple case series of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have shown increased mortality compared to nontransplant patients. To date, we do not have high-level evidence to inform immunosuppression minimization strategies in infected transplant recipients. Most centers however have adopted early antimetabolite withdrawal in addition to other interventions. This review summarizes the published COVID-19 literature as it relates to outcomes and immunosuppression management in kidney transplant recipients. It also discusses challenges pertaining to pretransplant evaluation and wait-listed patients.Copyright © 2020 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.	false
0	Large Vessel Occlusion Secondary to COVID-19 Hypercoagulability in a Young Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially most appreciated for its pulmonary symptoms, is now increasingly recognized for causing multi-organ disease and stroke in the setting of a hypercoagulable state. We report a case of 33-year-old African American woman with COVID-19 who developed acute malignant middle cerebral artery infarction due to thromboembolic occlusion of the left terminal internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery stem. Mechanical thrombectomy was challenging and ultimately unsuccessful resulting in limited reperfusion of <67% of the affected vascular territory, and thrombectomized clot was over 50 mm in length, at least three times the average clot length. The final stroke size was estimated at 224 cubic centimeters. On admission her D-dimer level was 94,589 ng/mL (normal 0-500 ng/ml). Throughout the hospitalization D-dimer decreased but never reached normal values while fibrinogen trended upward. Hypercoagulability panel was remarkable for mildly elevated anticardiolipin IgM of 16.3 MPL/mL (normal: 0-11.0 MPL/mL). With respect to remaining stroke workup, there was no evidence of clinically significant stenosis or dissection in the proximal internal carotid artery or significant cardioembolic source including cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombus, cardiac tumor, valvular abnormality, aortic arch atheroma, or patent foramen ovale. She developed malignant cytotoxic cerebral edema and succumbed to complications. This case underscores the importance of recognizing hypercoagulability as a cause of severe stroke and poor outcome in young patients with COVID-19 and highlights the need for further studies to define correlation between markers of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 infection and outcome post stroke.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in COVID-19 patients: a meta-analysis. Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks has shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric and mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. To construct a comprehensive picture of the mental health status in COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances in this population. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Wanfang Data, Wangfang Med Online, CNKI, and CQVIP for relevant articles, and we included 31 studies (n = 5153) in our analyses. We found that the pooled prevalence of depression was 45% (95% CI: 37-54%,I-2 = 96%), the pooled prevalence of anxiety was 47% (95% CI: 37-57%,I-2 = 97%), and the pooled prevalence of sleeping disturbances was 34% (95% CI: 19-50%,I-2 = 98%). We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence estimates between different genders; however, the depression and anxiety prevalence estimates varied based on different screening tools. More observational studies assessing the mental wellness of COVID-19 outpatients and COVID-19 patients from countries other than China are needed to further examine the psychological implications of COVID-19 infections.	false

0	Lifestyle behaviors changes during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine among 6,881 Brazilian adults with depression and 35,143 without depression. Our aim was to analyze the association between previously diagnosed lifetime depression and changes in physical activity (PA), TV-viewing, consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as frequency of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption. Data of 41,923 Brazilian adults (6,881 with depression and 35,042 without depression) were used. Participants reported PA (>= 150 min/week), TV-viewing (>= 4 h/day), frequency of eating fruits or vegetables (<= 4 days/week) and UPF (>= 5 days/week). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before the quarantine. People without and with depression presented, respectively, incidence of physical inactivity [70.1% (95%CI: 67.4-72.8) vs 76.3 (70.3-81.5)], high TV-viewing [31.2 (29.6-32.8) vs 33.9 (30.5-37.4)], low frequency of fruit or vegetable consumption [28.3 (25.8-31.0) vs 31.5 (26.1-37.5)] and elevated frequency of UPF consumption [9.7 (8.9-10.7) vs 15.2 (13.0-17.7)]. Participants with depression were more likely to present elevated frequency of UPF consumption incidence [OR:1.49 (95%CI:1.21-1.83)]. Thus, participants with previous diagnosis of depression were at risk for incidence of unhealthy diet behaviors.	false
0	Mapping Neutralizing and Immunodominant Sites on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain by Structure-Guided High-Resolution Serology. Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection and identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49 days, nAb titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics., Serological analyses of ~650 SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals show that 90% of the serum or plasma neutralizing activity targets the virus receptor-binding domain, with structural insights revealing how distinct types of neutralizing antibodies targeting the ACE2-binding site dominate the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 spike.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Is Mesenteric Ischemia In COVID-19 Patients A Surprise?. Aim. The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus is known predominantly for its respiratory outcomes; a subset of critically ill patients demonstrates clinically remarkable hypercoagulability in which thrombotic events range from acute pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to extremity ischemia. Our observational study aimed to describe the incidence and characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes, of patients presenting and treated for mesenteric ischemia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods. Between March 13 and May 13, 2020, 60 patients operated for emergency reasons were analyzed, and it was noticed that 5 of the 6 COVID-positive patients were operated due to mesenteric ischemia. Results. Five of sixty patients (83.3%) applied to our emergency clinic with COVID-19 positive and acute abdomen. Two of them (40%) did not have any comorbidities. All of them (%100) were male. There were no complications and only 1 death (20%). Mean leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet levels were within the normal range, while the lymphocyte level was near the lower limit. C-Reactive Protein was above the limit in all patients. The mean levels of International Normalized Ratio, Platelet, and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time were above the limits. While D-dimer levels were close to the upper limit; fibrinogen levels were above the normal limit for each patient. Conclusion. The presence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-19 patients should be observed closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. More clinical data are needed to examine the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19 treatment.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Immature platelets in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with high incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Currently, there are no markers to guide antithrombotic therapy in Covid-19. Immature platelets represent a population of hyper-reactive platelets associated with arterial events. This prospective study compared consecutive Covid-19 patients (n = 47, median age = 56 years) to patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n = 100, median age = 59 years) and a group of stable patients with cardiovascular risk factors (n = 64, median age = 68 years). Immature platelet fraction (IPF) and immature platelet count (IPC) were determined by the Sysmex XN-3000 auto-analyzer on admission and at subsequent time-points. IPF% on admission was higher in Covid-19 than the stable group and similar to the AMI group (4.8% [IQR 3.4-6.9], 3.5% [2.7-5.1], 4.55% [3.0-6.75], respectively, p = 0.0053). IPC on admission was also higher in Covid-19 than the stable group and similar to the AMI group (10.8 x 109/L [8.3-18.1], 7.35 x 109/L [5.3-10.5], 10.7 x 109/L [7.7-16.8], respectively, P < 0.0001). The maximal IPF% among the Covid-19 group was higher than the stable group and similar to the AMI group. The maximal IPC in Covid-19 was higher than the maximal IPC in both the stable and AMI groups (COVID-19: 14.4 x 109/L [9.4-20.9], AMI: 10.9 x 109/L [7.6-15.2], P = 0.0035, Stable: 7.55 x 109/L [5.55-10.5], P < 0.0001). Patients with Covid-19 have increased immature platelets indices compared to stable patients with cardiovascular risk factors, and as the disease progresses also compared to AMI patients. The enhanced platelet turnover and reactivity may have a role in the development of thrombotic events in Covid-19 patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism in intensive care or medical ward. Despite thromboprophylaxis, patients with coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) exhibit hypercoagulability and higher venous thromboembolic risk, although its real incidence is still unknown. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients admitted to both intensive care unit and medical ward. Consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 to medical ward and intensive care unit at Padua University Hospital, all receiving thromboprophylaxis, underwent systematic ultrasonography of internal jugular, upper and lower limbs veins every 7(+/-1) days after the admission; and if negative, once-weekly until discharge or death. In case of suspected pulmonary embolism, a multi-detector computed tomographic angiography was performed. The primary outcome was the proportion of any deep-vein thrombosis and symptomatic pulmonary embolism in both groups. An extended blood coagulative test was performed as well. From March 4 to April 30, 2020 a total of 85 patients were investigated, 44 (52%) in medical ward and 41 (48%) in intensive care unit. Despite thromboprophylaxis, venous thromboembolism occurred in 12 medical ward (27.3%) and 31 intensive care unit patients (75.6%) with an Odds Ratio of 9.3 (95%CI, 3.5 to 24.5;p<0.001). Multiple-site deep-vein thrombosis occurred in 55.6% of patients (95%CI, 39.6 to 70.5). Increased D-Dimer levels significantly correlated with venous thromboembolism (p=0.001) and death (p=0.015). Summarizing, COVID-19 patients admitted to medical ward or intensive care unit showed a high frequency of venous thromboembolism, despite standard- or high-dose thromboprophylaxis. Whether thrombosis, particularly asymptomatic events, may play a role in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients remain to be clarified.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Impact of COVID-19quarantine on low back pain intensity, prevalence, and associated risk factors among adult citizens residing in riyadh (Saudi Arabia): A cross-sectional study. This study aimed to estimate the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine on low back pain (LBP) intensity, prevalence, and associated risk factors among adults in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). A total of 463 adults (259 males and 204 females) aged between 18 and 64 years and residing in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered structured questionnaire composed of 20 questions regarding demographic characteristics, work-and academic-related aspects, physical activity (PA), daily habits and tasks, and pain-related aspects was used. The LBP point prevalence before the quarantine was 38.8%, and 43.8% after the quarantine. The LBP intensity significantly increased during the quarantine. The low back was also the most common musculoskeletal pain area. Furthermore, during the quarantine, a significantly higher LBP intensity was reported by those individuals who (a) were aged between 35 and 49 years old, (b) had a body mass index equal to or exceeding 30, (c) underwent higher levels of stress, (d) did not comply with the ergonomic recommendations, (e) were sitting for long periods, (f) did not practice enough physical activity (PA), and (g) underwent teleworking or distance learning. No significant differences were found between genders. The COVID-19 quarantine resulted in a significant increase in LBP intensity, point prevalence, and most associated risk factors.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

With a more stable phenotype, mutation D614G has become dominant. Its structural impact prompts the development of an antibody that destabilizes the virus quaternary structure where it is most vulnerable. Vaccine-related antigenic regions are different from the proposed epitope, hence avoiding therapeutic redundancy.Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.	false

0	Novel serological biomarkers for inflammation in predicting disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Background: Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop acute respiratory distress and multi-system organ failure and are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to determine the risk of developing serious illness. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 114 patients with COVID-19 at the Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan based on their clinical and laboratory data. Patients were categorized into severe and mild to moderate disease groups. We analyzed the potential of serological inflammation indicators in predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and nomogram analysis. The Spearman method was used to understand the correlation between the serological biomarkers and duration of hospital stay. Result(s): Patients with severe disease had reduced neutrophils and lymphocytes; severe coagulation dysfunction; altered content of biochemical factors (such as urea, lactate dehydrogenase); elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte, and derived neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios, high sensitivity C-reactive protein-prealbumin ratio (HsCPAR), systemic immune-inflammation index, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (HsCAR); and low lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio. PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR correlated with the risk of severe disease. The nomogram combining the three parameters showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.873 and reliable calibration. Moreover, HsCAR and HsCPAR correlated with duration of hospital stay. Conclusion(s): Taken together, PNI, HsCAR, and HsCPAR may serve as accurate biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 upon admission/hospitalization.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

Background: To date, there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of the use of any drugs for the prevention of COVID-19. However, we have a number of promising drugs at our disposal, which may be potential candidates in COVID-19 prevention. The main aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among healthy volunteers using nasal INF-gamma as a preventive measure. Methods and Results: In this observational prospective study, we used INF-gamma in a dosage form for intranasal administration to identify a prophylactic effect in volunteers at high risk of getting COVID-19 - medical workers and personnel working in the “red zone.” Prophylactic efficacy was evaluated by the incidence of COVID-19 among volunteers when using the study drug (the study group) in comparison with the control group. The mean score on the WHO clinical improvement scale in the two groups was also analyzed. For each participant in the study, initial demographic and epidemiological data were collected: age, gender, the average frequency of acute respiratory viral infection (per year), as well as information on professional activities (work schedule and the number of patients with whom the participant contacts every day). Findings showed that most participants previously had about 45%-48% cases of acute respiratory diseases per year. As a result, we saw good tolerance to COVID-19: 98% and 86% of subjects of both groups did not get sick during the period of observation, although the first group showed statistically significant (P=0.0019) better results in disease prevalence. In addition, the comparative analysis demonstrated 0.02 and 0.14 scores of the WHO clinical improvement scale in the study group and control group, respectively (P=0.0255). None of the subjects had adverse events. Conclusion: This study concluded that there is a potential positive preventive effect of nasal INF-gamma against ARVI including COVID-19 in healthy volunteers. INF-gamma use was safe and well tolerated.	false

0	Influenza-like illness and SARS-Cov-2 in the multicenter, prospective, observational INVIDIa-2 study (INfluenza Vaccine Indication During therapy with Immune checkpoint inhibitors: A transversal challenge): A FICOG study. Background: The susceptibility of advanced cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for viral infections has not been investigated. Currently, there are no robust data supporting the efficacy, safety and recommendation for influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving ICI. Method(s): The prospective, multicenter, observational INVIDIa-2 study investigated the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors receiving ICI between October 2019 and January 2020. The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI, primary endpoint) was observed until April 30, 2020. Secondary endpoints included a non-prespecified analysis for COVID-19. Result(s): The study enrolled 1279 patients; 1188 were evaluable. Of them, 11 patients developed ILI symptoms with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (incidence of 0.9% and lethality of 72%, irrespective of the flu vaccination). Of the remaining 1177 patients, 574 received flu vaccination (48.8%). The ILI incidence was 7.7% (91 patients of 1177). Patients receiving the flu vaccine were significantly more frequently elderly (p<0.0001), former or active smokers (p<0.0001), affected by lung cancer (p=0.017) and by non-cancer comorbidities (p<0.0001) when compared to unvaccinated patients. The flu vaccine did not prevent ILI in the study population, irrespective of the vaccine type (quadrivalent vs trivalent, adjuvated vs non): the incidence of ILI was 8.2% in vaccinated vs 7.3% in unvaccinated patients (p=0.57). ILI complications were significantly less frequent for patients receiving flu vaccine (12.8% vs 40.9%, p=0.002). Hospital admission due to ILI occurred for 10 patients (11% of ILI cases; 7 were unvaccinated). The ILI lethality was 2.2% (2 of 91 patients, both unvaccinated). Among vaccinated patients, those receiving adjuvated vaccines had lower incidence of ILI (4.8% vs 9.9%, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Flu vaccination was not effective for ILI prevention, nor for COVID-19. Nevertheless, it reduced ILI complications, with no ILI-related deaths in vaccinated patients. We recommend the vaccine in ICI-treated cancer patients. Clinical trial identification: Eudract number of the trial: 2020-002603-18.

0	Anxiety and depression in cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single-centre study. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global mental health crisis. It has resulted in new sources of anxiety and depression among cancer patients which causes increasing psychological pressure. This study aimed at assessing the anxiety and depression in Tunisian cancer patients. Method(s): We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study between March and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients were screened using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A total of 91 patients replied to this survey. Result(s): From a total of 91 respondents in the study, there were 48 (52.7%) male patients and 43 (47.3%) female patients. 59 (64.8%) of the patients involved in this study were above 40 years of age, followed by 17(18.7%) of 20-29 years old and 15(16.5%) of 30-39 years old. About marital status, 67(73.6%) were married, 5 (5.5%) divorced, 4(4.4%) widowed and 15 (16.5%) were single. The incidence of depression under novel coronavirus pandemic in cancer patients was 29.7% (27/91). Eighteen (66.7%) had mild depression, 7(25.9%) moderate depression and two (7.4%) severe depression. The incidence of anxiety was 69.2% (63/91).Of those patients, 42(66.7%) were experiencing mild anxiety, 12(19%) moderate anxiety and 9(14.3%) severe anxiety. Univariate analysis showed that asthenia, family support and pain were associated with anxiety (p=0.006, p=0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). Multivariate analysis of logistic regression revealed that family support during the COVID-19 pandemic was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (p=0.01). Presence of pain was associated with anxiety (OR= 4.106; 95%CI, 1.011-16.672; p=0.048). There were no significant relationships between depression and sex, family support, type of cancer or pain. Conclusion(s): This study provided evidence of high rates of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Family support reduces the risk of anxiety while, presence of pain increases that risk. Legal entity responsible for the study: Dr feryel Letaief KSONTINI. Funding(s): Has not received any funding.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced dramatic changes to the healthcare systems throughout the world. Time-sensitive management of cardiovascular emergencies such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has yet to be evaluated in the context of these new policies, particularly in so-called ""hot spot"" cities. Method(s): We evaluated the early impact of the pandemic on STEMI performance in the Greater Montreal Area. A total of 167 patients from 3 different study periods were included. Patients presenting in the lockdown period from mid-March to mid-May 2020 (Group C, 53 patients) were compared to those from mid-March to mid-May 2019 (Group A, 60 patients) and the 2020 pre-COVID-19 period (Group B, 54 patients). Result(s): The number of STEMI admissions was unaffected during the lockdown. However, significantly longer delays between symptom onset and first medical contact (FMC) were noted (Group C 189.0 IQR [70.0, 840.0] min vs. Group A 103.0 IQR [42.5, 263.0] min vs. Group B 91.0 IQR [38.0, 235.5 min], P = 0.007). In contrast, additional safety protocols do not appear to have significantly affected delays between FMC and first intracoronary device activation (Group C 102 IQR [73.0, 133.0] min vs. Group A 104 IQR [87.0, 146.0] min vs. Group B 99.5 IQR [80.0, 150.0] min, P = 0.37). Patients that presented during the outbreak were more likely to be unstable with a higher incidence of Killip classes II-IV compared to groups A and B (28.3% vs. 18.3% vs. 5.6% respectively, P = 0.008). Worse in-hospital outcomes were also noted with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (Group A 5.0% vs. Group B 11.1% vs. Group C 22.6%, P = 0.007). Conclusion(s): During the lockdown period, many patients appear to have been reluctant to present to hospitals. This was associated with more unstable STEMI presentations and worse in-hospital course. Importantly, the health care system appears able to ensure timely acute cardiac care while ensuring that COVID-19 protocols are respected.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc."	false

0	COVID-19 in people living with HIV: Clinical implications of dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Little evidence on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people living with HIV (PLWH) is currently available. We reported clinical and viroimmunological data of all HIV-positive patients admitted to our center with COVID-19 from March 1 to May 12, 2020. Overall, five patients were included: all were virologically-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ count was greater than 350 cell/mm3 in all but two patients. Although all patients had evidence of pneumonia on admission, only one developed respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was never detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in two patients, whereas in the others, viral clearance occurred within a maximum of 43 days. Immunoglobulin G production was elicited in all patients and neutralizing antibodies in all but one patient. Specific-T-cell response developed in all patients but was stronger in those with the more severe presentations. Similarly, the highest level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in the only patient experiencing respiratory failure. Despite a mild presentation, patients with more pronounced immunosuppression showed high degrees of both cytokines production and immune activation. Our study did not find an increased risk and severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. Adaptative cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to correlate to disease severity. The mild clinical picture showed in advanced HIV patients, despite a significant T-cell activation and inflammatory profile, suggests a potential role of HIV-driven immunological dysregulation in avoiding immune-pathogenetic processes. However, other possible explanations, as a protective role of certain antiretroviral drugs, should be considered. Further larger studies are needed to better clarify the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"Asymptomatic carriage rates and case-fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff in Irish nursing homes. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately affected nursing homes (NH). In Ireland, the first NH case COVID-19 occurred on 16/03/2020. A national point-prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place (18/04/2020-05/05/2020). AIMS: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations (CHOs), proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom-profile, and resident case-fatality. METHOD(S): Forty-five NHs surveyed requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020-22/05/2020. RESULT(S): Surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1741): 40.8% (710/1741) laboratory-confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic, and 3.1% (54/1741) clinically-suspected. Resident case-fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with ""early-stage"" (<28 days) versus ""later-stage"" outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in ""early"" outbreak NHs had recovered compared to those with ""late"" outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; chi2=56.9, P<0.001). Of 395 NH staff across twelve sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho=0.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the NH sector. Systematic point-prevalence testing is necessary to reduce risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and manage outbreaks in this setting.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	A 63-year-old woman with sars-cov-2 infection, who developed severe covid-19 pneumonia and was supported with convalescent plasma therapy. Patient: Female, 63-year-old Final Diagnosis: COVID-19 Symptoms: Cough * fever Medication: - Clinical Procedure: PCR * plasma exchange * serology Specialty: Infectious Diseases Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusion(s): Unusual clinical course There is no evidence-based treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was treated with convalescent plasma. A 63-year-old woman who presented with severe and prolonged course of COVID-19 disease (fever up to 39.4degreeC, persistent cough, and dyspnea) received a convalescent plasma transfusion, which led to complete recovery. The diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR testing using the CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, USA) from naso-pharyngeal swabs. In laboratory tests, an increase in acute-phase parameters was observed. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed abnormalities typical for COVID-19. On days 9 and 11 of the disease, she received the convalescent plasma prepared from a single plasmapheresis donation from a male donor. This male donor was qualified as a convalescent plasma donor according to Polish guidelines, which are compliant with European guidelines. He donated plasma at the Regional Centre for Transfusion Medicine in Bialystok, Poland. The therapy with convalescent plasma led to clinical improvement and normalization of inflammatory parameters. This report presents a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a 63-year-old woman who was given supportive treatment with convalescent plasma. Ongoing clinical trials will determine whether convalescent plasma therapy is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © Am J Case Rep, 2020.	false
0	A 63-year-old woman with a history of nonhodgkin lymphoma with persistent sars-cov-2 infection who was seronegative and treated with convalescent plasma. Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusion(s): Unusual clinical course This is a case report of an immunocompromised patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who was seronegative and successfully treated with convalescent plasma. A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission while on maintenance therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over 12 weeks and persistently tested seronegative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. During this time, the patient experienced waxing and waning of symptoms, which included fever, myalgia, and non-productive cough, but never acquired severe respiratory distress. She was admitted to our hospital on illness day 88, and her symptoms resolved after the administration of convalescent plasma. As the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, we can currently only speculate about the occurrence of chronic infection vs. reinfection. The protective role of antibodies and their longevity against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Since humoral immunity has an integral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, various phase 3 vaccine trials are underway. In the context of this pandemic, the present case demonstrates the challenges in our understanding of testing and treating immunocompromised patients.Copyright © Am J Case Rep, 2020.	false
0	Selenium and selenoproteins in viral infection with potential relevance to COVID-19. Selenium is a trace element essential to human health largely because of its incorporation into selenoproteins that have a wide range of protective functions. Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host. That finding suggests that redox-active selenium species formed at high selenium intake might hypothetically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We consider the tactics that SARS-CoV-2 could employ to evade an adequate host response by interfering with the human selenoprotein system. Recognition of the myriad mechanisms by which selenium might potentially benefit COVID-19 patients provides a rationale for randomised, controlled trials of selenium supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false

0	Association of immune checkpoint inhibitors with respiratory infections: A review. Treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown efficacy against a variety of cancer types. The use of anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, and anti CTLA-4 antibodies is rapidly expanding. The side effects of ICIs are very different from conventional cytocidal anticancer and molecular target drugs, and may extend to the digestive organs, respiratory organs, thyroid gland, pituitary gland, skin, and others. Although the details of these adverse events are becoming increasingly apparent, much is unknown regarding the effects and adverse events related to infections. This review focuses specifically on the impact of ICIs on respiratory infections. The impact of ICIs on pathogens varies depending on the significance of the role of T-cell immunity in the immune response to the specific pathogen, as well as the different modes of infection (i.e., acute or chronic), although the impact of ICIs on the clinical outcome of infections in humans has not yet been well studied. Enhanced clearance of many pathogens has been shown because immune checkpoint inhibition activates T cells. In contrast, reactivation of tuberculosis associated with ICI use has been reported, and therefore caution is warranted. In COVID-19 pneumonia, ICI administration may lead to exacerbation; however, it is also possible that ICI may be used for the treatment of COVID-19. It has also been shown that ICI has potential in the treatment of intractable filamentous fungal infections. Therefore, expanded clinical applications are expected.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 on cardio-obstetric risk indicators: Future directions. Cardiovascular illness is one the foremost causes of death in females. The goal of preventive medicine is to identify and target high-risk females belonging to the younger age group in order to prevent future onset of cardiovascular pathologies. Certain obstetric complications like idiopathic preterm birth, preeclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes and abruptio placentae mark their presence in the checklist of risk indicators for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among the female population. Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome-1 (SARS-1) infections recorded a significant impact on maternal and fetal outcomes. In this article, we aim to focus on the incidence of cardiovascular risk indicators with the incessant novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in pregnant women and to provide recommendations for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in infected females. As the disease is novel and gradually unfolding to clinicians globally, the data and the publications are also evolving. Studies on COVID-19 in pregnancy has shown an increase in the number of preterm births, and PE with some reports on vertical transmission, but no significant increase in miscarriage, still births and teratogenicity. Preterm births appear more likely to be iatrogenic rather than idiopathic, owing to severity of infection or maternal/fetal safety. Causal association of virus with PE needs further analysis by large population studies, as both have common overlapping clinical and laboratory parameters. Direct placental involvement by virus leading on to PE or infection itself simulating PE needs further explication. Assessment of placental function, histopathological examination, and measurement of antiangiogenic factors are some of the suggested measures to differentiate further. Peripartum cardiomyopathy in COVID-19 positive pregnant females has not yet been actively explored, particularly in cases of clinical deterioration. Practical utilization of handheld point-of-care echocardiography machines stand in need for diagnosing myocardial dysfunction in this pandemic. COVID-19 infection and pregnancy together may impart a greater thromboembolism risk due to their inherent hypercoagulable states. All pregnant females with COVID-19 infection are candidates for VTE prophylaxis, both antepartum and postpartum depending on the severity of illness.Copyright © 2020 American Medical Association.

0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital emergency departments: Results of a survey of departments in 2020 - The Spanish encovur study. Objective. To estimate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the organization of Spanish hospital emergency departments (EDs). To explore differences between Spanish autonomous communities or according to hospital size and disease incidence in the area. Methods. Survey of the heads of 283 EDs in hospitals belonging to or affiliated with Spain's public health service. Respondents evaluated the pandemic's impact on organization, resources, and staff absence from work in March and April 2020. Assessments were for 15-day periods. Results were analyzed overall and by autonomous community, hospital size, and local population incidence rates. Results. A total of 246 (87%) responses were received. The majority of the EDs organized a triage system, first aid, and observation wards; areas specifically for patients suspected of having COVID-19 were newly set apart. The nursing staff was increased in 83% of the EDs (with no subgroup differences), and 59% increased the number of physicians (especially in large hospitals and locations where the COVID-19 incidence was high). Diagnostic tests for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were the resource the EDs missed most: 55% reported that tests were scarce often or very often. Other resources reported to be scarce were FPP2 and FPP3 masks (38% of the EDs), waterproof protective gowns (34%), and space (32%). More than 5% of the physicians, nurses, or other emergency staff were on sick leave 20%, 19%, and 16% of the time. These deficiencies were greatest during the last half of March, except for tests, which were most scarce in the first 15 days. Large hospital EDs less often reported that diagnostic tests were unavailable. In areas where the COVID-19 incidence was higher, the EDs reported higher rates of staff on sick leave. Resource scarcity differed markedly by autonomous community and was not always associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the population. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic led to organizational changes in EDs. Certain resources became scarce, and marked differences between autonomous communities were detected.Copyright © 2020, Saned.

0	"COVID-19 RESPIRATORY MECHANICS FEASIBILITY IN HOMELESS QUARANTINE. SESSION TITLE: Global Case Report Posters SESSION TYPE: Global Case Reports PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: In Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Wuhan, 20-41% developed lung disease including ARDS with a mortality rate of almost 50% 1 Traditional methods of monitoring lung infection such as CT scan, Ultrasound, and X-ray are infeasible at scale, especially due to the risks of cross-contamination. Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) may provide a quick, inexpensive, and simple way (logistics and minimal patient effort) to monitor COVID-19 patients at home or point-of-care settings. FOT measures lung mechanics with tidal, rested breathing, and does not require patient training. FOT measures respiratory impedance, a combination of resistance (openness of the airways) and reactance (elasticity of the airways) at different frequencies (denoting small vs large airways). Assessment of lung mechanics has been shown as a predictor for ARDS and acute lung injury (ALI) and may be crucial for early intervention for COVID-19 patients2-3. Characterization as Symptomatic, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered is insufficient for patients discharged to home or holding facilities and inadequately gathers information to describe the course, risk of deterioration, and lung recovery. Pulse oximetry alone is insufficient in the face of the ""happy hypoxic"". CASE PRESENTATION: Homeless patients are followed by Public Health and quarantined at a motel for monitoring.We used a portable FOT device, PulmoScan (Cognita Labs, USA), to measure respiratory mechanical impedance of COVID-19 patients and assess the feasibility for monitoring at home or point-of-care settings. COVID-19 patients (male, age 45-55) were recruited from a homeless shelter at Oxnard, CA, USA, for daily lung function monitoring using PulmoScan. A single device was used to monitor multiple patients during daily testing routines by taking adequate precautions, personal protection equipment, and anti-viral, anti-bacterial filters were used. The parameters were resistances and reactances at frequencies 5-30Hz (R5-R30, X5-X30), small airway resistance (R5-R20), resonant frequency (fres), and area under reactance (AX). DISCUSSION: Both patients were asymptomatic throughout the duration of the study. However, the respiratory impedance was consistently higher in the first 5 days compared to the last 5 days of recovery. On average, the following parameters were higher- R5(patient 1 by 16%, patient 2 by 17%), R10 (12%,10%), R15 (12%,9%), R20 (10%,9%), R25 (8%,9%), R30 (6%,9%), R5-R20 (291%,138%), AX (37%,54%), and fres (18%,21%), and the following were lower- X5 (17%,32%), X10 (41%,72%), X15 (80%,102%), X20 (36%,57%), X25 (16%,33%) and X30 (10%,24%) on the first 5 days compared to the last 5 days. CONCLUSION(S): Monitoring COVID-19 patients using FOT is feasible in the point-of-care setting for daily tracking. The changes in lung mechanics measured through FOT shows early promise as a method for tracking lung deterioration.

0	Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Antibody Interactions. The 2019 coronavirus pandemic remains a major public health concern. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) represent a cutting-edge antiviral strategy. We focus here on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, and discuss current progress in antibody research against rampant SARS-CoV-2 infections. We provide a perspective on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-derived nAbs, comparing these with existing SARS-CoV-derived antibodies. We offer insight into how these antibodies cross-react and cross-neutralize by analyzing available structures of spike (S) glycoprotein-antibody complexes. We also propose ways of adopting antibody-based strategies - such as cocktail antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 - to overcome the possible resistance of currently identified mutants and mitigate possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) pathologies. This review provides a platform for the progression of antibody and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2, and possibly against future coronavirus pandemics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Increasing incidence of complicated appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic. Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) strain has resulted in restrictions potentially impacting patients presenting with acute appendicitis and their disease burden. Method(s): All acute appendicitis admissions (281 patients) between 1/1/2018-4/30/2020 were reviewed. Two groups were created: 6 weeks before (Group A) and 6 weeks after (Group B) the date elective surgeries were postponed in Massachusetts for COVID-19. Acute appendicitis incidence and disease characteristics were compared between the groups. Similar time periods from 2018 to 2019 were also compared. Result(s): Fifty-four appendicitis patients were categorized in Group A and thirty-seven in Group B. Those who underwent surgery were compared and revealed a 45.5% decrease (CI: 64.2,-26.7) in uncomplicated appendicitis, a 21.1% increase (CI:3.9,38.3) in perforated appendicitis and a 29% increase (CI:11.5,46.5) in gangrenous appendicitis. Significant differences in the incidence of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were also noted when comparing 2020 to previous years. Conclusion(s): The significant increase in complicated appendicitis and simultaneous significant decrease in uncomplicated appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that patients are not seeking appropriate, timely surgical care.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in an Adolescent that Developed Coronary Aneurysms: A Case Report and Review of the Literature. Background: A small subset of pediatric patients develop a rare syndrome associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). This syndrome shares characteristics with Kawasaki disease. Case Report: A 15-year-old girl presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with fevers and malaise. She was diagnosed on her initial visit with an acute viral syndrome and discharged with a COVID polymerase chain reaction test pending, which was subsequently negative. She returned 3 days later with persistent fever, conjunctivitis, and a symmetric targetoid rash over her palms. She had no adenopathy, but her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both significantly elevated at 90 mm/h and 19.61 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was then transferred to the regional children's hospital due to a clinical suspicion for MIS-C, and subsequent COVID-19 immunoglobulin G testing was positive. She had been empirically started on intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to 81 mg aspirin daily. Initial echocardiograms showed mild dilatation of the left main coronary artery, and on repeat echocardiogram, a right coronary artery aneurysm was also identified. Oral prednisone therapy (5 mg) was initiated and the patient was discharged on a continued prednisone taper. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: We present a case of a 15-year-old girl who presented to the ED with MIS-C who developed coronary aneurysms despite early therapy, to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this emerging condition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Long-term hydroxychloroquine use in patients with rheumatic conditions and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study. Background: Hydroxychloroquine is one of several agents being evaluated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding(s): Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10 703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21 406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [0.3%] of 10 703 vs 78 [0.4%] of 21 406; odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.20, p=0.27). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. For all patients in the study, overall mortality was lower in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the group of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.89, p=0.0031). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, receipt of hydroxychloroquine was not associated with the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.51-1.42). Interpretation(s): Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a preventive effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large group of patients with rheumatological conditions.

0	Risk of COVID-19-related death among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma prescribed inhaled corticosteroids: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform. Background: Early descriptions of patients admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a lower prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than would be expected for an acute respiratory disease like COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) might protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the development of serious sequelae. We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. Method(s): In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting beta agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA-LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA-LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. Finding(s): We identified 148 557 people with COPD and 818 490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA-LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 1.39 [95% CI 1.10-1.76]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (1.55 [1.10-2.18]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (1.14 [0.85-1.54]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 1.43). Interpretation(s): Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

0	Identifying pathophysiological bases of disease in COVID-19. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that can affect lung physiology encompassing a wide spectrum of severities, ranging from asymptomatic and mild symptoms to severe and fatal cases; the latter including massive neutrophil infiltration, stroke and multiple organ failure. Despite many recents findings, a clear mechanistic description underlying symptomatology is lacking. In this article, we thoroughly review the available data involving risk factors, age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms of disease, cellular and molecular mechanisms and the details behind host/pathogen interaction that hints at the existence of different pathophysiological mechanisms of disease. There is clear evidence that, by targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) -its natural receptor-, SARS-CoV-2 would mainly affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), whose imbalance triggers diverse symptomatology-associated pathological processes. Downstream actors of the RAAS cascade are identified, and their interaction with risk factors and comorbidities are presented, rationalizing why a specific subgroup of individuals that present already lower ACE2 levels is particularly more susceptible to severe forms of disease. Finally, the notion of endotype discovery in the context of COVID-19 is introduced. We hypothesize that COVID-19, and its associated spectrum of severities, is an umbrella term covering different pathophysiological mechanisms (endotypes). This approach should dramatically accelerate our understanding and treatment of disease(s), enabling further discovery of pathophysiological mechanisms and leading to the identification of specific groups of patients that may benefit from personalized treatments.

0	Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol-induced blackout tweets. INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: COVID-19, considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization, overwhelmed hospitals in the USA. In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol-induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol-induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID-19 outbreak., DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol-related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts., RESULTS: More alcohol-related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the 'stay at home' orders (January to mid-March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that references to high-risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID-19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID-19, and alcohol-related mortality can further tax hospital resources.

0	An Epidemiologic Study of COVID-19 Patients in a State Psychiatric Hospital: High Penetrance With Early CDC Guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the transmission of COVID-19 in a U.S. state psychiatric hospital setting., METHODS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested throughout a large psychiatric hospital to determine penetrance. The hospital followed initial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines., RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent (N=51 of 65) of tested patients in the building where the first positive patient was housed (building zero) tested positive for COVID-19. Eighty-eight percent (N=14 of 16) of tested asymptomatic patients in building zero were positive, compared with 12% (N=6 of 51) of randomly selected asymptomatic patients in a sample from the rest of the hospital., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of patients can become positive for COVID-19 despite following initial CDC guidelines. As such, use of masks by all patients in close-quarter settings prior to the first positive case appears warranted. Recent CDC guidelines align with this strategy.	false
0	Is extensive cardiopulmonary screening useful in athletes with previous asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection?. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to understand if and how to screen SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes to safely resume training and competitions. The aim of this study is to understand which investigations are useful in a screening protocol aimed at protecting health but also avoiding inappropriate examinations., METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of a professional soccer team that is based on an extensive screening protocol for resuming training during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included personal history, antigen swabs, blood tests, spirometry, resting/stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring, echocardiogram, Holter and chest CT. We also compared the findings with prior data from the same subjects before infection and with data from SARS-CoV-2-negative players., RESULTS: None of the players had positive swab and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM class antibodies. Out of 30 players, 18 (60%) had IgG class antibodies. None had suffered severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease, 12 (66.7%) had complained of mild COVID-19-related symptoms and 6 (33.3%) were asymptomatic. None of the players we examined revealed significant cardiovascular abnormalities after clinical recovery. A mild reduction in spirometry parameters versus pre-COVID-19 values was observed in all athletes, but it was statistically significant (p<0.05) only in SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes. One SARS-CoV-2-positive player showed increased troponin I level, but extensive investigation did not show signs of myocardial damage., CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of athletes with previous asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive screening protocol including blood tests, spirometry, resting ECG, stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring and echocardiogram did not identify relevant anomalies. While larger studies are needed, extensive cardiorespiratory and haematological screening in athletes with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unnecessary.

0	Potential limitations in COVID-19 machine learning due to data source variability: a case study in the nCov2019 dataset. OBJECTIVE: Lack of representative COVID-19 data is a bottleneck for reliable and generalizable machine learning. Data sharing is insufficient without data quality, where source variability plays an important role. We showcase and discuss potential biases from data source variability for COVID-19 machine learning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the publicly available nCov2019 dataset, including patient level data from several countries. We aimed to the discovery and classification of severity subgroups using symptoms and comorbidities., RESULTS: Cases from the two countries with the highest prevalence were divided into separate subgroups with distinct severity manifestations. This variability can reduce the representativeness of training data with respect the model target populations and increase model complexity at risk of overfitting., CONCLUSION: Data source variability is a potential contributor to bias in distributed research networks. We call for systematic assessment and reporting of data source variability and data quality in COVID-19 data sharing, as key information for reliable and generalizable machine learning.

0	Rapid review of early status of COVID-19 infection in South Korea. Since the confirmation of the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient on January 20 2020, COVID-19 infection rate ramped up between February and March in South Korea. This study aimed to provide information on the characteristics of the first two months of COVID-19 prevalence in South Korea and attempted to comprehend preliminary evidence from various sources. We used public data available from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention and situation reports from the World Health Organization from February to March 2020. For additional information, health utilization data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development was used for subgroup analysis. A proportion of meta-analysis was performed. We searched literatures from PubMed, KoreaMed, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) for identifying epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and treatment strategies. We monitored domestic and global disease control institutions' recommendations. The search results and reports were updated every two weeks. In South Korea, the ratio of confirmed cases is divided into two groups; before and after the occurrence of a large cluster infection explosion on February 17 2020 from a religious group called the Shincheonji Church. After the global pandemic announcement by World Health Organization on March 11 2020, the fatality rate of COVID-19 seems to be related to the number of beds and general hospitals. From the literature review, we identified a strong reproduction rate, asymptomatic period or infection, rate of exacerbation, and current treatments. The COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea was inevitable, but the early explosion of infection showed the decline curve afforded by the rigorous tracing, widespread testing, and well-organized health care system.Copyright © 2020 Korean Medical Association.

0	Investigation of the D614G mutation and antibody-dependent enhancement sequences in indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and comparison to southeast Asian isolates. Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading virus that poses a major burden on global human health and the economy. Therefore, it is essential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine construction might not be easy, as a consequence of mutations and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Objective(s): We first reported the D614G mutation and ADE sequences in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and compared these isolates to those from other Southeast Asian countries. Method(s): In this study, we extracted the SARS-CoV-2 genome of 40 Indonesian isolates from the GISAID EpiCoV database and the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (reference sequence) from GenBank, NCBI. We used BioEdit v7.2.5 to identify the D614G mutation and ADE sequences in the spike protein. Then, we rendered the spike protein using the SWISS-MODEL web server and PyMOL v2.4. Result(s): We identified the D614G missense mutation in 23 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and isolates from six other Southeast Asian countries. In addition, we identified the ADE sequence 611LYQDVNC617 in the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, which had changed into 611LYQGVNC617 in recent mutated isolates. Conclusion(s): We conclude that the D614G mutation might affect ADE activities. A rapid but cautious approach to the vaccine development and other therapies developed for COVID-19 seems needed until we have more data on the risks of the D614G mutation and ADE. However, further studies including in vitro and in vivo assessments are relevant for validation of these results.Copyright © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.	false
0	Sex difference in coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the sex difference in the prevalence of COVID-19 confirmed cases., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis., SETTING: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for related information. The authors developed a data extraction form on an Excel sheet and the following data from eligible studies were extracted: author, country, sample size, number of female patients and number of male patients. Using STATA V.14 for analysis, the authors pooled the overall prevalence of men and/or women using a random-effect meta-analysis model. The authors examined the heterogeneity in effect size using Q statistics and I2 statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was also checked., PARTICIPANTS: Studies on COVID-19 confirmed cases were included., INTERVENTION: Sex (male/female) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was considered., PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 among men and women., RESULTS: A total of 57 studies with 221 195 participants were used in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among men was found to be 55.00 (51.43-56.58, I2=99.5%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed the findings were not dependent on a single study. Moreover, a funnel plot showed symmetrical distribution. Egger's regression test p value was not significant, which indicates absence of publication bias in both outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be higher in men than in women. The high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption contributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 among men. Additional studies on the discrepancies in severity and mortality rate due to COVID-19 among men and women and the associated factors are recommended.

0	Metastatic pulmonary dissemination as differential diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. A 13-year-old boy presented to hospital with 3-day self-limited fever, followed by dry cough, persistent asthenia and impaired general condition of 2 weeks' duration. Blood analyses showed a severe inflammatory status and chest X-ray images were consistent with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed an acute respiratory failure that required paediatric intensive care admission and non-invasive ventilation. A targeted COVID-19 treatment was initiated with hydroxicloroquine, corticosteroids, enoxaparine and a single dose of tocilizumab. Repeated serological tests and real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Other infectious pathogens were also ruled out. Thoracic high resolution CT showed an intense bilateral pulmonary dissemination with lytic vertebral bone lesions. After diagnostic investigations, Ewing's sarcoma with metastatic pulmonary dissemination was diagnosed. Nowadays, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 community pandemic, we cannot forget that COVID-19 clinical presentation is not specific and other entities can mimic its clinical features.

0	Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19: Systematic review with meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The mortality rate associated with Covid-19 varies considerably among studies and determinants of this variability are not well characterized., METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published through March 31, 2020 was performed to estimate the mortality rate among hospitalized patients in China with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19. Hospital mortality rates were estimated using an inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. Funnel plot symmetry was evaluated for small-study effects, a one-study removed sensitivity analysis assessed the influence of individual studies on the pooled mortality rate, and metaregression assessed the association of potential confounding variables with mortality rates., RESULTS: The review included 16 observational studies involving 1832 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19. The surveillance period among studies ranged from December 16, 2019 to February 23, 2020. The median patient age was 53 years and 53% were males. A total of 38.5% of patients presented with at least 1 comorbidity, most commonly hypertension (24.0%), cardiac disease (15.1%), and diabetes mellitus (14.4%). Fever and cough, reported in 84.8% and 61.7% of patients respectively, were the most common patient symptoms. The pooled mortality rate was 9.9% (95% confidence interval 6.1% to 14.5%). Funnel plot asymmetry was not observed and the meta-analysis results were not substantially influenced by any single study since the pooled mortality rate ranged from 8.9% to 11.1% following iterative removal of one study at a time. Substantial heterogeneity in the mortality rate was identified among studies (I = 87%; P < .001). In a metaregression that included demographics, patient risk factors, and presenting symptoms, only a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher mortality rate (P = .03)., CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of hospitalized patients in China with a diagnosis of Covid-19, the mortality rate was 9.9% and a higher diabetes mellitus prevalence was independently associated with a worse prognosis. The independent influence of diabetes mellitus with Covid-19 mortality should be viewed as hypothesis-generating and warrants further study.	false
0	Role of a Pediatric Cardiologist in the COVID-19 Pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected patients across all age groups, with a wide range of illness severity from asymptomatic carriers to severe multi-organ dysfunction and death. Although early reports have shown that younger age groups experience less severe disease than older adults, our understanding of this phenomenon is in continuous evolution. Recently, a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), with active or recent COVID-19 infection, has been increasingly reported. Children with MIS-C may demonstrate signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease, but also have some distinct differences. These children have more frequent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms and are more likely to present with a shock-like presentation. Moreover, they often present with cardiovascular involvement including myocardial dysfunction, valvulitis, and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms. Here, we present a review of the literature and summary of our current understanding of cardiovascular involvement in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C and identifying the role of a pediatric cardiologist in caring for these patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false

0	Stroke Thrombectomy in Patients with COVID-19: Initial Experience in 13 Cases. We performed a retrospective review in both comprehensive stroke units of a region affected early by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, between March 1 and April 26, 2020, including patients with COVID-19 who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for ischemic stroke. We identified 13 cases, representing 38.2% of 34 thrombectomies performed during this period. We observed increased mortality and a high incidence of thrombotic complications during hospitalization. Given the high rate of infected patients, systematic use of full personal protection measures seems justified.Copyright © 2020 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.	false

0	Personal Protective Equipment in the Paediatric Emergency Department during the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating requirements based on staff numbers and patient presentations. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required in a Paediatric Emergency Department during the COVID-19 pandemic comparing the use per patient to use per patient zone, based on the NSW Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC) guidelines in place at the time of the study., METHODS: A retrospective case note review of all patients and staff present in the emergency department of The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia in the 24hour period of Sunday 5th April 2020. The primary outcome of PPE estimates was generated from identifying the number of patient contacts and aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) performed per patient as well as the number of staff on shift., RESULTS: One hundred patients attended the ED (50% of usual) and all were included in the study. For a low risk community environment allocating PPE per patient contact required 48 face shields, 382 surgical masks, 48 N95 masks and 430 gowns for the day, increasing to 430 face shields, 331 surgical masks, 430 N95 masks and 761 gowns in a high-risk community environment. Allocating PPE using zoning reduces the requirement to 48 face shields, 192 surgical masks, 48 N95 masks and 204 gowns, increasing to 196 face shields, 96 surgical masks, 196 N95 masks and 292 gowns per day in a high-risk community environment., CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the considerable requirement for PPE in a Paediatric ED, which varies according to presentation type and the background prevalence of COVID-19 in the community.

0	Coagulation parameters and venous thromboembolism in patients with and without COVID-19 admitted to the Emergency Department for acute respiratory insufficiency. BACKGROUND: In the recent outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, increased D-dimer levels and high rates of venous thromboembolic events were reported. We aimed to compare coagulation parameters on admission between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory insufficiency and to describe VTE diagnosed at entry., METHODS: In this single-centre, observational retrospective study consecutive patients admitted for fever and acute respiratory failure were included. Patients underwent laboratory tests, arterial blood gas, chest X-ray, point of care ultrasound (POCUS), limited compression ultrasonography of the lower limbs (L-CUS), chest CT-scan if necessary, and swab test for COVID-19., RESULTS: Of 324 patients, 50% had COVID-19. COVID19 patients had significantly lower mean white blood cells, neutrophils, platelet count, and pCT values, and significantly higher CRP, LDH, and ferritin levels than non-COVID19 patients. D-dimer was increased in 86.5% COVID19 patients and in 84.9% non-COVID19 patients; mean values were similar (2185 ng/mL and 2814 ng/mL, respectively, p = n.s.). After multivariate analysis, results were unchanged (Odds Ratio 1.00 95%CI: 0.99-1.00, p = 0.21). PT and aPTT values were also similar between the two groups, fibrinogen levels were higher in COVID19 than in non-COVID19 patients (684 and 496 mg/dL, respectively, p < 0.0001). Five patients had asymptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis detected by L-CUS (3 COVID19) and 2 patients had symptomatic pulmonary embolism (both non-COVID19)., CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer levels were similarly increased in patients with and without SARS-CoV 2 related disease. There were few cases of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis or symptomatic pulmonary embolism at first day of admission, similarly distributed between COVID19 patients and non-COVID19 patients.

0	Dexamethasone, pro-resolving lipid mediators and resolution of inflammation in COVID-19. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Since the beginning of 2020, it has become one of the main challenges of our times, causing a high incidence of severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure and death1 . At the root of COVID-19 lies the sudden development of 'cytokine storms', hyper-inflammatory responses involving the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, and MCP-1) that impair the gas exchange function of the lung and lead in select patients, mostly with underlying comorbidities, to multiorgan failure and death.

0	Clinical characteristics and humoral immune response in Healthcare Workers with COVID-19 in a Teaching Hospital in Belgium. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 and could play a role in nosocomial transmission. Since February 4, 2020, Belgian Health authorities reported more than 90568 cases, of which 8.3% were HCWs. Data on clinical characteristics, sources of infection and humoral immune response of HCWs with COVID-19 remain scarce., AIM: Analyse the clinical characteristics, humoral immune response, sources of contamination, and outcomes among HCWs with COVID-19., METHODS: This retrospective study includes 176 HCWs with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a teaching hospital in Belgium. Between March 1st, and May 31th 2020, all HCWs with symptoms suspect of COVID-19 were tested through a RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Serological testing was performed between 55 and 137 days after the onset of symptoms., FINDINGS: Median age was 40.8 years and 75% were female. Median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 4.39 days. Most frequent symptoms were cough and headache (75% respectively). Fever accounted for 68.7%. Most represented professions were nurses (42%). HCWs were mainly infected by patient contact (32.9%). 7.6% required hospitalization and 1.7% were admitted in intensive care unit. Unfortunately, one HCW died (0.5 %). Total antibodies were positive in 109/126 (86.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in HCWs does not differ from the general population. However outcomes were more favourable with a mortality rate lower than that reported in Belgian COVID-19 patients in general (16%). The main source of infection was the hospital settings. Our positive antibodies rate was high but lower than what was reported. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) may complicate the course of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of VTE in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched up to 24th June 2020 for studies that evaluated the incidence of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI) were calculated by random-effect meta-analysis., RESULTS: 3487 patients from 30 studies were included. Based on very low-quality evidence due to heterogeneity and risk of bias, the incidence of VTE was 26% (95% PI, 6%-66%). PE with or without DVT occurred in 12% of patients (95% PI, 2%-46%) and DVT alone in 14% (95% PI, 1%-75%). Studies using standard algorithms for clinically suspected VTE reported PE in 13% of patients (95% PI, 2%-57%) and DVT in 6% (95% PI, 0%-60%), compared to 11% (95% PI, 2%-46%) and 24% (95% PI, 2%-85%) in studies using other diagnostic strategies or patient sampling. In patients admitted to intensive care units, VTE occurred in 24% (95% PI, 5%-66%), PE in 19% (95% PI, 6%-47%), and DVT alone in 7% (95% PI, 0%-69%). Corresponding values in general wards were respectively 9% (95% PI, 0%-94%), 4% (95% PI, 0%-100%), and 7% (95% CI, 1%-49%)., CONCLUSIONS: VTE represents a frequent complication in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and often occurs as PE. The threshold for clinical suspicion should be low to trigger prompt diagnostic testing. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	false
0	Transmammary transmission of Troglostrongylus brevior feline lungworm: a lesson from our gardens. Feline lungworms such as Aerulostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are snail-borne pathogens causing respiratory disease in domestic cats. Paratenic hosts such as rodents and reptiles have also been implicated in the epidemiology of these parasites. Although A. abstrusus has been recognized for a long time as the most prevalent lungworm among cats worldwide, T. brevior is of major concern in kittens. Bearing in mind that disease due to T. brevior occurs mainly in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age, the diagnosis of this parasite in two kittens presenting severe respiratory disease from the garden of one of the authors inspired us to investigate the potential routes of transmission for T. brevior in domestic cats. Of the three queens (A, B and C) that delivered kittens (n=8), only cat A was positive for T. brevior, presenting her two kittens severe respiratory clinical signs, which lead to the exitus in one of them, 18 days of age. In addition, three kittens, the offspring of queen B, turned to be positive at the coprological examination after suckling from queen A, whereas those from queen C (that suckled only on their own mother) remained negative. A series of coprological, histological and molecular tests were conducted to confirm the presence of T. brevior in the patients as well as in the other cats cohabiting the same garden. Adult nematodes were retrieved from the trachea and bronchi of the dead kitten (kitten 1A), and larvae at the histology of the lung and liver parenchyma associated with bronco pneumonitis and lymphocytic pericholangitis, respectively. Cornu aspersum (n=60), Eobania vermiculata (n=30) snails (intermediate hosts) as well as lizards and rats (potential paratenic hosts) were collected from the same garden and processed through tissue digestion and molecular detection. Troglostrongylus brevior larvae were recovered through tissue digestion from two C. aspersum (3.33 %) and it was confirmed by PCR-sequencing approach, which also detected T. brevior DNA in the liver and lungs of one rat and in the coelomatic cavity of one gecko lizard. During the COVID-19 lockdown, when scientists spent more time at home, we grasp the opportunity to decipher T. brevior biology and ecology starting in a small ecological niche, such as the garden of our house. Data herein presented led us to suggest: i) the transmammary transmission of T. brevior in domestic cats; ii) the role of intermediate and paratenic hosts (including reptiles) in the epidemiology of the infection which they transmit; as well as iii) the importance of observational parasitology in studying any event that certainly occurs in small ecological niches, as it could be in our home gardens.

0	Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized pediatric and adult patients. Children and youth infected with SARS-CoV-2 have milder disease than do adults and, even among those with the recently described multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), mortality is rare. The reasons for the differences in clinical manifestations are unknown, but suggest that age-dependent factors may modulate the anti-viral immune response. We compared cytokine, humoral, and cellular immune responses in pediatric (children and youth, age < 24 years) (n=65) and adult (n=60) patients with COVID-19 at a metropolitan hospital system in New York City. The pediatric patients had a shorter length of stay, decreased requirement for mechanical ventilation and lower mortality compared to adults. The serum concentrations of IL-17A and IFN-gamma, but not TNF-alpha or IL-6, were inversely related to age. Adults mounted a more robust T cell response to the viral spike protein compared to pediatric patients as evidenced by increased expression of CD25+ on CD4+ T cells and the frequency of IFN-gamma+CD4+ T cells. Moreover, serum neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis were higher in adults compared to pediatric COVID-19 patients. The neutralizing antibody titer correlated positively with age and negatively with IL-17A and IFN-gamma serum concentrations. There were no differences in anti-spike protein antibody titers to other human coronaviruses. Together these findings demonstrate that the poor outcome in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 compared to children may not be attributable to a failure to generate adaptive immune responses.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted by reviewing charts and slides of placentas delivered between April 1 to July 24, 2020. Clinical history of ""COVID-19"" was searched in Pathology Database (CoPath). Controls were matched with SARS-CoV-2-negative women with singleton deliveries in the 3rd-trimester. Pathological features were extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one 3rd trimester placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and compared to 20 placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no significant differences in individual or group gross or microscopic pathological features. Within the SARS-CoV-2+ group, there are no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion:  Placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not demonstrate a specific pathological pattern. Pregnancy complicated with COVID-19 during the 3rd trimester does not have a demonstrable effect on placental structure and pathology."	false
0	Acute respiratory syndrome associated with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A threat to bronchial asthma in children and adult. The coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that may cause various symptoms such as pneumonia, fever, breathing difficulty, and lung infection. Theoretically, asthmatic patients should have increased susceptibility and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a deficient antiviral immune response and the tendency for exacerbation elicited by common respiratory viruses. However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. The interactions between COVID-19 and asthma deserve further attention and clarification.Copyright © 2020 Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Convalescent plasma therapy in severe coronavirus disease-2019: A narrative review. Passive immunotherapy using whole blood or plasma from recovered patients is a potential therapeutic strategy for infections with no known drug therapy or prophylactic vaccines. Much before, the concept of transfusing neutralizing antibodies through convalescent blood or plasma was established; this modality demonstrated its effectiveness in containing the havoc caused by diphtheria and tetanus during the early 20th century. Convalescent blood products were effective in reducing the mortality risk when administered early in the disease course during the deadliest pandemic of Spanish flu in 1918. Even in the antibiotic era, the use of passive immunization strategy continued to expand with promising results against measles, Ebola, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and Zika viruses. It was also effective in reducing the mortality and viral load in severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1, H1N1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Convalescent plasma administration carries the risk of anaphylactic reactions, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload, but these are extremely rare. The impact of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 is enormous with significant morbidity and mortality. Until, a specific antiviral therapy or an effective vaccine is made available, the consideration for use of convalescent blood products, especially plasma, is warranted. Conceptual and observational wisdom often blossoms among therapeutic penury. Copyright © 2020 Indian Journal of Rheumatology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.	false
0	Management options for gynecological cancers in low- To middle-income countries amidst COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Due to Covid-19 pandemic, the oncologists and cancer patients are in a dilemma, whether they should continue with the planned treatment or wait till the pandemic is over. This review is intended to explore the management options for gynaecological cancers during the pandemic. Data sources: We searched for literature from Pubmed database and oncological socities pertaining to the management of gynaecological cancers and Covid-19 pandemic. Study Selection: For such once in a century pandemic, there is a paucity of evidence based literature. Therefore, to address this issue all the available relevant studies were reviewed. Result(s): Definitely, a deviation from a standard care for a longer period i.e. beyond 4-6 weeks may lead to a significant impact on over all outcomes. As this current scenario is one of the first after the advent of modern medicine, there are no clear-cut evidence based suggestions to adopt for clinicians. Various organizations like NCCN, ACS, SGO, ESMO have suggested few recommendations for present situation. Here again, a role of multidisciplinary team is of pivotal importance and every case merits discussion by multi-disciplinary team (MDT) before finalizing a strategy. We share our perspective on the issue, which is based on currently available evidences as well as the practices we intend to follow at our centre. We agree that the quality of evidence remains of low grade and are mostly based on expert recommendations with an aim to tide over this period of around 4-12 weeks. Conclusion(s): Precise triage of patients will play a pivotal role in preserving resources and protecting health care workers and patients. The expertise at the respective oncology centres, prevalence/incidence of COVID-19 cases in that area, the support system of the hospital and the patient profile should direct the changes in practices. We also recommend that the standard therapy should be resumed as soon as the situation improves.

0	Brief communication: Immunohistochemical detection of ACE2 in human salivary gland. The novel, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was firstly reported in late December of 2019 and subsequently caused a global outbreak. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) as a cellular receptor for host cell entry through the surface unit of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. In this brief report, we analyze ACE2 protein expression and localization in human salivary gland, and propose a possible role of saliva in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

0	Liver transplantation in Italy in the era of COVID 19: reorganizing critical care of recipients. Transplant programs have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy was one of the first countries with the highest number of deaths in the world due to SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose a management model for the reorganization of liver transplant (LT) activities and policies in a local intensive care unit (ICU) assigned to liver transplantation affected by restrictions on mobility and availability of donors and recipients as well as health personnel and beds. We describe the solutions implemented to continue transplantation activities throughout a given pandemic: management of donors and recipients' LT program, ICU rearrangement, healthcare personnel training and monitoring to minimize mortality rates of patients on the waiting list. Transplantation activities from February 22, 2020, the data of first known COVID-19 case in Italy's Emilia Romagna region to June 30, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. During the 2020 study period, 38 LTs were performed, whereas 41 were performed in 2019. Patients transplanted during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher MELD and MELD-Na scores, cold ischaemia times, and hospitalization rates (p<0.05); accordingly, they spent fewer days on the waitlist and had a lower prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (p<0.05). No differences were found in the provenance area, additional MELD scores, age of donors and recipients, BMI, re-transplant rates, and post-transplant mortality. No transplanted patients contracted COVID-19, although five healthcare workers did. Ultimately, our policy allowed us to continue the ICU's operations by prioritizing patients hospitalized with higher MELD without any case of transplant infection due to COVID-19.	false
0	Leveraging mRNA Sequences and Nanoparticles to Deliver SARS-CoV-2 Antigens In Vivo. SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic worldwide; therefore, an effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5- to 10-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The antigen-specific antibodies induced by TT3-nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA-approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.	false

OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures., DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) asking: ""Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?"". Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating., SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13,829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over., RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past two weeks was 53.6%, with 11.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.6 - 12.6] of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating., CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focussed or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate."	false
0	Empirical assessment of government policies and flattening of the COVID19 curve. The objective of the study is 2-fold. First, it estimates the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID19) flattening curve using Panel Random Coefficient Model. This allows each country to have its trajectory while allowing for random error effects to transfer across countries. Second, it calculates the expected number of days to reach the flattening point of COVID19 curve and estimate the empirical effectiveness of government policies around the world using Poisson regression. This study avails global COVID19 incidence data for 190 countries between January 22, 2020 and May 11, 2020. In the absence of a vaccine or of more appropriate treatment options, non-pharmaceutical approaches must be used to control the spread of the COVID19. This study proposed that the contact tracing, stay at home restrictions and international movement restrictions are most effective in controlling the spread and flattening the COIVD19 curve. At the same time, habits that hurt the immune system like smoking have a negative effect on the flattening of the curve. The government should integrate these policies in their lockdown plan to make it smart lockdown. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Nailfold capillaroscopy findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: Broadening the spectrum of COVID-19 microvascular involvement. OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence points to endothelial dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). No specific methods have been identified to predict, detect and quantify the microvascular alterations during COVID-19. Our aim was to assess microvasculature through nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: We performed NVC in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Elementary alterations were reported for each finger according to a semi-quantitative score. Capillary density, number of enlarged and giant capillaries, number of micro-hemorrhages and micro-thrombosis (NEMO score) were registered., RESULTS: We enrolled 82 patients (mean age 58.8 +/- 13.2 years, male 68.3%) of whom 28 during the hospitalization and 54 after recovery and hospital discharge. At NVC examination we found abnormalities classifiable as non-specific pattern in 53 patients (64.6%). Common abnormalities were pericapillary edema (80.5%), enlarged capillaries (61.0%), sludge flow (53.7%), meandering capillaries and reduced capillary density (50.0%). No pictures suggestive of scleroderma pattern have been observed. Acute COVID-19 patients, compared to recovered patients, showed a higher prevalence of hemosiderin deposits as a result of micro-hemorrhages (P = .027) and micro-thrombosis (P < .016), sludge flow (P = .001), and pericapillary edema (P < .001), while recovered patients showed a higher prevalence of enlarged capillaries (P < .001), loss of capillaries (P = .002), meandering capillaries (P < .001), and empty dermal papillae (P = .006)., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients present microvascular abnormalities at NVC. Currently ill and recovered subjects are characterized by a different distribution of elementary capillaroscopic alterations, resembling acute and post-acute microvascular damage. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of NVC in COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the perinatal mental health of women. Short Communications The physical health impact of the coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) has received attention worldwide; however, data around the psychological impact of the pandemic is still emerging and little has been reported on psychological effects among vulnerable groups. This study was undertaken with the aim of studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on perinatal mental health among women in Qatar. Objectives and Methods A cross- sectional survey of women accessing maternity services in Qatar was carried out during the months of June and July 2020 at the local peak of the pandemic. Background data including relevant demographic details, pregnancy and mental health history, concerns, as well as helpful stress-reducing factors reported by women was collected. Depression and anxiety symptomatology was studied using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results The survey results revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and Depressive symptomatology (34.4 and 39.2% respectively), based on PHQ-ADS scoring. These rates appeared much higher than the reported pre-pandemic prevalence and were not affected by occupation, previous mental health problems or pregnancy complications. Women's most commonly reported concerns as well as coping factors are discussed. Conclusions Results indicate a marked increase in anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, among pregnant and puerperal individuals, who constitute a vulnerable group with respect to mental health morbidity. These findings can be used to inform public health interventions, among which, consideration should be given to routine mental health screening of vulnerable groups during major health crises.	false
0	"Rationing in a Pandemic: Lessons from Italy. In late February and early March 2020, Italy became the European epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite increasingly stringent containment measures enforced by the government, the health system faced an enormous pressure, and extraordinary efforts were made in order to increase overall hospital beds' availability and especially ICU capacity. Nevertheless, the hardest-hit hospitals in Northern Italy experienced a shortage of ICU beds and resources that led to hard allocating choices. At the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations aimed at supporting physicians in prioritizing patients when the number of critically ill patients overwhelm the capacity of ICUs. One motivating concern for the SIAARTI guidance was that, if no balanced and consistent allocation procedures were applied to prioritize patients, there would be a concrete risk for unfair choices, and that the prevalent ""first come, first served"" principle would lead to many avoidable deaths. Among the drivers of decision for admission to ICUs, age, comorbidities, and preexisting functional status were included. The recommendations were criticized as ageist and potentially discriminatory against elderly patients. Looking forward to the next steps, the Italian experience can be relevant to other parts of the world that are yet to see a significant surge of COVID-19: the need for transparent triage criteria and commonly shared values give the Italian recommendations even greater legitimacy.

0	Understanding COVID-19 transmission, health impacts and mitigation: timely social distancing is the key. COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, first identified in China and spread globally, resulting into pandemic. Transmission of virus takes place either directly through close contact with infected individual (symptomatic/asymptomatic) or indirectly by touching contaminated surfaces. Virus survives on the surfaces from few hours to days. It enters the human body through nose, eyes or mouth. Other sources of contamination are faeces, blood, food, water, semen etc. Parameters such as temperature/relative humidity also play an important role in transmission. As the disease is evolving, so are the number of cases. Proper planning and restriction are helping in influencing the trajectory of the transmission. Various measures are undertaken to prevent infection such as maintaining hygiene, using facemasks, isolation/quarantine, social/physical distancing, in extreme cases lockdown (restricted movement except essential services) in hot spot areas or throughout the country. Countries that introduced various mitigation measures had experienced control in transmission of COVID-19. Python programming is conducted for change point analysis (CPA) using Bayesian probability approach for understanding the impact of restrictions and mitigation methods in terms of either increase or stagnation in number of COVID-19 cases for eight countries. From analysis it is concluded that countries which acted late in bringing in the social distancing measures are suffering in terms of high number of cases with USA, leading among eight countries analysed. The CPA week in comparison with date of lockdown and first reported case strongly correlates (Pearson's r = - 0.86 to - 0.97) to cases, cases per unit area and cases per unit population, indicating earlier the mitigation strategy, lesser the number of cases. The overall paper will help the decision makers in understanding the possible steps for mitigation, more so in developing countries where the fight against COVID-19 seems to have just begun.

0	Nurse Leaders Advocate for Nurses Across a Health Care System: COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of nursing care globally. Nurses are the frontline staff in the care of individuals stricken with this highly infectious and deadly illness. Nurse leaders must advocate for nursing staff when staff are immersed in often overwhelming conditions. Through a case study, this article outlines how one healthcare system's Chief Nursing Officer council worked collaboratively, jointly and with the Emergency Incident Command Structure, to operationalize CDC guidelines and support, protect, educate, and empower staff. These initiatives resulted in creative solutions, technological advances for the system, and nursing staff and leaders rising to the challenge. Copyright 2020 by Elsevier Inc.

0	The Clinical Frailty Scale: Estimating the Prevalence of Frailty in Older Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19. The COPE Study. Frailty assessed using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a good predictor of adverse clinical events including mortality in older people. CFS is also an essential criterion for determining ceilings of care in people with COVID-19. Our aims were to assess the prevalence of frailty in older patients hospitalised with COVID-19, their sex and age distribution, and the completion rate of the CFS tool in evaluating frailty. Methods: Data were collected from thirteen sites. CFS was assessed routinely at the time of admission to hospital and ranged from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). The completion rate of the CFS was assessed. The presence of major comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease was noted. Results: A total of 1277 older patients with COVID-19, aged >= 65 (79.9 +/- 8.1) years were included in the study, with 98.5% having fully completed CFS. The total prevalence of frailty (CFS >= 5) was 66.9%, being higher in women than men (75.2% vs. 59.4%, p < 0.001). Frailty was found in 161 (44%) patients aged 65-74 years, 352 (69%) in 75-84 years, and 341 (85%) in >=85 years groups, and increased across the age groups (<0.0001, test for trend). Conclusion : Frailty was prevalent in our cohort of older people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. This indicates that older people who are also frail, who go on to contract COVID-19 may have disease severity significant enough to warrant hospitalization. These data may help inform health care planners and targeted interventions and appropriate management for the frail older person.	false

0	Epidemic Landscape and Forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 in India. BACKGROUND: India was one of the countries to institute strict measures for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) control in the early phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions., METHODS: We estimated the growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowdsourced time series data. Further, we also estimated the Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and Time-dependent Reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in the analysis. We modified standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models to SIR/Death (SIRD) model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the sequential Bayesian method for simulation in SIRD models., RESULTS: On average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 +/- 5.3 days. The daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95% CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95% CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of the population likely to be infected at the peak time., CONCLUSION: The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase funds for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed if air travel and social mixing resume rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccines or medicine., KEY POINTS: ., QUESTION: What are the estimates of infectious disease parameters of early phase of novel SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in India?, FINDINGS: Incidence pattern SARS-CoV-2 shows possible evidence of community transmission. However, the estimated Basic Reproductive Number (R0) is relatively lower than those observed in high burden regions (range 1.43-1.85). Our simulation using susceptible-infectious-recovered/death model shows that peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India is farther than currently projected and is likely to affect around 12.5% of population., MEANING: The lower estimated R0 is indicative of the effectiveness of early social distancing measures and lockdown. Premature relaxation of the current control measures may result in large numbers of cases in India. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press International B.V.	false

In SARS CoV-2 infection, the immune response is thought to contribute both to the pathogenesis of the disease and to protection during its resolution. While mild cases develop an immune response that contributes to host protection, immunity of severely infected patients is a balance between harmful and protective immune responses. The severity of the disease has raised many questions about the kinetic, amplitude and the quality of adaptive immunity to the virus and its generation during the early phases of infection in severe, mild and asymptomatic patients. The role of antibody and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been studied and the development of an adaptive immunity seems to correlate with convalescence. The bioinformatics study of the T and B epitopes of coronaviruses has raised the question of the existence of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this review, we discuss the adaptive immune responses and their potential roles in protection during COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 medecine/sciences - Inserm.	false

0	Consistent localization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2 over TMPRSS2 predominance in placental villi of 15 COVID-19 positive maternal-fetal dyads. INTRODUCTION: While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant global health impact, rates of maternal to infant vertical transmission remain low (<5%). Parenchymal changes of placentas from COVID-19 infected mothers have been reported by several groups, but the localization and relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and cellular entry machinery has not been fully characterized within larger placental tissue cohorts., METHODS: An extended placental tissue cohort including samples from 15 COVID-19 positive maternal-fetal dyads (with n = 5 cases with evidence of fetal transmission) in comparison with 10 contemporary COVID-19 negative controls. Using comparative immunofluorescence, we examined the localization and relative tissue abundance of SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein (CoV2 SP) along with the co-localization of two SARS-CoV2 viral entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)., RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: CoV2 SP was present within the villous placenta in COVID-19 positive pregnancies with and without evidence of fetal transmission. We further identified the predominance of ACE2 expression in comparison with TMPRSS2. Importantly, both CoV2 SP and ACE2 expression consistently localized primarily within the outer syncytiotrophoblast layer placental villi, a key physiologic interface between mother and fetus. Overall this study provides an important basis for the ongoing evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 physiology in pregnancy and highlights the importance of the placenta as a key source of primary human tissue for ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic research efforts to reduce the global burden of COVID-19.

0	Forecasting the Spreading of COVID-19 across Nine Countries from Europe, Asia, and the American Continents Using the ARIMA Models. Since mid-November 2019, when the first SARS-CoV-2-infected patient was officially reported, the new coronavirus has affected over 10 million people from which half a million died during this short period. There is an urgent need to monitor, predict, and restrict COVID-19 in a more efficient manner. This is why Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models have been developed and used to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Ukraine, Romania, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, USA, Brazil, and India, these last three countries being otherwise the most affected presently. To increase accuracy, the daily prevalence data of COVID-19 from 10 March 2020 to 10 July 2020 were collected from the official website of the Romanian Government GOV.RO, World Health Organization (WHO), and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) websites. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (1, 1, 0), ARIMA (3, 2, 2), ARIMA (3, 2, 2), ARIMA (3, 1, 1), ARIMA (1, 0, 3), ARIMA (1, 2, 0), ARIMA (1, 1, 0), ARIMA (0, 2, 1), and ARIMA (0, 2, 0) models were chosen as the best models, depending on their lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for Ukraine, Romania, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, USA, Brazil, and India (4.70244, 1.40016, 2.76751, 2.16733, 2.98154, 2.11239, 3.21569, 4.10596, 2.78051). This study demonstrates that ARIMA models are suitable for making predictions during the current crisis and offers an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions.	false
0	Point-of-Care Diagnostics of COVID-19: From Current Work to Future Perspectives. Coronaviruses have received global concern since 2003, when an outbreak caused by SARS-CoV emerged in China. Later on, in 2012, the Middle-East respiratory syndrome spread in Saudi Arabia, caused by MERS-CoV. Currently, the global crisis is caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the same lineage of SARS-CoV. In response to the urgent need of diagnostic tools, several lab-based and biosensing techniques have been proposed so far. Five main areas have been individuated and discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The cell-culture detection and the microneutralization tests are still considered highly reliable methods. The genetic screening, featuring the well-established Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), represents the gold standard for virus detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. On the other side, immunoassays were developed, either by screening/antigen recognition of IgM/IgG or by detecting the whole virus, in blood and sera. Next, proteomic mass-spectrometry (MS)-based methodologies have also been proposed for the analysis of swab samples. Finally, virus-biosensing devices were efficiently designed. Both electrochemical immunosensors and eye-based technologies have been described, showing detection times lower than 10 min after swab introduction. Alternative to swab-based techniques, lateral flow point-of-care immunoassays are already commercially available for the analysis of blood samples. Such biosensing devices hold the advantage of being portable for on-site testing in hospitals, airports, and hotspots, virtually without any sample treatment or complicated lab precautions.	false
0	Prevalence of Cardiovascular Comorbidities in Coronavirus Disease 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: Pooled Analysis of Published Data. Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading widely around the world. We conducted this meta-analysis to explore the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. Methods and Results Relevant reports updated to April 17, 2020, were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library with no restriction on language. A random-effects model was used in this meta-analysis to obtain pooled proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. A total of 22 studies (12 for COVID-19, 4 for SARS, and 6 for MERS) were included in this analysis, and the average age of patients with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS was 46.41 +/- 1.79, 39.16 +/- 2.25, and 52.51 +/- 4.64 years, respectively. Proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in coronavirus diseases were as follows: COVID-19: proportion of hypertension was 17.1% (95% CI, 13.2%-20.9%), proportion of cardiac disease was 4.5% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.5%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%); SARS: proportion of hypertension was 4.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-7.0%), proportion of cardiac disease was 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.7%) and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 3.7% (95% CI, 1.0%-6.4%); MERS: proportion of hypertension was 30.3% (95% CI, 18.3%-42.2%), proportion of cardiac disease was 20.9% (95% CI, 10.7%-31.1%), and proportion of diabetes mellitus was 45.4% (95% CI, 27.3%-63.5%). Conclusions The prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities varies among different coronavirus-associated diseases. With the development of time, proportions of cardiovascular comorbidities in COVID-19 need further attention.	false

The value of professional identity is an interesting territory to explore, relative to working in interprofessional teams and collaborative communities The collaborative opportunities provided to health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic is a rare opportunity to underscore the silent yet significant identity of radiologic technologists as professionals. Historically and prior to the pandemic, the role of radiologic technologists remains unfamiliar, if not unrecognized in the Philippine healthcare industry. The 'alliedness' of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked. The central and indispensable role played by radiologic technologists (RTs) invites meaningful discussion and debate among peers and researchers, to better describe the professional identity and role of the RT as an indispensable member of the interprofessional team. Specific recommendations are offered to improve recognition of RTs and their professional identity within the healthcare system. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc."	false
0	COVID-19 in systemic lupus erythematosus: data from a survey on 417 patients. BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease characterised by autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to infections. COVID-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE., OBJECTIVE: to acquire information on the impact of COVID-19 in SLE., METHODS: A 26-item anonymous questionnaire investigating demographics, SLE clinical features, COVID-19 diagnoses and changes in treatments and daily habits was administered to patients with SLE from three referral centres through www.surveymonkey.com over 10 days. Data from the survey were compared to those from published estimates about the general population., RESULTS: Four-hundred-seventeen patients responded to the survey. More than 60% of subjects complained of symptoms that are also associated to COVID-19. Fourteen COVID-19 diagnoses (five confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) were reported, in contrast to a 0.73% prevalence of confirmed cases in Lombardy. One hospitalisation was reported. Fever, anosmia, dry cough, a self-reported history of neuropsychiatric SLE and a recent contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were more strongly associated with COVID-19, as were symptoms and lower compliance to behavioural preventive measures in patients' contacts. No protective effect was seen in subjects on hydroxychloroquine., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 morbidity might only moderately be increased in most patients with SLE, although limited information can be inferred on more severe cases. Hydroxychloroquine apparently seems not to confer protection to infection per se, although other beneficial roles cannot be excluded. Containment policies and behavioural preventive measures could have a major role in limiting the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 in older adults: Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital in Japan. AIM: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in particular older patients, admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 were categorized into two groups, i.e., older (>=75 years) and younger adults (<=74 years). We evaluated the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory test results, treatments and outcomes of the patients., RESULTS: The majority of the older patients had comorbidities, such as dementia, cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Comorbidities were significantly more frequent in older patients than younger patients. No association was found between age and body temperature or the incidence of respiratory failure. White blood cell count was significantly lower in older patients (P = 0.018) and the decrease in lymphocytes was greater in younger patients (P = 0.009). Computed tomography (CT) of all patients showed non-segmental, peripherally dominant ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. In older patients, antiviral drugs, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on a compassionate use basis. The difference in mortality between the older and the younger patients was not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: In older patients, typical clinical symptoms and blood test changes were often absent; however, CT always contained typical findings of COVID-19, suggesting that CT may be a useful diagnostic tool. Our report illustrates that appropriate treatment, taking patient background into consideration, may improve their condition regardless of age.

0	Polymer Topology Determines the Formation of Protein Corona on Core-Shell Nanoparticles. Linear and cyclic poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOXA) adsorbates provide excellent colloidal stability to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (FexOy NPs) within protein-rich media. However, dense shells of linear PEOXA brushes cannot prevent weak but significant attractive interactions with human serum albumin. In contrast, their cyclic PEOXA counterparts quantitatively hinder protein adsorption, as demonstrated by a combination of dynamic light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry. The cyclic PEOXA brushes generate NP shells that are denser and more compact than their linear counterparts, entirely preventing the formation of a protein corona as well as aggregation, even when the lower critical solution temperature of PEOXA in a physiological buffer is reached.	false
0	Age and Location in Severity of COVID-19 Pathology: Do Lactoferrin and Pneumococcal Vaccination Explain Low Infant Mortality and Regional Differences?. Two conundrums puzzle COVID-19 investigators: 1) morbidity and mortality is rare among infants and young children and 2) rates of morbidity and mortality exhibit large variances across nations, locales, and even within cities. It is found that the higher the rate of pneumococcal vaccination in a nation (or city) the lower the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Vaccination rates with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, poliovirus, and other vaccines do not correlate with COVID-19 risks, nor do COVID-19 case or death rates correlate with number of people in the population with diabetes, obesity, or adults over 65. Infant protection may be due to maternal antibodies and antiviral proteins in milk such as lactoferrin that are known to protect against coronavirus infections. Subsequent protection might then be conferred (and correlate with) rates of Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) (universal in infants) and pneumococcal vaccination, the latter varying widely by geography among infants, at-risk adults, and the elderly.

0	gamma-Glutamyltransferase Elevations Are Frequent in Patients With COVID-19: A Clinical Epidemiologic Study. A newly identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and now poses a major threat to global public health. Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively. Initially, in the 82 patients without chronic liver disease and alcohol history; age older than 40 years (P = 0.027); male gender (P = 0.0145); elevated CRP (P = 0.0366), ALT (P < 0.0001), and ALP (P = 0.0003); and increased TGs (P = 0.0002) were found to be associated with elevated GGT levels. Elevated GGT (P = 0.0086) and CRP (P = 0.0162) levels have a longer length of hospital stay. Conclusion:  A sizable number of patients with COVID-19 infection had elevated serum GGT levels. This elevation supports involvement of the liver in persons with COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Breast Cancer Care in the Netherlands: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put a strain on regular healthcare worldwide. In the Netherlands, the national screening programs, including for breast cancer, were halted temporarily. This posed a challenge to breast cancer care, because ~40% of cases are detected through national screening. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with breast cancer in the Netherlands., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present multicenter retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of COVID-19 on patients with breast cancer who had undergone surgery from March 9 to May 17, 2020. The primary endpoints were the number of surgical procedures performed during the study period, tumor characteristics, surgery type, and route of referral. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications during the study period., RESULTS: A total of 217 consecutive patients with breast cancer requiring surgery were included. We found an overall decrease in the number of patients with breast cancer who were undergoing surgery. The most significant decline was seen in surgery for T1-T2 and N0 tumors. A decline in the number of referrals from both the national screening program and general practitioners was observed. The incidence of postoperative complications remained stable during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: The temporary halt of the national screening program for breast cancer resulted in fewer surgical procedures during the study period and a pronounced decrease in surgery of the lower tumor stages.

0	Epidemiology of the 2020 pandemic of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia: Inadequate critical care resources and impact after 7 weeks of community spread. Objectives: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic currently spreading rapidly across the United States. We provide a comprehensive look at COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Georgia, which includes vast rural communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this infectious disease., Methods: All 159 Georgia counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 in Georgia from March 3 through April 24, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and mortality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted county-level mortality rates per 100,000 population (MRs) by county-level factors., Results: Metropolitan Atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases; however, the southwestern rural parts of Georgia, surrounding the city of Albany, had the highest bi-weekly increases in incidence rate. Among counties with >10 cases, MRs were highest in the rural counties of Randolph (233.2), Terrell (182.5), Early (136.3), and Dougherty (114.2). Counties with the highest MRs (22.5-2332 per 100,000) had a higher proportion of: non-Hispanic Blacks residents, adults aged 60+, adults earning <$20,000 annually, and residents living in rural communities when compared with counties with lower MRs. These counties also had a lower proportion of the population with a college education, lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and lower number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population., Conclusions: While urban centers in Georgia account for the bulk of COVID-19 cases, high mortality rates and low critical care capacity in rural Georgia are also of critical concern.

0	A fractional-order model for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which was firstly reported in China, has affected many countries worldwide. To understand and predict the transmission dynamics of this disease, mathematical models can be very effective. It has been shown that the fractional order is related to the memory effects, which seems to be more effective for modeling the epidemic diseases. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose fractional-order susceptible individuals, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected, recovered, and deceased (SEIRD) model for the spread of COVID-19. We consider both classical and fractional-order models and estimate the parameters by using the real data of Italy, reported by the World Health Organization. The results show that the fractional-order model has less root-mean-square error than the classical one. Finally, the prediction ability of both of the integer- and fractional-order models is evaluated by using a test data set. The results show that the fractional model provides a closer forecast to the real data. Copyright © Springer Nature B.V. 2020.	false
0	"Combined anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgG, and IgM Detection as a Better Strategy to Prevent Second Infection Spreading Waves. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is challenging many health, economic, and social systems. RT-PCR assays are diagnosis gold standard; however, they can lead to false-negative results. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA investigation can play a complementary role in assessing the individuals immune status. Majority of serological tests focus on IgM and IgG although IgA are the main immunoglobulins involved in mucosal immunity. It has been reported that digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any typical respiratory symptom. Thus, a complete screening, comprising IgA, IgM, and IgG detection could be more consistent and useful in patients with atypical symptoms or in paucisymptomatic cases. Current literature describes over 200 immunoassays available worldwide, pointing out a great results variability, depending on methodology or antigens' nature. In our study we evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG trend on a control group and on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time) with a lateral-flow combined immunoassay (LFIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dissimilar antibodies time kinetics have been described in COVID-19 (decreasing IgM concentration with IgA/IgG persistence for a longer time; as well as persistent IgA, IgG, and IgM concentration); our results confirmed both of them depending on the methodology; therefore, it is difficult to compare different studies outcomes, suggesting the importance of a serological tests international standardization. Nevertheless, we propose a flowchart with combined anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM/IgA detection as a screening on general population, where serological positivity should be considered as an ""alert,"" to avoid and contain possible new outbreaks."	false

0	Exploring optical spectroscopic techniques and nanomaterials for virus detection. Viral infections pose significant health challenges globally by affecting millions of people worldwide and consequently resulting in a negative impact on both socioeconomic development and health. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clear example of how a virus can have a global impact in the society and has demonstrated the limitations of detection and diagnostic capabilities globally. Another virus which has posed serious threats to world health is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is a lentivirus of the retroviridae family responsible for causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Even though there has been a significant progress in the HIV biosensing over the past years, there is still a great need for the development of point of care (POC) biosensors that are affordable, robust, portable, easy to use and sensitive enough to provide accurate results to enable clinical decision making. The aim of this study was to present a proof of concept for detecting HIV-1 pseudoviruses by using anti-HIV1 gp41 antibodies as capturing antibodies. In our study, glass substrates were treated with a uniform layer of silane in order to immobilize HIV gp41 antibodies on their surfaces. Thereafter, the HIV pseudovirus was added to the treated substrates followed by addition of anti-HIV gp41 antibodies conjugated to selenium nanoparticle (SeNPs) and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). The conjugation of SeNPs and AuNCs to anti-HIV gp41 antibodies was characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zeta potential while the surface morphology was characterized by fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. The UV-vis and zeta potential results showed that there was successful conjugation of SeNPs and AuNCs to anti-HIV gp41 antibodies and fluorescence microscopy showed that antibodies immobilized on glass substrates were able to capture intact HIV pseudoviruses. Furthermore, AFM also confirmed the capturing HIV pseudoviruses and we were able to differentiate between substrates with and without the HIV pseudoviruses. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of biomolecules related to HIV and therefore this system has potential in HIV biosensing applications.

0	Development and effectiveness of Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system as determined by neutralizing efficiency and entry inhibition test in vitro. With the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, there is an urgent need to establish a system for determining the effectiveness and neutralizing activity of vaccine candidates in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities. Previously, researchers had developed a pseudotyped virus system for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on HIV-1 core, bearing virus spike protein. During the development of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system, a eukaryotic expression plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was constructed and then co-transfected with HIV-1 based plasmid which containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, into HEK293T cells to prepare the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus (ppSARS-2). We have successfully established the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system for neutralization and entry inhibition assays. Huh7.5 cell line was found to be the most susceptible to our pseudotyped virus model. Different levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples of COVID-19 patients using ppSARS-2. The recombinant, soluble, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein was found to inhibit the entry of ppSARS-2 in Huh7.5 cells effectively. Furthermore, the neutralization results for ppSARS-2 were consistent with those of live SARS-CoV-2 and determined using the serum samples from convalescent patients. In conclusion, we have developed an easily accessible and reliable tool for studying the neutralizing efficiency of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the entry process of the virus in a BSL-2 laboratory.

0	"The Interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 has attracted a tremendous amount of attention as a tool to manage the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although diagnostic laboratory testing is utilized ubiquitously by physicians and encountered regularly by individuals receiving medical care, several aspects of test interpretation are incompletely understood by medical communities and the general population, creating a significant challenge in minimizing the damage caused by disease spread through informed decision making and proper testing utilization. Here, general principles of test interpretation are reviewed and applied to specific examples, such as whether asymptomatic individuals should be tested, what it means to test positive (or negative), and how to interpret tests for ""immunity passports"". Unexpectedly, the answers seem to run contrary to many of the popular narratives about testing as a tool for managing COVID-19. Although testing is an important and essential part of managing diseases like COVID-19, improper utilization can potentially have unintended negative consequences.

0	"Analysis of the Influence of the Psychology Changes of Fear Induced by the COVID-19 Epidemic on the Body. In this paper, the theory of "" Fear injury kidney "" in traditional Chinese medicine is systematically reviewed, and it is found that long-term or excessive psychological changes of fear are likely to damage kidney qi and kidney essence. On this basis, the psychological studies of patients, medical staff and the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China were analyzed, and fear psychology was found to be prevalent among all kinds of people. Modern researches on ""Fear injury kidney"" have also found that long-term or excessive fear could cause changes in the neuro-endocrine-immune system, which can induce diseases or susceptibility to some diseases. Therefore, during or after the prevalence of COVID-19, different groups of people may have emotional reactions such as stress and fear, which should be paid long-term attention, and the influence of fear on the body cannot be ignored. According to the change rule of psychological state under stress reaction, we should actively respond to and take psychological crisis intervention measures in time to reduce the harm of psychological stress to the body.

0	Assessment of clinical features and renal functions in Coronavirus disease-19: A retrospective analysis of 96 patients. BACKGROUND: The most common extra pulmonary organ dysfunction in acute respiratory distress syndrome is acute kidney injury. Current data so far indicate low incidence of AKI in Covid-19 disease., OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study, we analysed the clinical features of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and investigated the effect of Covid-19 on kidney function., METHODS: Ninety-six patients diagnosed with Covid-19 were included in our study. Demographic features (Age, gender, co-morbidities), symptoms, thorax CT findings, Covid-19 PCR results and laboratory findings were recorded. The clinical features of the patients were analysed and kidney function values before Covid-19 diagnosis were compared with kidney function values after Covid-19 diagnosis., RESULTS: Most presenting symptom was fever (51%). Most accompanying co-morbidity was hypertension (56%). According to laboratory findings; ferritin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels were statistically significantly higher in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .002, P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Also lymphocyte levels were statistically significantly lower in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .042). According to KDIGO criteria 3 (3.1%) patients had AKI during the hospital stay. For all patients, there was statistically significant difference between basal, 1st, 5th and 10th day BUN and SCr levels (P = .024 and P = .018, respectively). For severe pneumonia group there was statistically significant difference between basal, 1st, 5th and 10th day SCr levels (P = .045)., CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that Covid-19 can cause renal impairment both with pneumonia and ARDS. A large-scale prospective randomised studies are needed to reach final judgement about this topic. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	"Hand Sanitizer in a Pandemic: Wrong Formulations in the Wrong Hands. BACKGROUND: Households are increasingly stockpiling and producing hand sanitizer amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which can pose an increased risk for unintentional toxicity among children. Despite guidelines for hand sanitizer production published by the World Health Organization, many turn to streaming media for instruction., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate hand sanitizer formulations and safety precautions discussed in popular do-it-yourself (DIY) YouTube videos, and to assess the frequency of calls to poison control centers for pediatric hand sanitizer exposure before and after the arrival of COVID-19 in the United States., METHODS: The first 100 videos on YouTube with the most views using the search term ""DIY hand sanitizer"" were evaluated for accuracy compared with the World Health Organization local hand sanitizer production guidelines. The incidence of pediatric hand sanitizer exposure reported to participating U.S. poison control centers from January 2018 through May 2020 was reviewed from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. The average number of calls between January 2020 and May 2020 was compared, and the average number of calls in March 2020 was compared with March 2019 and March 2018., RESULTS: Of the YouTube videos that met inclusion criteria, 27% discussed the use of at least 96% ethanol or 99.8% isopropyl alcohol, 4.1% incorporated 3% hydrogen peroxide, 82% used glycerol or an alternative humectant, and 4.1% specified the need for distilled or previously boiled water. Most of the videos failed to describe labeling storage containers, 69% of videos encouraged the use of oils or perfumes to enhance hand sanitizer scent, and 2% of videos promoted the use of coloring agents to be more attractive for use among children specifically. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls to poison control centers regarding unsafe pediatric hand sanitizer exposure since the first confirmed COVID-19 patient in the United States. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls in March 2020 compared with the previous 2 years., CONCLUSIONS: YouTube may not be an accurate source for effective hand sanitizer concoction. Health care providers and parents should be aware of the increased surge in hand sanitizer exposure among children and should take proper precautionary measures. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

0	Caregiver and service provider vaccine confidence following the Changchun Changsheng vaccine incident in China: A cross-sectional mixed methods study. INTRODUCTION: The Changchun Changsheng Vaccine Incident (CCVI) occurred mid-2018 and involved irregularities in the manufacture and quality control of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis and rabies vaccines. This study investigates vaccine confidence amongst Chinese caregivers and vaccination-service providers (VSPs) six months after the CCVI., METHODS: Quantitative surveys were conducted in January 2019 with 2124 caregivers of children and 555 VSPs in three areas in China. The proportions of respondents who agreed to the four statements from the Vaccine Confidence Index TM were used to measure vaccine confidence. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed to study the level of vaccine confidence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 caregivers, 43 VSPs and 9 immunization program managers. Interviews were analyzed thematically using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. Media surveillance was conducted to monitor public responses to the CCVI., RESULTS: Media surveillance indicated that public attention to vaccine-related issues increased sharply immediately post-CCVI but declined rapidly thereafter. Six months post-CCVI, 96.0% of caregivers and the same proportion of VSPs reported that vaccination was important and compatible with their religious beliefs. 82.7% and 88.2% of caregivers agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. 92.8% and 94.6% of VSPs agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. Both caregivers and VSPs reported an immediate decline in vaccine confidence post-CCVI. In most cases this trust was regained over time following government and public health responses, however some people remained hesitant about vaccinating their children. Many VSPs were overwhelmed by consultations, workload and psychological pressure after the CCVI., CONCLUSION: After an initial decline, vaccine confidence recovered to pre-incident levels six months after the CCVI. However, some caregivers moved from the higher to the lower end of the vaccine confidence spectrum, pointing to the need to promote the acceptance of vaccination especially given the need for new vaccines to control the coronavirus epidemic.

0	Global dynamics of a multi-strain SEIR epidemic model with general incidence rates: application to COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the global stability analysis of two-strain epidemic model with two general incidence rates. The problem is modelled by a system of six nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed individuals. The wellposedness of the suggested model is established in terms of existence, positivity and boundedness of solutions. Four equilibrium points are given, namely the disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 1, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 2, and the last endemic equilibrium with respect to both strains. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functional, the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved depending on the basic reproduction number R-0. Furthermore, using other appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global stability results of the endemic equilibria are established depending on the strain 1 reproduction number R-0(1) and the strain 2 reproduction number R-0(2). Numerical simulations are performed in order to confirm the different theoretical results. It was observed that the model with a generalized incidence functions encompasses a large number of models with classical incidence functions and it gives a significant wide view about the equilibria stability. Numerical comparison between the model results and COVID-19 clinical data was conducted. Good fit of the model to the real clinical data was remarked. The impact of the quarantine strategy on controlling the infection spread is discussed. The generalization of the problem to a more complex compartmental model is illustrated at the end of this paper.	false
0	Histopathologic evaluation of placentas after diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Background: The impact of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on placental histopathology is not well known. Objective(s): To determine if any significant placental histopathologic changes occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy and whether these changes are correlated with the presence or absence of symptoms associated with the infection. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who delivered at a single center from April 9, 2020 to April 27, 2020, and had placental specimens reviewed by the Department of Pathology. Women with singleton gestations and laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were eligible for inclusion. Historical controls selected from a cohort of women who delivered 6 months before the study period were matched in a 1:1 fashion by weeks of gestation at delivery. Histopathologic characteristics were evaluated in each placenta, and the incidence of these findings was compared between placentas of those who received a diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and historical controls, and between placentas from patients with or without typical symptoms related to the infection. Statistical analyses included the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test for the comparison of categorical and continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of <.05. Result(s): A total of 50 placentas after the diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and 50 historical controls were analyzed. Among the placentas from patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 3 (6%) were preterm (33 3/7, 34 6/7, and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation), 16 (32%) were from patients with typical symptoms related to the infection, and 34 (68%) were from patients without typical symptoms related to the infection. All patients had received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the third trimester. Decidual vasculopathy was not visualized in any of the placentas from patients diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. There was no statistically significant difference in placental histopathologic characteristics between the groups. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results for all neonates at 24 hours of life were negative. Conclusion(s): Based on the results of this study, there are no significant placental histopathologic changes that occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in women during the third trimester of pregnancy compared with a gestational age-matched historical control group. Similar incidences of histopathologic findings were also discovered when comparing placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with or without the presence of symptoms typically related to the infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	Bowel ulceration following tocilizumab administration in a COVID-19 patient. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6, has been used to treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Acute ulcerative bowel disease has been only rarely documented in patients treated for rheumatological conditions. The gastrointestinal side effects seen when used in the context of COVID-19 are unknown. We present a case of COVID-19 CRS in which acute terminal ileum and perforated caecal ulceration evolved after tocilizumab exposure. We raise awareness of a possible causal relationship between even a single dose of tocilizumab and gut ulceration in patients with COVID-19. Any such drug enteropathy relationship requires watchful monitoring during upcoming trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Supportive Management and Interventions for Respiratory Failure Due to SARS-CoV-2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can vary from asymptomatic to severe symptoms. It can lead to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Triaging patients is key to prevent spread, conserving medical resources, and providing appropriate care. The treatment of these patients remains supportive. Respiratory failure due to the virus should be managed by providing supplemental oxygen and early intubation. Some patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory hypoxemia. In this article, we review the 2 phenotypes of respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation and the management of refractory hypoxemia.	false
0	Empiric Antibacterial Therapy and Community-onset Bacterial Co-infection in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Multi-Hospital Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Antibacterials may be initiated out of concern for bacterial co-infection in patients with COVID-19. We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULT(S): Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per 10 years), had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99-1.00] per kg/m 2), had more severe illness (e.g., severe sepsis, ARR: 1.16 [1.07-1.27]), had a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04-1.42]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15-1.47]). Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time (returned <=1 day in March [54.2%, 461/850] vs. in April [85.2%, 628/737], P<.001) and empiric antibacterial use (ARR: 0.71 [0.63-0.81] April vs. March) decreased. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial co-infections was low. Despite this, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. Antibacterial use varied widely by hospital. Reducing COVID-19 test turnaround time and supporting stewardship could improve antibacterial use.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	The COVIRL002 Trial-Tocilizumab for management of severe, non-critical COVID-19 infection: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody which targets and inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6) and has demonstrated efficacy in treating diseases associated with hyper-inflammation. Data are suggestive of tocilizumab as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of standard dose versus low dose tocilizumab in adults with severe, non-critical, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection with evidence of progressive decline in respiratory function and evolving systemic inflammation on time to intubation, non-invasive ventilation and/or all-cause mortality., TRIAL DESIGN: This trial is a phase 2, open label, two-stage, multicentre, randomised trial., PARTICIPANTS: Adult subjects with severe, non-critical, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection with evidence of progressive decline in respiratory function and evolving systemic inflammation requiring admission to hospital at St. Vincent's University Hospital and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Inclusion criteria Aged 18 years or older. Confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection (as defined by positive PCR). Evidence of hyper inflammatory state as evidenced by at least three of the following: Documented temperature >38degreeC in the past 48 hours, IL6 >40 pg/ml, or in its absence D-dimer >1.5 mugFEU /ml, Elevated CRP (>100mg/L) and/or a three-fold increase since presentation, Elevated ferritin X5 ULN, Elevated LDH (above the ULN), Elevated fibrinogen (above the ULN). Pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging. Moderate to severe respiratory failure as defined by PaO2/FiO2<=300mmHg., INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention for participants in this trial is SOC plus Tocilizumab compared to SOC alone (comparator). For Stage 1, following randomisation, subjects will receive either (Arm 1) SOC alone or (Arm 2) SOC plus Tocilizumab (standard single dose - 8mg/kg, infused over 60 minutes. Once stage 1 has fully recruited, subsequent participants will be enrolled directly into Stage 2 and receive either (Arm 1) SOC plus Tocilizumab (standard single dose - 8mg/kg, infused over 60 minutes or (Arm 2) SOC plus Tocilizumab (standard single dose - 4mg/kg, infused over 60 minutes)., MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint for this study is the time to a composite primary endpoint of progression to intubation and ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or death within 28 days post randomisation., RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised (1:1) using a central register. Randomisation will be performed through an interactive, web-based electronic data capturing database. In stage 1, eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to (Arm 1) SOC alone or to (Arm 2) SOC with single dose (8mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes. In stage 2, eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive either (Arm 1) single, standard dose (8mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes or (Arm 2) reduced dose (4mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes., BLINDING: This study is open label. The study will not be blinded to investigators, subjects, or medical or nursing staff. The trial statistician will be blinded for data analysis and will be kept unaware of treatment group assignments. To facilitate this, the randomisation schedule will be drawn up by an independent statistician and objective criteria were defined for the primary outcome to minimize potential bias., NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED: In stage 1, 90 subjects will be randomised 1:1, 45 to SOC and 45 subjects to SOC plus Tocilizumab (8mg/kg, infused over 60 minutes). In stage 2, sample size calculation for the dose evaluation stage will use data generated from stage 1 using the same primary endpoint as in stage 1., TRIAL STATUS: The COVIRL002 trial (Protocol version 1.4, 13th May 2020) commenced in May 2020 at St. Vincent's University Hospital and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Recruitment is proceeding with the aim to achieve the target sample size on or before April 2021., TRIAL REGISTRATION: COVIRL002 was registered 25 June 2020 under EudraCT number: 2020-001767-86 and Protocol identification: UCDCRC/20/02., FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol for COVIRL002 is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

0	Disease Prevention Knowledge, Anxiety, and Professional Identity during COVID-19 Pandemic in Nursing Students in Zhengzhou, China. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate nursing students' understanding of the prevention of COVID-19, as well as their anxiety towards the disease and their perception of their professional identity in the wake of the pandemic, in Zhengzhou, China., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate 474 nursing students by cluster sampling using a stratified questionnaire from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the factors affecting professional identity. Binary and multiple logistic regression were used to identify the factors affecting anxiety., RESULTS: Responders with a high level of understanding of COVID-19 and frequent use of behavioral strategies for its prevention comprised 93.2% and 30.0% of the cohort, respectively. Professional identity was significantly associated with gender and anxiety (p < .050). The prevalence of anxiety among nursing students was 12.4%. Male (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26~4.52), sophomores (OR = 5.30; 95% CI = 1.61~7.45), and infrequent use of prevention measures (OR = 3.49; 95% CI = 1.16~5.19) had a significant effect on anxiety., CONCLUSION: Anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic gives an adverse effect on the professional identity of nursing in students. Nursing education institutions need to provide psychological counseling services for nursing students, in addition to improving their teaching of COVID-19 prevention strategies.

0	Burden and prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in the ageing European population - A SHARE-based analysis. Aim: International health authorities suggest that individuals aged 65 years and above and people with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity are at increased risk of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the prevalence of risk factors is unknown in many countries. Therefore, we aim to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and Methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interview for 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to app. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (app. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors and 21.2% (app. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors. The prevalences of underlying medical conditions ranged from 4.5% for cancer to 41.4% for hypertension, and the region-specific prevalence of having at least three risk factors ranged from 18.9% in Northern Europe to 24.6% in Eastern Europe. Conclusions: Information about the prevalences of risk factors might help authorities to identify the most vulnerable subpopulations with multiple risk factors of severe COVID-19 disease and thus to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection severity is linked to superior humoral immunity against the spike. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a global pandemic. The antigen specificity and kinetics of the antibody response mounted against this novel virus are not understood in detail. Here, we report that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a larger antibody response against the spike and nucleocapsid protein and epitope spreading to subdominant viral antigens, such as open reading frame 8 and non-structural proteins. Subjects with a greater antibody response mounted a larger memory B cell response against the spike, but not the nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, we revealed that antibodies against the spike are still capable of binding the D614G spike mutant and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-1 receptor binding domain. Together, this study reveals that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a greater overall antibody response to the spike and nucleocapsid protein and a larger memory B cell response against the spike.	false
0	Tracking Smell Loss to Identify Healthcare Workers with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCW) treating COVID-19 patients are at high risk for infection and may also spread infection through their contact with vulnerable patients. Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW., METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of COVID-19 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.	false
0	Management of Orthopaedic Accidental Emergencies Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Our Experience in Preparing to Live with Corona. Introduction: With increasing prevalence of coronavirus cases (including among health care providers), the current advice for orthopaedic surgeons is to favor non-operative management of most injuries and reduce face-to-face follow-up. We present our experience in managing the patients at Government-run non-COVID-19 trauma center in Delhi in an algorithmic form. Our standard operating protocols were mainly based on recommendations of Indian Orthopaedic Association and targeted to provide healthcare at a minimum risk to the treating team as well as other patients admitted to the hospital., Methodology: We describe the inflow, in-hospital management and outflow of patients at our facility during the lockdown period and in the following unlock period (from 23 March to 8 July 2020). Those patients who had absolute indications for surgery were offered surgery, while conservative treatment was more favored in those with relative indications. We also highlight the changes incorporated in OT settings as well as in rehabilitative and follow-up period., Results: Following the described protocol helped us maintain a balance between the safety of patients and our front line workers which was evident by very low COVID-19-positive rate in admitted patients (4.22%) and health care providers (16.67%) in the above-mentioned time period., Conclusions: We need to be prepared to cohabitate with this deadly Novel Coronavirus and adapt our surgical practices according to the need of the hour by minimizing surgical indications and strengthening the training in conservative principles.

Background: Best practice for prevention, diagnosis, and management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown due to limited published data in this population., Objectives: We aimed to assess current global practice and experience in management of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy to identify information to guide prospective and randomized studies., Methods: Physicians were queried about their current approach to prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID-19 using an online survey tool distributed through multiple international organizations between April 10 and 14, 2020., Results: 515 physicians responded from 41 countries. The majority of respondents (78%) recommended prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with most recommending use of low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Significant practice variation was found regarding need for dose escalation of anticoagulation outside the setting of confirmed or suspected VTE. Respondents reported the use of bedside testing when unable to perform standard diagnostic imaging for diagnosis of VTE. 291 respondents reported observing thrombotic complications in their patients with 64% noting that the complication was pulmonary embolism (PE). Of the 44% of respondents that estimated incidence of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 in their hospital, estimates ranged widely from 1 to 50%. 174 respondents noted bleeding complications (34% minor bleeding, 14% clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and 12% major bleeding)., Conclusion: Well-designed epidemiologic studies are urgently needed to understand the incidence and risk factors of VTE and bleeding complications in COVID-19 patients. Randomized clinical trials addressing use of anticoagulation are also needed. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-alpha accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific ""disease-related"" B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6+ TFH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.

0	[Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker on clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with hypertension]. Objective: To analyze the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hypertension, and to provide an evidence for selecting antihypertensive drugs in those patients. Methods: Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 58 COVID-19 patients with hypertension admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to February 22, 2020, including epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest CT and outcome. Patients were divided into ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group. Results: Twenty-six patients were in ACEI/ARB group and the other 32 patients in non-ACEI/ARB group, with median age 64.0 (49.5, 72.0) years and 64.0 (57.0, 68.8) years respectively. The median time to onset was 5(3, 8) days in ACEI/ARB group and 4 (3, 7) days in non-ACEI/ARB group, the proportion of patients with severe or critical illness was 19.2% and 15.6% respectively. The main clinical symptoms in two groups were fever (80.8% vs. 84.4%) and cough (23.1% vs. 31.3%). The following parameters were comparable including lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, bilateral involvement in chest CT (76.9% vs. 71.9%), worsening of COVID-19 (15.4% vs. 9.4%), favorable outcome (92.3% vs. 96.9%) between ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group respectively (all P>0.05). However, compared with non-ACEI/ARB group, serum creatinine [80.49 (68.72, 95.30) mumol/L vs. 71.29 (50.98, 76.98) mumol/L, P=0.007] was higher significantly in ACEI/ARB group. Conclusions: ACEI/ARB drugs have no significant effects on baseline clinical parameters (serum creatine and myoglobin excluded) , outcome, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs are not suggested to adjust in those patients, but the potential impairment of renal function as elevation of serum creatinine should be paid attention in patients administrating ACEI/ARB drugs.	false

0	ACE2 expression in adipose tissue is associated with COVID-19 cardio-metabolic risk factors and cell type composition. COVID-19 severity has varied widely, with demographic and cardio-metabolic factors increasing risk of severe reactions to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms for this remain uncertain. We investigated phenotypic and genetic factors associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ), which has been shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. In a meta-analysis of three independent studies including up to 1,471 participants, lower adipose tissue ACE2 expression was associated with adverse cardio-metabolic health indices including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity status, higher serum fasting insulin and BMI, and lower serum HDL levels (P<5.32x10 -4 ). ACE2 expression levels were also associated with estimated proportions of cell types in adipose tissue; lower ACE2 expression was associated with a lower proportion of microvascular endothelial cells (P=4.25x10 -4 ) and higher macrophage proportion (P=2.74x10 -5 ), suggesting a link to inflammation. Despite an estimated heritability of 32%, we did not identify any proximal or distal genetic variants (eQTLs) associated with adipose tissue ACE2 expression. Our results demonstrate that at-risk individuals have lower background ACE2 levels in this highly relevant tissue. Further studies will be required to establish how this may contribute to increased COVID-19 severity.	false
0	Hospital biosecurity capacitation: Analysis and recommendations for the prevention and control of COVID-19. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 highlighted several concerns regarding hospital biosafety capacitation in the People's Republic of China, although the epidemic is now under control. This study examined the primary problems related to hospital biosecurity, including the absence of a hospital emergency system, inadequate management and control of nosocomial infection, limited hospital laboratory capacity, and poor hospital admission capacity. Accordingly, this study puts forward the following countermeasures and suggestions for hospitals to deal with future biosecurity events, such as a major epidemic: first, biosecurity management systems and emergency response mechanisms in hospitals need to be set up; second, the investment and guarantee mechanisms for hospital biosecurity construction should be improved; third, the capacity building of biosecurity incident management requires special attention in general hospitals; and finally, comprehensive plans need to be developed for the integrated construction of medical treatment and prevention facilities through disease-control systems.

0	Ethical issues related to the hydroxychloroquine treatment prescription for Covid-19. The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has led to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To date, no drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Although the association between Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin efficacy lack of solid evidence-base, several governments have adopted it for all virology confirmed Covid-19 cases even for those who are asymptomatic. In the following, we aim to discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the use of this treatment association. We mainly tried to discuss the following controversial questions: Is it ethical not to treat a patient while a treatment exists and is used for other indications than Covid-19 for which it's not proven yet? If yes, is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the Covid-19 treatment, necessary, in the context of covid-19 pandemic? If no, is it the government's right to decide the hydroxychloroquine treatment for all covid-19 patients? And what should be the physicians' attitudes? Finally, what are the government, physicians, and patient's rights and responsibilities? The paper conclude that, since health authorities in some countries recommended this off-label use treatment, physicians are challenged by the requirement of veracity while providing care to their patients and the implications of such a requirement; they are facing the challenge of balancing this guideline and their own conviction. Furthermore, the fundamental principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, and respect for persons should underlie any reflection process to address this dilemma. In addition, in a pandemic context, the limits between the government's, practitioner's and patient's rights and obligations are not clear which could significantly endanger the universal ethical principles in clinical practice. It could also undermine any attempt to develop serious clinical trials to prove the considered off-label drug. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	false
0	COVID-19 co-infection in a patient with brucella bacteremia. We discuss a patient who presented with fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, sore throat, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The total white blood cell count was normal. The lymphocyte and platelet counts were within normal limits. There was no contact with confirmed COVID-19 patient, but the disease was circulating at the time of presentation. He admitted to anosmia and hypogeusia. A nasopharyngeal swab r-RT PCR test was positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. His chest examination and chest x-ray were normal. The patient had contact with animals and consumed unpasteurized camel milk. Both the blood culture and brucella serology tests were positive. This case illustrates that co-infection can occur and it is important to rule out endemic diseases in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, patients presenting with febrile endemic diseases may be harboring mild SARS-COV-2 virus infections and may need to be screened when the disease is suggested by epidemiological exposure.

0	[Prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical laboratories: implementation of contingency plan and postpandemic response strategies]. The outbreak of COVID-19 has currently been under control in China, but now the disease has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. We formulated a prevention and control plan for clinical laboratories responsible for detection of the novel coronavirus infection. We analyzed the implementation of this plan and the problems arising from its clinical practice. We found that the layout of most clinical laboratories (including gene amplification laboratories for clinical samples) was inadequate in response to a major outbreak and did not meet the requirements for biosafety protection and etiology and serology testing; and laboratory staff showed insufficiencies in their awareness regarding biosafety protection; the functions and status of the laboratory in the fever clinic need to be enhanced to increase its detection capacity; the high density of military personnel, the low level of automation of clinical laboratory equipment, and the lack of biosafety cabinets and personal protective equipment all limit the performance of diverse military operations and major overseas missions. In view of these problems, we propose the following strategies and recommendations: the clinical laboratory needs to standardize the design and staff management according to the standards of P2 laboratory; the detection capacity and staffing of fever clinic laboratory in hospitals need to be strengthened, and a separate clinical gene amplification laboratory can be optimal; for those clinical gene amplification laboratories that fail to meet these standards, reconstruction and upgrade should be made according to the requirements of biosafety protection; for the clinical laboratory in the military medical system, in addition to enforcement of biological safety protection of the staff, sufficient supply of medical materials and biological safety equipment should be ensured and biological safety cabinets should be routinely equipped if possible.	false
0	RT-qPCR assays based on saliva rather than on nasopharyngeal swabs are possible but should be interpreted with caution: results from a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The ongoing pandemic has elicited an increasing interest regarding the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in saliva specimens rather than through nasopharyngeal swabs. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection through RT-qPCR based on salivary specimens compared to conventional nasopharyngeal swabs., METHODS: We reported our meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and pre-print archive medRxiv.og for eligible studies published up to June 1st, 2020. Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis., RESULTS: The systematic review eventually retrieved 14 studies including a total of 15 estimates, the were included in quantitative synthesis. We found a pooled specificity of 97.7% (95%CI 93.8-99.2) and a pooled sensitivity of 83.4% (95%CI 73.1-90.4), with an overall agreement assessed by means of Cohen's kappa equals to 0.750, 95%CI 0.62-0.88 (i.e. moderate agreement), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, diagnostic tests based on salivary specimens are somewhat reliable, but relatively few studies have been carried out. Moreover, such studies are characterized by low numbers and low sample power. Therefore, the of salivary samples is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more conventional RT-qPCR based on nasopharyngeal swabs.	false
0	Protein Expression Knockdown in Cancer Cells Induced by a Gemini Cationic Lipid Nanovector with Histidine-Based Polar Heads. A histidine-based gemini cationic lipid, which had already demonstrated its efficiency as a plasmid DNA (pDNA) nanocarrier, has been used in this work to transfect a small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cancer cells. In combination with the helper lipid monoolein glycerol (MOG), the cationic lipid was used as an antiGFP-siRNA nanovector in a multidisciplinary study. Initially, a biophysical characterization by zeta potential (zeta) and agarose gel electrophoresis experiments was performed to determine the lipid effective charge and confirm siRNA compaction. The lipoplexes formed were arranged in Lalpha lamellar lyotropic liquid crystal phases with a cluster-type morphology, as cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies revealed. Additionally, in vitro experiments confirmed the high gene knockdown efficiency of the lipid-based nanovehicle as detected by flow cytometry (FC) and epifluorescence microscopy, even better than that of Lipofectamine2000*, the transfecting reagent commonly used as a positive control. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that the nanovector is non-toxic to cells. Finally, using nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS), apolipoprotein A-I and A-II followed by serum albumin were identified as the proteins with higher affinity for the surface of the lipoplexes. This fact could be beyond the remarkable silencing activity of the histidine-based lipid nanocarrier herein presented.	false
0	Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19. The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-gamma and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.	false
0	Return to football training and competition after lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: medical recommendations. The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic represents a great unknown regarding the physiological changes induced in elite football players. Although it will differ from country to country, the return to sport for professional football players will follow a forced lockdown never experienced and longer than the normal annual season break. Moreover, in addition to an obvious decrease in performance, the lockdown will possibly lead to an increase of the injury risk. In fact, preseason is always a period with a specific football injury epidemiology, with an increase in the incidence and prevalence of overuse injuries. Therefore, it seems appropriate to recommend that specific training and injury prevention programmes be developed, with careful load monitoring. Training sessions should include specific aerobic, resistance, speed and flexibility training programmes. The aerobic, resistance and speed training should respect some specific phases based on the progressiveness of the training load and the consequent physiological adaptation response. These different phases, based on the current evidence found in the literature, are described in their practical details. Moreover, injury prevention exercises should be incorporated, especially focusing on overuse injuries such as tendon and muscle lesions. The aim of this paper is to provide practical recommendations for the preparation of training sessions for professional footballers returning to sport after the lockdown.

0	When to rule out COVID-19: How many negative RT-PCR tests are needed?. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians have been plagued with dilemmas related to the uncertainty about diagnostic testing for the virus. It has become commonplace for a patient under investigation (PUI) to repeatedly test negative but have imaging findings that are consistent with COVID-19. This raises the question of when the treating team should entertain alternative diagnoses. We present such a case to help provide a framework for how to weigh repeatedly negative test results in clinical decision making when there is ongoing concern for COVID-19.

The incidence of this infectious disease of respiratory origin is constantly on rise. Another infectious disease widely prevalent is tuberculosis (TB). During past corona virus pandemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, coinfection with TB was seen. We present this review as the co-infection of COVID-19 with TB has not been assessed yet, imposing a greater global threat. We suggest few measures to be implemented without delay for effectively screening the suspects of co-infection and also follow up of non-suspect patients in the post-pandemic phase.	false

OBJECTIVES: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has spread rapidly in China and many other countries. The rapid increase in the number of cases has caused widespread panic among people and has become the main public health problem in the world. Severe patients often have difficult breathing and/or hypoxemia after 1 week of onset. A few critically ill patients may not only rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, but also may cause coagulopathy, as well as multiple organs failure (such as heart, liver and kidney) or even death. This article is to analyze the predictive role of clinical features in patients with COVID-19 for severe disease, so as to help doctor monitor the severity-related features, restrain the disease progress, and provide a reference for improvement of medical treatment., METHODS: The clinical data of 208 patients with COVID-19 who were isolated and treated in Changsha Public Health Treatment Center from January 17, 2020 to March 14, 2020 were collected. All patients were the mild and ordinary adult patients on admission, including 105 males and 103 females from 19 to 84 (median age 44) years old. According to the ""Program for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infected pneumonia (Trial version 7)"" issued by the General Office of National Health Committee and Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the diagnostic and typing criteria. According to progression from mild to severe disease during hospitalization, the patients were divided into a mild group (n=183) and a severe transformation group (n=25). The clinical features such as age, underlying disease, blood routine, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, oxygenation index, and so on were analyzed. Among them, laboratory tests included white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), plasma fibrinogen (Fib), activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), D-dimer, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and oxygen partial pressure in arterial blood. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fractional concentration of inspiratory oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated. The variables with statistical significance were analyzed by logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Patients in the severe transformation group had more combined underlying diseases than those in the mild group (P<0.05). From the perspective of disease distribution, patients in the severe transformation group had more combined hypertension (P<0.05). In the severe transformation group, PT was significantly longer, the levels of Fib, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP were significantly higher than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001), while LYM, ALB, and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical features with statistically significant differences. Combined with hypertension, LYM, PT, Fib, ALB, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP as independent variables, and having severe disease or not was the dependent variable. The results show that combined hypertension, decreased LYM, longer PT, and increased CK level were independent risk factors that affected the severity of COVID-19 (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The patients with mild COVID-19 who are apt to develop severe diseases may be related to combined hypertension, decreased LYM, and longer PT, and increased CK level. For the mild patients with these clinical features, early intervention may effectively prevent the progression to severe diseases."	false
0	Preventing COVID-19 Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Facilities Through Preemptive Testing of Residents and Staff Members - Fulton County, Georgia, March-May 2020. Long-term care facility (LTCF) residents are at particularly high risk for morbidity and mortality associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), given their age and high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, combined with functional impairment that often requires frequent, close contact with health care providers, who might inadvertently spread the virus to residents (1,2). During March-May 2020 in Fulton County, Georgia, >50% of COVID-19-associated deaths occurred among LTCF residents, although these persons represented <1% of the population (3,4). Mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been an effective strategy for identifying asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in LTCFs (5). This analysis sought to evaluate the timing at which mass testing took place in relation to the known presence of a COVID-19 infection and the resulting number of infections that occurred. In 15 LTCFs that performed facility-wide testing in response to an identified case, high prevalences of additional cases in residents and staff members were found at initial testing (28.0% and 7.4%, respectively), suggesting spread of infection had already occurred by the time the first case was identified. Prevalence was also high during follow-up, with a total of 42.4% of residents and 11.8% of staff members infected overall in the response facilities. In comparison, 13 LTCFs conducted testing as a preventive strategy before a case was identified. Although the majority of these LTCFs identified at least one COVID-19 case, the prevalence was significantly lower at initial testing in both residents and staff members (0.5% and 1.0%, respectively) and overall after follow-up (1.5% and 1.7%, respectively). These findings indicate that early awareness of infections might help facilities prevent potential outbreaks by prioritizing and adhering more strictly to infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations, resulting in fewer infections than would occur when relying on symptom-based screening (6,7).	false
0	"The Prevalence and Socio-Demographic Correlates of Food Insecurity in Poland. While food insecurity (FI) has been extensively studied in many countries, there have been few empirical contributions in Poland to date. The main objective of our research was to identify the socio-demographic factors affecting the risk of FI in Poland within 2014-2019. Moreover, we aimed to examine the effects of the family-oriented social program ""Family 500+"" by comparing the situation in various types of households with children a few years before and after the program was launched. The analysis was based on the set of eight-item FI indicators adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization using the Gallup World Poll nationally representative survey data. Based on our results the most vulnerable groups in the context of FI were identified. We confirmed the importance of education, gender, age, marital status, household composition, status of employment and income in preventing FI. The effectiveness of the support program in reducing FI was demonstrated as households with at least three children experienced significant improvement in the FI status during the studied years. These findings should be especially important in the context of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI. As FI can affect the quality and quantity of food choices it is associated with a poorer health status, which increases the risk of infection, including COVID-19, and worsens recovery prognosis. Planning an efficient response to the pandemic requires a comprehension of the increased risk of exposure experienced by people, especially those who are food insecure."	false
0	Kawasaki-like disease in children with COVID-19. Children with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being reported to have manifestations of hyperinflammatory states and/or Kawasaki-like disease. In this study, we investigated children with typical and atypical Kawasaki disease (KD) likely to be associated with COVID-19. We have reported four children with Kawasaki-like disease probably associated with COVID-19. The clinical features were consistent with incomplete KD in three patients. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in one and the serology was positive in one patient with negative RT-PCR. Corticosteroids, anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and acetylsalicylic acid were used in the treatment. Three patients recovered after the treatment while one patient died. The literature review revealed 36 articles describing 320 children with Kawasaki-like disease associated with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative in 120 (65.5%) of 183 patients while the serology was positive in 130 (83.8%) of 155 patients. The therapeutic options have included IVIG, acetylsalicylic acid, tocilizumab, anakinra, enoxaparin, and methylprednisolone. Pediatric COVID-19 cases may present with atypical/incomplete Kawasaki-like disease. Thus, pediatricians need to be aware of such atypical presentations resembling KD for early diagnosis of COVID-19.	false

0	Differences of inflammatory and non-inflammatory indicators in Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with different severity. Background A variety of inflammatory and non-inflammatory indicators were increased in severe and critical Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and some of them were used to evaluate the severity and predict prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of these indicators in COVID-19 with different severity. Methods Clinical data of 46 patients with severe COVID-19 and 31 patients with critical COVID-19 were collected. The general characteristics and comorbidities of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. The initial and peak concentrations of serum troponin I (cTnI), D-dimer (D-D), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), initial and peak neutrophil counts and initial and trough lymphocyte counts were compared between two groups. The correlation between the variation of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils, lymphocytes and the severity of the disease was analyzed. The efficacy of the initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, the initial neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in predicting critical COVID-19 were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The initial and peak concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial and peak neutrophil counts in critical group were higher than those in severe group, the initial and trough counts of lymphocyte were lower than those in the severe group. Except for the initial level of PCT, the other differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The increase of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and the decrease of lymphocytes were related to the severity of the disease, OR values were 28.80, 2.20, 18.47, 10.80, 52.00, 9.60 and 21.08, respectively. Except for D-D, the other differences were statistically significant. The areas under ROC curves for predicting critical COVID-19 by initial concentrations of cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, initial lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were 0.76, 0.78, 0.83, 0.95, 0.56, 0.68 and 0.62, respectively. Conclusions The severe and critical COVID-19 patients had significant differences in concentrations of serum cTnI, D-D, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. The increase of cTnI, CRP, IL-6, PCT, neutrophils and decrease of lymphocytes indicated severe condition. The initial IL-6 might be a good indicator of COVID-19 severity.

0	How a portable negative pressure incubator for COVID-19 was created with minor modifications. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all age and patient groups, including pregnant women and neonates. There is no evidence at the moment to show vertical transmission and intrauterine virus infections in fetuses when women develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy. However infections in neonates are higher than in older children, according to the largest population-based study to date, and this means that infants may also face a higher risk of severe respiratory failure (1). Dong et al's national study of 2143 paediatric cases in China from 16 January to 8 February 2020 showed that 10.6% of the severe and critical cases were under one year of age. The incidence rates for the other paediatric age groups studied were: 1-5 years (7.3%), 6-10 years (4.2%), 11-15 years (4.1%) and 16 years plus (3.0%).

0	Exploration of turn-positive RT-PCR results and factors related to treatment outcome in COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study. The cause of some patients with negative RT-PCR results experienced turn-positive after treatment remains unclear. In addition, understanding the correlation between changes in clinical data in the course of COVID-19 and treatment outcomes is of great importance in determining the prognosis of COVID-19. To perform cause analysis of RT-PCR turn-positive and the effective screening factors related to treatment outcome in COVID-19. Clinical data, including clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiography results, treatment methods and outcomes, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from January to March 2020 in Renmin Hospitals of Wuhan University. 116 COVID-19 patients (40 in recurrent group, 29 in recovered group and 47 in unrecovered group) were recruited. In the recurrent group, white blood cell, Neutrophils, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, CD3, CD4, CD8, ratio of CD4/CD8, IgG and C4 complement were of significant difference among the baseline, negative and turn-positive time points. CD19 and CT scan results were found notable difference between recurrent group and recovered group. Odds from CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, IgM, C3 complement, C4 complement and CT scan results validated associations with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The so-called recurrence in some COVID-19 patients may be due to the false-negative of nucleic acid test results from nasopharyngeal swabs. Levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, IgM, C3 complement, C4 complement and CT results were significantly correlated with the outcome of COVID-19. The cellular immunity test could be beneficial to further screen the reliability of RT-PCR test on the basis of CT images.	false
0	Treatment of severe COVID-19 with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease. No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for treating severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine whether human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion may be effective and safe for the treatment of severe COVID-19. METHOD(S): Patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly divided into 2 groups: the standard treatment group and the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC infusion group. The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including C-reactive protein, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness and the 28-day mortality rate were 0 in the hUC-MSC treatment group, while 4 patients in the control group deteriorated to critical condition and received invasive ventilation; 3 of them died, and the 28-day mortality rate was 10.34%. In the hUC-MSC treatment group, the time to clinical improvement was shorter than that in the control group. Clinical symptoms of weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation obviously improved beginning on the third day of stem cell infusion and reached a significant difference on day 7. CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly lower from day 3 of infusion, the time for the lymphocyte count to return to the normal range was significantly faster, and lung inflammation absorption was significantly shorter on CT imaging in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group. CONCLUSION(S): Intravenous transplantation of hUC-MSCs is a safe and effective method that can be considered a salvage and priority treatment option for severe COVID-19.

0	Analytical and Clinical Evaluation of the Automated Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assay on the Roche cobas e602 Analyzer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the automated Elecsys anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody (Elecsys Ab) assay on the Roche cobas e602 analyzer. With the ongoing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, widespread and routine serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 remains a pressing need. To better understand its epidemiologic spread and to support policies aimed at curtailing further infections, reliable serologic testing is crucial for providing insight into the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 on a population level. METHOD(S): The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in polymerase chain reaction-positive, confirmed COVID-19 patient samples was determined using the Elecsys Ab assay on the Roche cobas e602 analyzer. The precision and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Ab assay were characterized and its performance was compared against the EuroImmun IgA/IgG antibody (EuroImmun Ab) assay. Calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were assessed. RESULT(S): The Elecsys Ab assay demonstrated good precision, had no cross-reactivity with other viral samples, and showed 100% concordance with the EuroImmun Ab assay. Excellent clinical performance with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The Elecsys Ab assay is a precise and highly reliable automated platform for clinical detection of seropositivity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated., METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations., FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence., INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 along with strict public health measures have resulted in unintended adverse effects, including greater levels of distress, anxiety, and depression. This study examined relative presentations of these psychopathologies in different age groups in a Canadian cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODOLOGY: Participants were subscribers to the Text4Hope program, developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey link was used to gather demographic information and responses on several self-report scales, such as Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)., RESULTS: There were 8267 individuals who completed the survey, giving a response rate of 19.4%. Overall, 909 (11.0%) respondents identified as <=25 years, 2939 (35.6%) identified as (26-40) years, 3431 (41.5%) identified as (41-60) years, 762 (9.2%) identified as over 60 years, and 226 (2.7%) did not identify their age. Mean scores on the PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scales were highest among those aged <=25 and lowest amongst those aged >60 years old., CONCLUSIONS: The finding that the prevalence rates and the mean scores for stress, anxiety, and depression on standardized scales to decrease from younger to older subscribers is an interesting observation with potential implications for planning to meet mental health service needs during COVID-19.	false
0	Applying the WHO ICF Framework to the Outcome Measures Used in the Evaluation of Long-Term Clinical Outcomes in Coronavirus Outbreaks. (1) Objective: The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) classification is a unified framework for the description of health and health-related states. This study aimed to use the ICF framework to classify outcome measures used in follow-up studies of coronavirus outbreaks and make recommendations for future studies. (2) Methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO were systematically searched for original studies assessing clinical outcomes in adult survivors of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) after hospital discharge. Individual items of the identified outcome measures were linked to ICF second-level and third-level categories using ICF linking rules and categorized according to an ICF component. (3) Results: In total, 33 outcome measures were identified from 36 studies. Commonly used (a) ICF body function measures were Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT), Impact of event scale (IES-R) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); (b) ICF activity was 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD); (c) ICF participation measures included Short Form-36 (SF-36) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). ICF environmental factors and personal factors were rarely measured. (4) Conclusions: We recommend future COVID-19 follow-up studies to use the ICF framework to select a combination of outcome measures that capture all the components for a better understanding of the impact on survivors and planning interventions to maximize functional return.	false
0	A mathematical study on the spread of COVID-19 considering social distancing and rapid assessment: The case of Jakarta, Indonesia. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rapid testing and social distancing in controlling the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. We formulate a modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered compartmental model considering asymptomatic individuals. Rapid testing is intended to trace the existence of asymptomatic infected individuals among the population. This asymptomatic class is categorized into two subclasses: detected and undetected asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, the model considers the limitations of medical resources to treat an infected individual in a hospital. The model shows two types of equilibrium point: COVID-19 free and COVID-19 endemic. The COVID-19-free equilibrium point is locally and asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number ( R0 ) is less than unity. In contrast, COVID-19-endemic equilibrium always exists when R0 > 1 . The model can also show a backward bifurcation at R0 = 1 whenever the treatment saturation parameter, which describes the hospital capacity, is larger than a specific threshold. To justify the model parameters, we use the incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. The data pertain to infected individuals who self-isolate in their homes and visit the hospital for further treatment. Our numerical experiments indicate that strict social distancing has the potential to succeed in reducing and delaying the time of an outbreak. However, if the strict social distancing policy is relaxed, a massive rapid-test intervention should be conducted to avoid a large-scale outbreak in the future. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	Identification of influential users on Twitter: A novel weighted correlated influence measure for Covid-19. In the era of advanced mobile technology, freedom of expression over social media has become prevalent among online users. This generates a huge amount of communication that eventually forms a ground for extensive research and analysis. The social network analysis allows identifying the influential people in society over microblogging platforms. Twitter, being an evolving social media platform, has become increasingly vital for online dialogues, trends, and content virality. Applications of discovering influential users over Twitter are manifold. It includes viral marketing, brand analysis, news dissemination, health awareness spreading, propagating political movement, and opinion leaders for empowering governance. In our research, we have proposed a sustainable approach, namely Weighted Correlated Influence (WCI), which incorporates the relative impact of timeline-based and trend-specific features of online users. Our methodology considers merging the profile activity and underlying network topology to designate online users with an influence score, which represents the combined effect. To quantify the performance of our proposed method, the Twitter trend #CoronavirusPandemic is used. Also, the results are validated for another social media trend. The experimental outcomes depict enhanced performance of proposed WCI over existing methods that are based on precision, recall, and F1-measure for validation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

0	Analysis of a mathematical model for COVID-19 population dynamics in Lagos, Nigeria. This work examines the impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures (government and personal) on the population dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Lagos, Nigeria, using an appropriately formulated mathematical model. Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.

0	Smoking and COVID-19: Adding Fuel to the Flame. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 771,000 deaths worldwide. Tobacco smoking is a major known risk factor for severe illness and even death from many respiratory infections. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 are currently controversial. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of smoking on the clinical manifestations, disease progression, inflammatory responses, immunopathogenesis, racial ethnic disparities, and incidence of COVID-19. This review also documents future directions of smoking related research in COVID-19. The current epidemiological finding suggests that active smoking is associated with an increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Smoking can upregulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cell and activate a 'cytokine storm' which can lead to worsen outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This receptor can also act as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic sheds light on a legacy of inequalities regarding gender, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with active smoking, thus, smoking cessation may help in improving outcomes. In addition, to flatten the COVID-19 curve, staying indoors, avoiding unnecessary social contact, and bolstering the immune defense system by maintaining a healthy diet/living are highly desirable.	false
0	"Epidemiological Differences of COVID-19 Over the World. Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originally, from Wuhan, China, has now spread to most countries across the globe and devastated global healthcare systems. The impact of this disease has, however, shown baffling variations in prevalence in different regions of the world. The aim of this short review is to identify differential national COVID-19 prevalence of COVID-19, as well as to suggest these epidemiological differences. Methods A review of studies was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Search tactics were centered on COVID-19 (""COVID-19"" AND ""coronavirus"") and BCG vaccination (""BCG vaccination"" OR ""Bacillus Calmette-Guerin"" OR ""vaccine"") Results It is found that national prevalence differences may be linked with BCG childhood immunization history. A statistically insignificant difference was observed in COVID-19 prevalence when comparing countries with a BGC policy and countries without it (P> 0.05). This inconclusivity suggests the influence of confounders in this study. Conclusions National differences in COVID-19 cases can be attributable to immunologic regulations, such as BCG vaccination protocols. Caution should be taken in establishing a correlation between COVID-19 prevalence and BCG vaccination, partly due to the weak quality of statistical data on COVID-19 related to poor testing rates in countries with BCG vaccination policy. Nonetheless, the analysis of the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 will shed light on future efforts towards effective control and prevention. Copyright © 2020, Sayed et al."	false
0	Characterization of Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients at a Brooklyn Safety-Net Hospital. Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread across the country with over 3 million cases and 150,000 deaths in the United States as of July 2020. Outcomes have been poor, with reported admission rates to the intensive care team of 5% in China and mortality among critically ill patients of 50% in Seattle. Here we explore the disease characteristics in a Brooklyn safety-net hospital affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Methods A retrospective chart review of COVID-19 positive patients at The Brooklyn Hospital Center who were treated by the intensive care team prior to April 20, 2020. Data was extracted from the electronic health record, analyzed and correlated for outcome. Results Impact of various clinical treatments was assessed, showing no change in median overall survival (OS) of both hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or vitamin C with zinc. Supplemental therapies were used in selected patients, and some were shown to increase median OS and patients requiring vasopressor support or invasive mechanical ventilation showed decreased OS. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival based on ethnicity, healthcare status, or individual medical comorbidities, although a negative trend exists for diabetes. Despite this, there is a trend towards increasingly poor prognosis based on the number of comorbidities and Class 3 obesity. Conclusions Despite the fact that we show no significant differences in mortality based on ethnicity, insurance status, or individual medical comorbidities, we show a high overall mortality. There is also a trend towards increased overall mortality in Class 3 obesity, which should be further investigated. We suggest that these findings may be attributed to both socioeconomic factors and an increased incidence of total medical comorbidities in our patient population.

0	Characterization of Patients with COVID-19 Admitted to a Community Hospital of East Harlem in New York City. Background New York City was the epicenter for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to characterize the population of patients admitted with this condition to a community hospital in East Harlem located in the northeast part of the city. Methods A retrospective review of medical records of patients at least 18 years of age, admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 disease from March 14 to April 30 of 2020. Results Three hundred and seventy-one patients were identified. The majority was comprised of men. Obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were the most prevalent comorbidities. Most patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc, and vitamin C. Twenty-three percent of the patients died from the disease during the study period. Conclusion Morbidity and mortality were substantial in patients with COVID-19 admitted to a community hospital in East Harlem. Copyright © 2020, Shady et al.	false
0	Comparison of expression patterns and cell adhesion properties of the mouse biliary glycoproteins Bgp1 and Bgp2. Biliary glycoproteins are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and behave as cell adhesion molecules. The mouse genome contains two very similar Bgp genes, Bgp1 and Bgp2, whereas the human and rat genomes contain only one BGP gene. A Bgp2 isoform was previously identified as an alternative receptor for the mouse coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. This isoform consists of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail of five amino acids. In this report, we have examined whether the Bgp2 gene can express other isoforms in different mouse tissues. We found only one other isoform, which has a long cytoplasmic tail of 73 amino acids. The long cytodomain of the Bgp2 protein is highly similar to that of the Bgp1/4L isoform. The Bgp2 protein is expressed in low amounts in kidney and in a rectal carcinoma cell line. Antibodies specific to Bgp2 detected a 42-kDa protein, which is expressed at the cell surface of these samples. Bgp2 was found by immunocytochemistry in smooth muscle layers of the kidney, the uterus, in gut mononuclear cells and in the crypt epithelia of intestinal tissues. Transfection studies showed that, in contrast with Bgp1, the Bgp2 glycoprotein was not directly involved in intercellular adhesion. However, this protein is found in the proliferative compartment of the intestinal crypts and in cells involved in immune recognition. This suggests that the Bgp2 protein represents a distinctive member of the CEA family; its unusual expression patterns in mouse tissues and the unique functions it may be fulfilling may provide novel clues about the multiple functions mediated by a common BGP protein in humans and rats.	false

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting more than seventeen million people around the world. Diagnosis and treatment guidelines for clinicians caring for patients are needed. In the early stage, we have issued ""A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)""; now there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge). We also created two figures of these recommendations for the implementation purpose. We hope these recommendations can help support healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients."	false
0	Sensitivity, Specificity and Predictive Values of Molecular and Serological Tests for COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study in Emergency Room. BACKGROUND: We assessed the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of molecular and serological tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A total of 346 patients were enrolled in the emergency room. We evaluated three Reverse Transcriptase-real time PCRs (RT-PCRs) including six different gene targets, five serologic rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and one ELISA. The final classification of infected/non-infected patients was performed using Latent Class Analysis combined with clinical re-assessment of incongruous cases., RESULTS: Out of these, 24.6% of patients were classified as infected. The molecular test RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 showed the highest performance with 91.8% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100.0% PPV and 97.4% NPV respectively. Considering the single gene targets, S and RdRp of RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 had the highest sensitivity (94.1%). The in-house RdRp presented the lowest sensitivity (62.4%). The specificity ranged from 99.2% for in-house RdRp and N2 to 95.0% for E. The PPV ranged from 97.1% of N2 to 85.4% of E and the NPV from 98.1% of S to 89.0% of in-house RdRp. All serological tests had < 50% sensitivity and low PPV and NPV. VivaDiag IgM (RDT) had 98.5% specificity, with 84.0% PPV, but 24.7% sensitivity., CONCLUSION: Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection showed excellent specificity, but significant differences in sensitivity. Serological tests have limited utility in a clinical context.	false

0	Influential factors for insomnia in medical staff in the national medical aid team for Hubei Province during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the insomnia status and relevant factors for the medical staff in the medical aid team for Hubei Province during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019., METHODS: A convenient sampling survey was conducted among 1 056 medical staff in the national medical team of Hubei Province by using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy (RES)., RESULTS: The incidence from moderate to severe insomnia was 35.14%, and the total self-efficacy of emotion regulation was 3.60+/-0.91. Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of insomnia in female medical workers in Hubei Province was higher than that of male medical workers, which was increased with the elongation of work time and frequency. In addition, insomnia was associated with age, perceived ambient exposure and infection, and RES scores. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the occurrence of insomnia was mainly related to gender, perceived peripheral exposure, infection, and RES scores., CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia is very common among medical workers in Hubei Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. Insomnia is related to the medical work status, the gender and their own emotional management and regulation in the epidemic area.	false
0	"Three critical clinicobiological phases of the human SARS-associated coronavirus infections. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 immune syndrome is a multi-systemic disorder induced by the COVID-19 infection. Pathobiological transitions and clinical stages of the COVID-19 syndrome following the attack of SARS-CoV-2 on the human body have not been fully explored. The aim of this review is to outline the three critical prominent phase regarding the clinicogenomics course of the COVID-19 immune syndrome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the clinical setting, the COVID-19 process presents as ""asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic phase"", ""respiratory phase with mild/moderate/severe symptoms"" and ""multi-systemic clinical syndrome with impaired/disproportionate and/or defective immunity"". The corresponding three genomic phases include the ""ACE2, ANPEP transcripts in the initial phase"", ""EGFR and IGF2R transcripts in the propagating phase"" and the ""immune system related critical gene involvements of the complicating phase""., RESULTS: The separation of the phases is important since the genomic features of each phase are different from each other and these different mechanisms lead to distinct clinical multi-systemic features. Comprehensive genomic profiling with next generation sequencing may play an important role in defining and clarifying these three unique separate phases for COVID-19. From our point of view, it is important to understand these unique phases of the syndrome in order to approach a COVID-19 patient bedside., CONCLUSIONS: This three-phase approach may be useful for future studies which will focus on the clinical management and development of the vaccines and/or specific drugs targeting the COVID-19 processes. ANPEP gene pathway may have a potential for the vaccine development. Regarding the specific disease treatments, MAS agonists, TXA127, Angiotensin (1-7) and soluble ACE2 could have therapeutic potential for the COVID-19 course. Moreover, future CRISPR technology can be utilized for the genomic editing and future management of the clinical course of the syndrome."	false
0	"Subcutaneous Sarilumab in hospitalised patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 infection compared to the standard of care (SARCOVID): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of sarilumab, in subcutaneous administration, in hospitalised patients with moderate to early severe COVID-19 infection compared to the current standard of care, to prevent progression to systemic hyperinflammatory status. Our hypothesis is that use of subcutaneous sarilumab in early stages (window of opportunity) of COVID-19 moderate-severe pneumonia can prevent higher oxygenation requirements through non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation and decrease in-hospital stays, as well as death rate. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of sarilumab through hospitalisation and up to day 14 after discharge, compared to the control arm as assessed by incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (SAEs). In addition, as an exploratory objective, to compare the baseline clinical and biological parameters, including serum IL-6 levels, of the intervention population against controls of the same pandemic outbreak (using a propensity score) to search for markers that identify the best candidates for the treatment with subcutaneous IL-6R inhibitors and to attempt an approximation in the temporal frame of the ""window of opportunity"" TRIAL DESIGN: SARCOVID is an investigator-initiated single center randomised proof of concept study., PARTICIPANTS: Patients treated at the Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Madrid, Spain requiring hospitalisation will be consecutively recruited, meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria a.

0	"Lung transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Safely navigating the new ""normal"". In the United States, an overall national decline in organ transplants has accompanied the substantial burden of COVID-19. Amidst significant regional variations in COVID-19, lung transplantation (LTx) remains a critical life-saving operation. Our LTx practice during the early pandemic may provide a blueprint for managing LTx in an era of continued community prevalence. Patients who underwent LTx at our institution between March 1 and May 20, 2020 were included. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics were compared to those from our program in 2019, and COVID-19 testing practices were evaluated for March, April, and May to understand how our practice adapted to the pandemic. Our program performed 36 LTx, 33% more than the same period in 2019. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics during COVID-19 were similar to those in 2019. By April 1, all donors and recipients underwent pretransplant COVID-19 testing, all returning negative results. To date, no recipients have developed posttransplant COVID-19. At our institution, pretransplant COVID-19 testing, use of local donor lungs, and avoidance of donors from areas of increased community penetration supported a safe and effective LTx practice during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Continued follow-up is required to ensure the long-term safety of these newly transplanted patients.Copyright © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons"	false
0	The effects of vitamin D on acute viral respiratory infections: A rapid review. Brief overview: Current evidence suggests vitamin D replacement may reduce risk for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in people with deficiency or insufficiency, although the effects of supplementation on incidence and severity of ARTI in the general population remain unknown. Oral vitamin D supplemzentation taken at routine doses appears to be generally safe and well tolerated. Verdict: Current experimental evidence remains inconclusive regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the severity or duration of ARTI, nor on outcomes related to lung injury or hospitalization from ARTI. Based on this rapid review, sources of significant heterogeneity in published clinical trials include: differences study populations, inconsistent assessment of serum status at baseline, dosing variability, varying routes of administration, and/or inconsistent definitions of outcome measures. Experimental evidence and observations in large cohorts are generally consistent that vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L [<20 ng/mL]) and insufficiency (<75 nmol/L [<30 ng/mL]) of serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) concentration is associated with increased risk of ARTI, and supplementation for those with deficiency/insufficiency may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in the incidence of ARTI. In this rapid review, vitamin D was primarily administered as oral supplementation, and findings suggested significant differences in daily oral dosing compared to periodic bolus dosing. Based on the available experimental evidence, vitamin D supplementation appears to have a high margin of safety with very few adverse events reported in children or adults from a variety of dosing strategies. Future clinical trials on vitamin D should consider the sources of heterogeneity in the existing experimental research and design trials that account for baseline status, evaluate the potential for prevention and treatment in at risk populations, standardize dosing strategies, assess product quality, assess outcomes according to gold standard definitions/diagnostic methods, and delineate viral ARTI from other causes when possible. The available mechanistic evidence related to immunological requirements for adequate vitamin D, the availability of observational and experimental evidence suggestive of clinically meaningful benefits (especially in deficient/insufficient participants), and the high margin of safety, should make vitamin D a high priority for additional clinical research during the current COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020	false

0	The Impact of Physical Distancing and Associated Factors Towards Internet Addiction Among Adults in Indonesia During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Nationwide Web-Based Study. Introduction: Physical distancing has encouraged the public to utilize the Internet for virtually all daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Internet addiction (IA) prevalence and analyzed the correlated factors during quarantine and pandemic. Method(s): An online survey was generated, comprising of a sociodemographic section, Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), Symptoms Checklist-90, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The hyperlink was disseminated through social media, companies, and universities. Overall, 4,734 adults, (mean age 31.84 +/- 7.73 years old and 55.2% males) representing all 34 provinces of Indonesia, gave valid responses. Result(s): Point prevalence of IA during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.4% in Indonesian adults. Online duration increased by 52% compared to before the pandemic. Physical distancing was not established as a risk of IA. Increased daily online duration, specific motivations, types of application, and having confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household were predictive of IA. All subscales of SCL-90 and PSQI were higher in the group with positive/suspect cases of COVID-19 within households and were correlated to higher scores of IA. Discussion(s): Physical distancing alone was not associated with an increased risk of IA. The prevalence of IA during COVID-19 was higher than the previously proposed rate among Indonesian adults, which might be related to digital activities associated with COVID-19 and the popularity of virtual socializing. Furthermore, psychopathologies and sleep disruptions were related to IA occurrences and especially prevalent in groups with proximity to COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 contraction and rampant misinformation of COVID-19 probably contributed to these factors, which potentially harbor long-term consequences. Conclusion(s): The current study demonstrated a high point prevalence of IA and identified several preventable factors predictive of IA during home-quarantine and COVID-19, especially in adults with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household. However, physical distancing did not increase the odds of IA. Public health agencies should maintain physical distancing advisory while providing adaptive psychiatric education and service.© Copyright © 2020 Siste, Hanafi, Sen, Christian, Adrian, Siswidiani, Limawan, Murtani and Suwartono.	false
0	Incidence of Nosocomial COVID-19 in Patients Hospitalized at a Large US Academic Medical Center. Importance: Some patients are avoiding essential care for fear of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitals. There are few data, however, on the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in US hospitals. Objective(s): To assess the incidence of COVID-19 among patients hospitalized at a large US academic medical center in the 12 weeks after the first inpatient case was identified. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included all patients admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) between March 7 and May 30, 2020. Follow-up occurred through June 17, 2020. Medical records for all patients who first tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on hospital day 3 or later or within 14 days of discharge were reviewed. Exposures: A comprehensive infection control program was implemented that included dedicated COVID-19 units with airborne infection isolation rooms, personal protective equipment in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, personal protective equipment donning and doffing monitors, universal masking, restriction of visitors, and liberal RT-PCR testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Whether infection was community or hospital acquired based on timing of tests, clinical course, and exposures. Result(s): Over the 12-week period, 9149 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [26.4] years; median [IQR] age, 51 years [30-67 years]; 5243 female [57.3%]) were admitted to the hospital, for whom 7394 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed; 697 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, translating into 8656 days of COVID-19-related care. Twelve of the 697 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (1.7%) first tested positive on hospital day 3 or later (median, 4 days; range, 3-15 days). Of these, only 1 case was deemed to be hospital acquired, most likely from a presymptomatic spouse who was visiting daily and diagnosed with COVID-19 before visitor restrictions and masking were implemented. Among 8370 patients with non-COVID-19-related hospitalizations discharged through June 17, 11 (0.1%) tested positive within 14 days (median time to diagnosis, 6 days; range, 1-14 days). Only 1 case was deemed likely to be hospital acquired, albeit with no known exposures. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients in a large academic medical center with rigorous infection control measures, nosocomial COVID-19 was rare during the height of the pandemic in the region. These findings may inform practices in other institutions and provide reassurance to patients concerned about contracting COVID-19 in hospitals.Copyright © 2020 American Medical Association.

0	Symptomatic pericardial effusion in the setting of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection: A case report. RATIONALE: Infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to cause multi-organ involvement including cardiopulmonary serosal layers infection and inflammation. As a result, pericarditis and pericardial effusion may occur with or without COVID-19 related respiratory signs. Due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity of current COVID-19 diagnostic studies, cases that trigger high clinical intuition, even with negative serologic and polymerase chain reaction testing results, may necessitate further diagnostic workup to discover the underlying etiology. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we present a rare case of pericardial effusion in the setting of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection manifesting with the chief complaint of chest pain. DIAGNOSIS: While undergoing diagnostic workup, the patients first 2 sets of COVID 19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were negative while a latter RT-PCR test, as well as serology, were positive, leading to the diagnosis of COVID-19 reinfection or subacute presentation of viral infection with pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram depicted large circumferential pericardial effusion with mildly thickened pericardium. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent pericardial window placement followed by ibuprofen administration and discharged from the hospital. OUTCOME(S): During the follow-up visit patient had no symptoms and echocardiogram demonstrated complete resolution of the effusion. LESSONS: Due to the possible establishment of pericardial effusions and consecutively tamponade even without any COVID-19 related clinical presentation, it is crucial for clinicians to trust their intuition, conduct the appropriate diagnostic tests, find the underlying diagnosis and prevent the devastating consequences.	false

0	Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein glycan shield reveals implications for immune recognition. Here we have generated 3D structures of glycoforms of the spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2, based on reported 3D structures and glycomics data for the protein produced in HEK293 cells. We also analyze structures for glycoforms representing those present in the nascent glycoproteins (prior to enzymatic modifications in the Golgi), as well as those that are commonly observed on antigens present in other viruses. These models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the extent to which glycan microheterogeneity impacts the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein. Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the innate and adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine. The 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the notable exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight of the S trimer (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) they shield approximately 40% of the protein surface.	false

0	Humanized single domain antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting the spike receptor binding domain. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads worldwide and leads to an unprecedented medical burden and lives lost. Neutralizing antibodies provide efficient blockade for viral infection and are a promising category of biological therapies. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as a bait, we generate a panel of humanized single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from a synthetic library. These sdAbs reveal binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.99-35.5nM. The monomeric sdAbs show half maximal neutralization concentration (EC50) of 0.0009-0.07micro g/mL and 0.13-0.51micro g/mL against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes, and authentic SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Competitive ligand-binding experiments suggest that the sdAbs either completely block or significantly inhibit the association between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and viral entry receptor ACE2. Fusion of the human IgG1 Fc to sdAbs improve their neutralization activity by up to ten times. These results support neutralizing sdAbs as a potential alternative for antiviral therapies.	false
0	Optimal Control Design of Impulsive SQEIAR Epidemic Models with Application to COVID-19. This paper presents a SEIAR-type model considering quarantined individuals (Q), called SQEIAR model. The dynamic of SQEIAR model is defined by six ordinary differential equations that describe the numbers of Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered individuals. The goal of this paper is to reduce the size of susceptible, infected, exposed and asymptomatic groups to consequently eradicate the infection by using two actions: the quarantine and the treatment of infected people. To reach this purpose, optimal control theory is presented to control the epidemic model over free terminal optimal time control with an optimal cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimal final time. Also, an impulsive epidemic model of SQEIAR is considered to deal with the potential suddenly increased in population caused by immigration or travel. Since this model is suitable to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, especial attention is devoted to this case. Thus, numerical simulations are given to prove the accuracy of the theoretical claims and applied to the particular data of this infection. Moreover, numerical computations of the COVID-19 are compared with diseases like Ebola and Influenza. In addition, the controller is evaluated with system parameters identified by using actual data of China. Finally, the controller tuned with the estimated parameters of the Chinese data is applied to the actual data of Spain to compare the quarantine and treatment policies in both countries.

0	Immunoinformatics characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for prioritization of epitope based multivalent peptide vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern and thus calling for the development of effective and safe therapeutics and prophylactics particularly a vaccine to protect against the infection. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for a vaccine, antibodies, and inhibitors development because of the many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In the present investigation, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immunoinformatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous milieu aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel axial frequency distribution (AFD) analytical tool. Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus could be considered in experimental studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

0	The Potential Role of Immune Alteration in the Cancer-COVID19 Equation-A Prospective Longitudinal Study. Background: The risk of cancer patients to develop COVID19 infection is unclear. We aimed to prospectively study cancer patients and oncology healthcare workers for COVID19 serology. In IgG+ cases, immune profile was determined to portray the pattern of immune response to SARS-CoV2. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment and healthcare workers were enrolled. During the study period (3/2020-6/2020), demographic data and blood were collected at three time points. Expression of IgG, IgM, and IgA were assessed. In SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cases and matched negative cases, we performed mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis on the basis of the expression of surface markers. Results: The study included 164 cancer patients on active intravenous treatment and 107 healthcare workers at the cancer center. No symptomatic cases were reported during the study period. Serology analysis revealed four IgG+ patients (2.4%) and two IgG+ healthcare workers (1.9%)-all were asymptomatic. CyTOF analysis demonstrated substantial reduction in myeloid cells in healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ compared to those who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG-, whereas in cancer patients, the reduction was relatively milder (=50% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cancer patients compared with =90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ workers). Conclusion:  Our results indicate a similar rate of asymptomatic COVID19 infection in cancer patients and healthcare workers in a longitudinal study throughout the pandemic time. Due to differential immune cell profiles of cancer patients who are treated with immunomodulatory agents, the host response to the SARS-COV2 may play a role in COVID19 course and representation. The immunological perspective of cancer treatments on the risk for COVID19 infection should be further explored.	false
0	A Bayesian approach for monitoring epidemics in presence of undetected cases. One of the key indicators used in tracking the evolution of an infectious disease is the reproduction number. This quantity is usually computed using the reported number of cases, but ignoring that many more individuals may be infected (e.g. asymptomatic carriers). We develop a Bayesian procedure to quantify the impact of undetected infectious cases on the determination of the effective reproduction number. Our approach is stochastic, data-driven and not relying on any compartmental model. It is applied to the COVID-19 outbreak in eight different countries and all Italian regions, showing that the effect of undetected cases leads to estimates of the effective reproduction numbers larger than those obtained only with the reported cases by factors ranging from two to ten.

0	Early estimation of the risk factors for hospitalization and mortality by COVID-19 in Mexico. BACKGROUND: Due to a high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that COVID 19 poses a high risk of fatal complications for the Mexican population. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SSA). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between hospitalization and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47+/-15.62, were analyzed. Men were about 1.54 times more likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and >=74 were more likely to be hospitalized than people aged 25-49 (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 3.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized than people without these comorbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR = 1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and >=75 were more likely to die than people aged 25-49 (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination conveyed a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR = 2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalization, intubation and pneumonia entail a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR = 2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). Our study's main limitation is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population has two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, a high mortality rate is a serious risk for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Similarities in Cutaneous Histopathological Patterns between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19 High-risk Patients with Skin Dermatosis. Only recently histopathological studies of patients with dermatosis and concomitant SARS-Cov-2 viral infection were published. Seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic, more skin biopsies of COVID-19 positive patients are taking place. We examined the histological features of 30 skin biopsies from two groups of patients: Ten specimens of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with an active systemic infection and associated dermatosis. Twenty specimens were from patients not considered COVID-positive (due to PCR swab negativity or not tested at all) with cutaneous lesions either showing viral infection symptoms (fever, cough, ageusia and severe immunocompromised condition due to HIV infection and malignancies), or presented a high risk of being infected (such as cohabitation with COVID-19 positive parents and siblings with simultaneous chilblains). This study analyses the histological and immunohistochemical (SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV nucleocapsid antibody) characteristics of the two groups and identifies 4 histopathological patterns. The histopathological features of the two groups present similar features that may help to identify an ongoing COVID-19 infection even in asymptomatic carriers with dermatosis.	false
0	[Investigation on two family clusters of COVID-19 in a county of Baotou city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]. Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and transmission chain of COVID-19 in two families, and to provide scientific evidence for effective prevention and control measures. Methods: Field epidemiological investigation was conducted for the COVID-19 cases occurred in two families and the close contacts in a county of Baotou city in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Descriptive statistical analysis on epidemiological data was conducted. Results: The infection source of the COVID-19 cases in the two families was a man who had living history in Wuhan. After his return, his parents were infected by him. A few days later, the members of a neighbor family were found to be infected, and relatives of this family were also infected after dining together repeatedly. Finally, ten confirmed cases and three suspected cases of COVID-19 were detected in the two families. Conclusions: Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur not only in a family but also in neighborhoods. The cases in two families had close relationship, indicating the necessity to strengthen the health education about COVID-19 prevention and control and the management of groups at high risk to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in families and neighborhoods.	false
0	Human development, social vulnerability and COVID-19 in Brazil: a study of the social determinants of health. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in Brazil in February 2020. Since then, the disease has spread throughout the country, reaching the poorest areas. This study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 and the population's living conditions. We aimed to identify social determinants related to the incidence, mortality, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Brazil, in 2020., METHODS: This is an ecological study evaluating the relationship between COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates and 49 social indicators of human development and social vulnerability. For the analysis, bivariate spatial correlation and multivariate and spatial regression models (spatial lag model and spatial error models) were used, considering a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 5%., RESULTS: A total of 44.8% of municipalities registered confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 14.7% had deaths. We observed that 56.2% of municipalities with confirmed cases had very low human development (COVID-19 incidence rate: 59.00/100 000; mortality rate: 36.75/1 000 000), and 52.8% had very high vulnerability (COVID-19 incidence rate: 41.68/100 000; mortality rate: 27.46/1 000 000). The regression model showed 17 indicators associated with transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil., CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 first arrived in the most developed and least vulnerable municipalities in Brazil, it has already reached locations that are farther from large urban centers, whose populations are exposed to a context of intense social vulnerability. Based on these findings, it is necessary to adopt measures that take local social aspects into account in order to contain the pandemic.	false
0	Implications of myocardial injury in Mexican hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background: Respiratory illnesses is the most common manifestation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, myocardial injury has recently emerged as a frequent complication. Method(s): An observational, longitudinal, prospective, and multicenter study of hospitalized Mexican patients was made. We assessed the prevalence of myocardial injury and its relationship with complications and mortality. Result(s): 254 COVID-19 patients were included. Their average age was 53.8 years old, 167 (65.7%) were male and 87 (34.3%) female. According to troponin levels, two populations were generated, those with and without myocardial injury. There was no difference in gender or age between both groups. However, there was a greater proportion of obesity and hypertension in myocardial injury group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that obesity (OR 2.029, 95% CI 1.039-3.961; p = 0.038), arterial oxygen saturation <90% (OR 2.250, 95% CI 1.216-3.560; p = 0.025), and systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg (OR 2.636, 95% CI 1.530-4.343; p = 0.042), were directly related to higher levels of troponins. Multivariate cox proportional hazards analysis showed that primary endpoint (mortality) was determined by overweight/obesity (OR 1.290, 95% CI 0.115-0.730; p = 0.009), ferritin levels (OR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.001; p < 0.001), myocardial injury (OR 3.764, 95% CI 1.307-10.838; p = 0.014), septic shock (OR 4.104, 95% CI 1.142-14.132; p = 0.024), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 3.001, 95% CI 1.008-10.165; p = 0.040), and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (OR 0.357, 95% IC 0.133-0.955; p = 0.040). Secondary endpoint (Mechanical ventilation risk) was associated to the same factors. Conclusion(s): Myocardial injury represents an increased risk of complications and death in Mexican hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Parameters predicting COVID-19-induced myocardial injury and mortality. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 affect many organs, including the heart. Cardiovascular disease is a dominant comorbidity and prognostic factors predicting risk for critical courses are highly needed. Moreover, immunomechanisms underlying COVID-induced myocardial damage are poorly understood. Objective(s): To elucidate prognostic markers to identify patients at risk. Result(s): Only patients with pericardial effusion (PE) developed a severe disease course, and those who died could be identified by a high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio. Ten out of 19 COVID-19 patients presented with PE, 7 (78%) of these had elevated APACHE-II mortality risk-score, requiring mechanical ventilation. At admission, PE patients showed signs of systemic and cardiac inflammation in NMR and impaired cardiac function as detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), whereas parameters of myocardial injury e.g. high sensitive troponin-t (hs-TnT) were not yet increased. During the course of disease, hs-TnT rose in 8 of the PE-patients above 16 ng/l, 7 had to undergo ventilatory therapy and 4 of them died. FACS at admission showed in PE patients elevated frequencies of CD3+CD8+ T cells among all CD3+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of Tregs and CD14+HLA-DR+-monocytes. A high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in PE patients, and was associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines. By contrast, patients without PE and PE patients with a low CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio neither had to be intubated, nor died. Conclusion(s): PE predicts cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TTE should be performed at admission. Immunological parameters for dysfunctional antiviral immunity, such as the CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio used here, supports risk assessment by predicting poor prognosis.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical characteristics and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients under investigation in Thailand. To manage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a national health authority has implemented a case definition of patients under investigation (PUIs) to guide clinicians' diagnoses. We aimed to determine characteristics among all PUIs and those with and without COVID-19. We retrospectively reviewed clinical characteristics and risk factors for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among PUIs at a tertiary care center in Bangkok, Thailand, between March 23 and April 7, 2020. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed. There were 405 evaluable PUIs; 157 (38.8%) were men, with a mean age +/- SD of 36.2 +/- 12.6 years. The majority (68.9%) reported no comorbidities. There were 53 (13.1%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. The most common symptoms among those were cough (73.6%), fever (58.5%), sore throat (39.6%), and muscle pain (37.4%). Among these patients, diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (69.8%), viral syndrome (15.1%), pneumonia (11.3%), and asymptomatic infection (3.8%). Multivariate analysis identified close contact with an index case (OR, 3.49; 95%CI, 1.49-8.15; P = 0.004), visiting high-risk places (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.03-3.56; P = 0.039), productive cough (OR, 2.03; 95%CI, 1.05-3.92; P = 0.034), and no medical coverage (OR, 3.91; 95%CI, 1.35-11.32; P = 0.012) as independent risk factors for COVID-19 among the PUIs. The majority had favorable outcomes, though one (1.9%) died from severe pneumonia. COVID-19 was identified in 13% of PUIs defined per a national health authority's case definition. History of contact with a COVID-19 patient, visiting a high-risk place, having no medical coverage, and productive cough may identify individuals at risk of COVID-19 in Thailand.	false
0	Clinical and immunologic features among COVID-19-affected mother-infant pairs: antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detected in breast milk. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains threatening to women and children, but clinical evidence regarding women during pregnancy, puerperium and lactation is limited. We assessed clinical and immunologic features of and breastfeeding advice provided to mother-infant pairs. This observational analysis was conducted in a tertiary-care centre in Wuhan, China. Pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who delivered during hospitalization were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and serial specimens of the mother-infant pairs were examined, supplemented with follow-ups regarding recovery and breastfeeding. Fourteen pregnant patients had live births and recovered well; four patients continued breastfeeding while taking precautions. No neonatal infections were observed. No infants developed COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Common maternal symptoms were fever (11/14, 78.1%) and cough (6/14, 42.9%). A pregnancy-specific symptom was abnormal foetal movement, which was noticed by three patients (21.4%). The mean virus shedding time was 9 days (standard deviation, 6 days; range, 1-22 days). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome was not detected in breast milk or maternal vaginal secretions. Immunologic assay revealed seroconversion of IgM on day 8 after onset and IgG on day 28. Both IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in breast milk, cord blood and neonatal serum. The study results suggest that passive acquisition of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is available by ingesting breast milk.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, have posed severe threats to global public health and the economy. Treatment and prevention of these viral diseases call for the research and development of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs). Scientists have screened neutralizing antibodies using the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an antigen, indicating that RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses. This review summarizes the structure and function of RBD and RBD-specific NMAbs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 currently under development.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Hypokalemia as a sensitive biomarker of disease severity and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement in COVID-19 pneumonia: a case series of 306 Mediterranean patients. OBJECTIVES: Serum levels of potassium (K+) seem significantly lower in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an unknown clinical translation. The objective was to investigate whether hypokalemia acts as a biomarker of severity in COVID-19 pneumonia, and associates with major clinical outcomes. METHOD(S): Retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia (March 3 - May 2, 2020). Patients were categorized according to nadir levels of K+in the first 72hours of admission: hypokalemia (K+ <=3.5mmol/L) and normokalemia (>3.5mmol/L). Main outcomes were all-cause mortality and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI). RESULT(S): 306 patients were enrolled. Ninety-four patients (30.7%) had hypokalemia, showing at baseline significantly higher comorbidity (Charlson index >=3, 30.0% vs. 16.3%)(p=0.02), CURB65 scores (1.5(0.0-3.0) vs. 1.0(0.0-2.0))(p=0.04), and some inflammatory parameters. After adjustment for confounders, hypokalemia was independently associated with requiring IMV during the admission (OR 8.98; 95%CI 2.54-31.74). Mortality was 15.0% (n=46) and was not influenced by low K+. Hypokalemia was associated with longer hospital and ICU stay. CONCLUSION(S): Hypokalemia is prevalent in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Hypokalemia is an independent predictor of IMV requirement and seems to be a sensitive biomarker of severe progression of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Negative results in nucleic acid test of COVID-19 patients: assessment from the perspective of clinical laboratories. Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is prevalent around the world, and the number of infected cases has increased rapidly. Viral nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 can provide direct evidence for rapid diagnosis, disease course monitoring, and therapeutic efficacy. However, in practice, false-negative results in nucleic acid test are common, causing missed diagnoses, which are not conducive to the prevention and control of this outbreak. This article analyzes the possible causes and proposed measures to reduce the false-negative rate of nucleic acid test results and more effectively curb the outbreak.	false
0	Compassionate use of convalescent plasma for treatment of moderate and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and association with IgG antibody levels in donated plasma. Background: We assessed outcome of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 following treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) and the association with IgG levels in transfused CP. Method(s): A prospective cohort study. Primary outcome was improvement at day 14 defined as alive, not on mechanical ventilation, and moderate, mild, or recovered from COVID-19. Antibody levels in CP units were unknown at the time of treatment. IgG against the spike protein S1 was subsequently measured by ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies titers were determined in a subset. Outcome was assessed in relation to the mean antibody level transfused to the patients (<=4.0 versus >4.0). Finding(s): Of 49 patients, 11 (22.4%) had moderate, 38 (77.6%) had severe disease, 28 were ventilated. At day 14, 24 (49.0%) patients improved, 9 (18.4%) died, and 13 (26.5%) were ventilated. In 14/98 (14.3%) CP units IgG was < 1.1 (cutoff calibration) and in 60 (61.2%) <=4.0. IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer were correlated (0.85 p < 0.001). In patients receiving <=4.0 antibody levels, 11/30 improved (36.7%) versus 13/19 (68.4%) in patients receiving >4.0 odds ratio (OR) 0.267 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.079-0.905], P = 0.030. In patients diagnosed >10 days prior to treatment, 4/14 (22.4%) improved in the <=4.0 antibody group, versus 6/7 (85.7%) in the >4.0 antibody group, OR 0.048 (95% CI, 0.004-0.520), P = 0.007. No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation(s): Treatment with CP with higher levels of IgG against S1 may benefit patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. IgG against S1 level in CP predicts neutralization antibodies titers.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Survey of the current status of subclinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: We investigated relationships between subclinical COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and background factors. Method(s): We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) prevalence in 1603 patients, doctors, and nurses in 65 medical institutions in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan and investigated their background factors. Antibodies (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by Immunochromatographic test. Result(s): The 39 subjects (2.4%) were found to be IgG antibody-positive: 29 in the patient group (2.9%), 10 in the doctor/nurse group (2.0%), and 0 in the control group. After adjustment for age, sex, and the antibody prevalence in the control group, antibody prevalence was 2.7% in the patient group and 2.1% in the doctor/nurse group. There was no significant difference between the antibody-positive subjects and the antibody-negative subjects in any background factors investigated including overseas travel, contact with overseas travelers, presence/absence of infected individuals in the living area, use of trains 5 times a week or more, BCG vaccination, and use of ACE inhibitor and ARB. Conclusion(s): Antibody prevalence in the present survey at medical institution is higher than that in Tokyo and in Osaka measured by the government suggesting that subclinical infections are occurring more frequently than expected. No background factor that influenced antibody-positive status due to subclinical infection was identified.Copyright © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases	false

0	Management of the thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19: Guidance for the hemostasis laboratory. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with extreme inflammatory response, disordered hemostasis and high thrombotic risk. A high incidence of thromboembolic events has been reported despite thromboprophylaxis, raising the question of a more effective anticoagulation. First-line hemostasis tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimers are proposed for assessing thrombotic risk and monitoring hemostasis, but are vulnerable to many drawbacks affecting their reliability and clinical relevance. Specialized hemostasis-related tests (soluble fibrin complexes, tests assessing fibrinolytic capacity, viscoelastic tests, thrombin generation) may have an interest to assess the thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19. Another challenge for the hemostasis laboratory is the monitoring of heparin treatment, especially unfractionated heparin in the setting of an extreme inflammatory response. This review aimed at evaluating the role of hemostasis tests in the management of COVID-19 and discussing their main limitations.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Prevalence of phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a prospective observational study. Background: In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to COVID-19, two phenotypes, based on the severity of systemic inflammation (hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory), have been described. The hyperinflammatory phenotype is known to be associated with increased multiorgan failure and mortality. In this study, we aimed to identify these phenotypes in COVID-19-related ARDS. Method(s): In this prospective observational study done at two UK intensive care units, we recruited patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline. Plasma samples were analysed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1) using a novel point-of-care assay. A parsimonious regression classifier model was used to calculate the probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype in COVID-19 using IL-6, soluble TNFR1, and bicarbonate levels. Data from this cohort was compared with patients with ARDS due to causes other than COVID-19 recruited to a previous UK multicentre, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin (HARP-2). Finding(s): Between March 17 and April 25, 2020, 39 patients were recruited to the study. Median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) was 18 kpa (IQR 15-21) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 12 (10-16). 17 (44%) of 39 patients had died by day 28 of the study. Compared with survivors, patients who died were older and had lower PaO2/FiO2. The median probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype was 0.03 (IQR 0.01-0.2). Depending on the probability cutoff used to assign class, the prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype was between four (10%) and eight (21%) of 39, which is lower than the proportion of patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype in HARP-2 (186 [35%] of 539). Using the Youden index cutoff (0.274) to classify phenotype, five (63%) of eight patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype and 12 (39%) of 31 with the hypoinflammatory phenotype died. Compared with matched patients recruited to HARP-2, levels of IL-6 were similar in our cohort, whereas soluble TNFR1 was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Interpretation(s): In this exploratory analysis of 39 patients, ARDS due to COVID-19 was not associated with higher systemic inflammation and was associated with a lower prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype than that observed in historical ARDS data. This finding suggests that the excess mortality observed in COVID-19-related ARDS is unlikely to be due to the upregulation of inflammatory pathways described by the parsimonious model.

0	Anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A scoping review of randomized controlled trials and call for international collaboration. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a high incidence of thrombosis and mortality despite standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. There is equipoise regarding the optimal dose of anticoagulant intervention in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and consequently, immediate answers from high-quality randomized trials are needed. METHOD(S): The World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was searched on June 17, 2020 for randomized controlled trials comparing increased dose to standard dose anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two authors independently screened the full records for eligibility and extracted data in duplicate. RESULT(S): A total of 20 trials were included in the review. All trials are open-label, 5 trials use an adaptive design, 1 trial uses a factorial design, 2 trials combine multi-arm parallel group and factorial designs in flexible platform trials, and at least 15 trials have multiple study sites. With individual target sample sizes ranging from 30 to 3,000 participants, the pooled sample size of all included trials is 12,568 participants. Two trials include only ICU patients, and 10 trials base patient eligibility on elevated D-dimer levels. Therapeutic intensity anticoagulation is evaluated in 14 trials. All-cause mortality is part of the primary outcome in 14 trials. DISCUSSION: Several trials evaluate different dose regimens of anticoagulant interventions in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Since these trials compete for sites and study participants, a collaborative effort is needed to complete trials faster, conduct pooled analyses and bring effective interventions to patients more quickly.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms: A systematic review of in vitro and in vivo studies. Due to the rapidly spreading of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop efficient vaccines and specific antiviral treatments. Pathways of the viral entry into cells are interesting subjects for targeted therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study aims to provide a systematic evaluation of the most recent in vitro and in vivo investigations targeting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. A systematic search was carried out in major medical sources, including MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Combinations of the following search terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, in vivo, preclinical, targeted therapy, and cell entry. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation assessment tools were applied for evaluating the risk of bias of in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. A narrative synthesis was performed as a qualitative method for the data synthesis of each outcome measure. A total of 2,649 articles were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Biorxiv. Finally, 22 studies (one in vivo study and 21 in vitro studies) were included. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 was the main target of investigation in 19 studies. SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the host cells through endocytosis or independently. SARS-CoV-2 S protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or CD147 as its cell-surface receptor to attach host cells. It consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit mediates viral attachment to the host cells, while the S2 subunit facilitates virus-host membrane fusion. The cleavage of the S1-S2 protein, which is required for the conformational changes of the S2 subunit and processing of viral fusion, is regulated by the host proteases, including cathepsin L (during endocytosis) and type II membrane serine protease (independently). Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non-endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry. Inhibition of the viral entry by targeting host or virus-related components remains the most potent strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. Further high-quality investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of the proposed targets and develop specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Repurposing Drugs, Ongoing Vaccine, and New Therapeutic Development Initiatives Against COVID-19. As the COVID-19 is still growing throughout the globe, a thorough investigation into the specific immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, its interaction with the host immune system and pathogen evasion mechanism may provide a clear picture of how the pathogen can breach the host immune defenses in elderly patients and patients with comorbid conditions. Such studies will also reveal the underlying mechanism of how children and young patients can withstand the disease better. The study of the immune defense mechanisms and the prolonged immune memory from patients population with convalescent plasma may help in designing a suitable vaccine candidate not only for the current outbreak but also for similar outbreaks in the future. The vital drug candidates, which are being tested as potential vaccines or therapeutics against COVID-19, include live attenuated vaccine, inactivated or killed vaccine, subunit vaccine, antibodies, interferon treatment, repurposing existing drugs, and nucleic acid-based vaccines. Several organizations around the world have fast-tracked the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and some drugs already went to phase III of clinical trials. Hence, here, we have tried to take a quick glimpse of the development stages of vaccines or therapeutic approaches to treat this deadly disease.© Copyright © 2020 Saha, Sharma, Singh, Samanta, Bhakta, Mandal, Bhattacharya, Lee and Chakraborty.	false
0	Universal Screening for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for Asymptomatic Parturients - May Not Be Beneficial At This Time. The current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has spread worldwide and is a significant global health issue. The possible presence of COVID-19 in pregnant patients is a major cause for concern, as historically, other coronaviruses had severe adverse outcomes in this population. Universal Prenatal testing for SARS CoV-2 the causative agent of COVID-19 has been recommended for all pregnant women in the current epicenter, New York City. However, due to the lack of evidence of vertical transmission, teratogenicity, treatment, or change in management of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic patients, this may not be the solution to controlling its spread. False-negative test results may also give inaccurate reassurance in otherwise infectious patients and false-positive tests may result in unnecessary distress and isolation. Universal testing seems more like a Band-Aid and does not seem to have much benefit at this time. Thus, healthcare professionals should continue to wear clean Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when treating all patients and take other precautions to decrease the spread of COVID-19.

0	The Impact of a Physician Clinical Support Supervisor in Supporting Patients and Families, Staff, and the Healthcare System During the COVID-19 Pandemic. As SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) became a pandemic, hospitals actived Hospital Incident Command Systems (HICS). At our institution, we included a role of Physician Clinial Support Supervisor (PCSS) in the HICS structure. The PCSS role was filled by physicians who served hospital leadership positions such as Physician Advisor, Medical Staff leadership, Chief Quality Officer, and Chief Medical Informatics Officer. In an effort to summarize the lessons learned by implementation of the PCSS role during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated a PCSS working Microsoft TeamsTM spreadsheet and the experience of physicians in the PCSS role. Through efficient daily two way communication between front line providers, HICS, and hospital leadership, the PCSS role facilitated rapid change and improved support for frontline staff, patients and families, and the healthcare system. We recommend including the role of PCSS in HICS structure in the event of future pandemics or other crises.	false
0	A Case Report to Assess Passive Immunity in a COVID Positive Pregnant Patient. Introduction Data regarding transplacental passage of maternal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibodies and potential immunity in the newborn is limited. Case Report. We present a 25-year-old multigravida with known red blood cell isoimmunization, who was found to be COVID-19 positive at 27 weeks of gestation while undergoing serial periumbilical blood sampling and intrauterine transfusions. Maternal COVID-19 antibody was detected 2 weeks after positive molecular testing. Antibodies were never detected on cord blood samples from two intrauterine fetal cord blood samples as well as neonatal cord blood at the time of delivery. Conclusion This case demonstrates a lack of passive immunity of COVID-19 antibodies from a positive pregnant woman to her fetus, neither in utero nor at the time of birth. Further studies are needed to understand if passage of antibodies can occur and if that can confer passive immunity in the newborn. Key Points Passive immunity should not be assumed in COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. Isoimmunization may impair passive immunity of certain antibodies. Vaccination to or maternal infection of COVID-19 may not be protective for the fetus.Copyright © by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.	false
0	"AAID White Paper: Management of the Dental Implant Patient During the Coronavirus Pandemic and Beyond. The scientific community's understanding of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted and how to best mitigate its spread is improving daily. To help protect patients from acquiring COVID-19 from a dental office nosocomial infection, many state or local governments have classified dental treatments as ""non-essential"" and put routine dental care on a ""pause"". Dentists have been instructed to only perform ""emergency"" procedures. Unfortunately, there is not a good understanding of what a ""dental emergency"" is amongst governmental leaders. What a government agency may perceive as an ""elective procedure"" may be seen as ""essential"" by the dental clinician responsible for maintaining the oral health of the patient. Each dental specialty understands the effects delayed care has on a patient's oral and systemic health. Dentistry has made extensive progress in improving oral health through prevention of the ""dental emergency"". Today the dental profession must work together to prevent the reversal of the progress dentistry and patients have made to this point."	false

0	Role of Drugs used for chronic disease management on Susceptibility and Severity of COVID-19: A Large Case-Control Study. The study aimed to investigate whether specific medications used in the treatment chronic diseases affected either the development and/ or severity of COVID-19 in a cohort of 610 COVID-19 cases and 48,667 population-based controls from Zheijang, China. Using a cohort of 578 COVID-19 cases and 48,667 population-based controls from Zheijang, China we tested the role of usage of cardiovascular, antidiabetic and other medications on risk and severity of COVID 19. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and BMI and for presence of relevant comorbidities. Individuals with hypertension taking calcium channel blockers had significantly increased risk [odds ratio (OR)= 1.73 (95% CI 1.2-2.3)] of manifesting symptoms of COVID-19 whereas those taking angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics had significantly lower disease risk (OR=0.22; 95%CI 0.15-0.30 and OR=0.30; 95%CI 0.19-0.58 respectively). Among those with type 2 diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (OR= 6.02; 95% CI 2.3-15.5) and insulin (OR= 2.71; 95% CI 1.6-5.5) were more and glucosidase inhibitors were less prevalent (OR= 0.11; 95% CI 0.1-0.3) among with COVID-19 patients. Drugs used in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes influence the risk of development of COVID-19, but, not its severity.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	COVID-19, nausea and vomiting. Exclusion of nausea (N) and vomiting (V) from detailed consideration as symptoms of COVID-19 is surprising as N can be an early presenting symptom. We examined the incidence of NV during infection before defining potential mechanisms. We estimate that the overall incidence of nausea (median 10.5%), although variable, is comparable to diarrhoea. Poor definition of N, confusion with appetite loss, and reporting of N and/or V as a single entity may contribute to reporting variability and likely underestimation. We propose that emetic mechanisms are activated by mediators released from the intestinal epithelium by SARS-CoV-2 modulate vagal afferents projecting to the brainstem and after entry into the blood, activate the area postrema (AP) also implicated in anorexia. The receptor for spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), and transmembrane protease serine (for viral entry) are expressed in upper GI enterocytes, ACE2 is expressed on enteroendocrine cells (EECs), and SARS-CoV-2 infects enterocytes but not EECs (studies needed with native EECs). The resultant virus-induced release of epithelial mediators due to exocytosis, inflammation and apoptosis provides the peripheral and central emetic drives. Additionally, data from SARS-CoV-2 shows an increase in plasma angiotensin II (consequent on SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction), a centrally (AP) acting emetic, providing a further potential mechanism in COVID-19. Viral invasion of the dorsal brainstem is also a possibility but more likely in delayed onset symptoms. Overall, greater attention must be given to nausea as an early symptom of COVID-19 and for the insights provided into the GI effects of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the COVID-19 associated liver injury. Introduction and Objectives: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 5 million people globally. Data on the prevalence and degree of COVID-19 associated liver injury among patients with COVID-19 remain limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence and degree of liver injury between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Method(s): We performed a systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library), from inception to 24th April 2020. We included all adult human studies (>20 subjects) regardless of language, region or publication date or status. We assessed the pooled odds ratio (OR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using the random-effects model. Result(s): Among 1543 citations, there were 24 studies (5961 subjects) which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The pooled odds ratio for elevated ALT (OR = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.6-3.7, I2 = 57%), AST (OR = 3.4, 95%CI: 2.3-5.0, I2 = 56%), hyperbilirubinemia (OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.5, I2 = 0%) and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 7.1, 95%CI: 2.1-24.1, I2 = 71%) were higher subjects in critical COVID-19. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 associated liver injury is more common in severe COVID-19 than non-severe COVID-19. Physicians should be aware of possible progression to severe disease in subjects with COVID-19-associated liver injury.Copyright © 2020 Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur, A.C.	false
0	Efficacy of Povidone-Iodine Nasal and Oral Antiseptic Preparations Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). From the first reported cases in December 2019, the virus has spread to over 4 million people worldwide. Human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through the aerosolization of respiratory droplets. Transmission also occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces and other fomites. Improved antisepsis of human and nonhuman surfaces has been identified as a key feature of transmission reduction. There are no previous studies of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2. This study evaluated nasal and oral antiseptic formulations of PVP-I for virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first report on the efficacy of PVP-I against the virus that causes COVID-19. Method(s): Povidone iodine nasal antiseptic formulations and PVP-I oral rinse antiseptic formulations from 1% to 5% concentrations as well as controls were studied for virucidal efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2. Test compounds were evaluated for ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as measured in a virucidal assay. SARS-CoV-2 was exposed directly to the test compound for 60 seconds, compounds were then neutralized, and surviving virus was quantified. Result(s): All concentrations of nasal antiseptics and oral rinse antiseptics evaluated completely inactivated the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): Nasal and oral PVP-I antiseptic solutions are effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 at a variety of concentrations after 60-second exposure times. The formulations tested may help to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 if used for nasal decontamination, oral decontamination, or surface decontamination in known or suspected cases of COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	How to survive Covid-19 even if the vaccine fails. Covid-19 has created an emergency of epic proportions. While a vaccine may be forthcoming, this is not guaranteed, as discussed herein. The potential problems and ominous signs include: a) Lung injury that developed in animals given an experimental vaccine for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1); b) A perversion of adaptive immune responses called antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) of infection that occurs in SARS-CoV-1 and that may occur in people vaccinated for Covid-19; c) The frequent and recurrent infections that are caused by respiratory coronaviruses; and d) The appearance of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which raise the specter of vaccine escape mutants. Because success is uncertain, alternatives to vaccines need to be vigorously pursued during this critical moment in the pandemic. Alternatives include: a) Engineered monoclonal antibodies that do not cause ADE; b) Cocktails of antiviral drugs and inhibitors of the cellular proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 replication; c) Interferons; and d) Anticoagulants, antioxidants, and immune modulators. To organize and coordinate the systematic investigation of existing therapies and new therapies (as they emerge), a Covid-19 clinical trials network is needed to provide: a) Robust funding (on a par with vaccine funding) and administration; b) An adaptive trial design committee to prioritize interventions and review results in real-time; c) A computer interface to facilitate patient enrollment, make data available to investigators, and present findings; d) A practice guidelines study group; and e) A mobile corps of Covid-19 experts available for rapid deployment to assist local healthcare providers and enroll patients in trials as outbreaks occur. To combat the Covid-19 pandemic and future mass contagions, the network would be a cornerstone of a comprehensive infectious diseases research program.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Reduced Monocytic Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR Expression Indicates Immunosuppression in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients. BACKGROUND: The cellular immune system is of pivotal importance with regard to the response to severe infections. Monocytes/macrophages are considered key immune cells in infections and downregulation of the surface expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) within the major histocompatibility complex class II reflects a state of immunosuppression, also referred to as injury-associated immunosuppression. As the role of immunosuppression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently unclear, we seek to explore the level of mHLA-DR expression in COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): In a preliminary prospective monocentric observational study, 16 COVID-19-positive patients (75% male, median age: 68 [interquartile range 59-75]) requiring hospitalization were included. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score in 9 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory failure was 30 (interquartile range 25-32). Standardized quantitative assessment of HLA-DR on monocytes (cluster of differentiation 14+ cells) was performed using calibrated flow cytometry at baseline (ICU/hospital admission) and at days 3 and 5 after ICU admission. Baseline data were compared to hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULT(S): While normal mHLA-DR expression was observed in all hospitalized noncritically ill patients (n = 7), 89% (8 of 9) critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure showed signs of downregulation of mHLA-DR at ICU admission. mHLA-DR expression at admission was significantly lower in critically ill patients (median, [quartiles]: 9280 antibodies/cell [6114, 16,567]) as compared to the noncritically ill patients (30,900 antibodies/cell [26,777, 52,251]), with a median difference of 21,508 antibodies/cell (95% confidence interval [CI], 14,118-42,971), P =.002. Reduced mHLA-DR expression was observed to persist until day 5 after ICU admission. CONCLUSION(S): When compared to noncritically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease showed reduced mHLA-DR expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes at ICU admission, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. This immunosuppressive (monocytic) phenotype remained unchanged over the ensuing days after ICU admission. Strategies aiming for immunomodulation in this population of critically ill patients should be guided by an immune-monitoring program in an effort to determine who might benefit best from a given immunological intervention.

0	A comprehensive review of COVID-19 characteristics. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or (2019-nCoV) with unknown origin spread in Hubei province of China. The epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The presence of COVID-19 was manifested by several symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to severe illness and death. The viral infection expanded internationally and WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To quickly diagnose and control such a highly infectious disease, suspicious individuals were isolated and diagnostic/treatment procedures were developed through patients' epidemiological and clinical data. Early in the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO invited hundreds of researchers from around the world to develop a rapid quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines, but so far no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine has been approved by the FDA. At present, COVID-19 is managed by available antiviral drugs to improve the symptoms, and in severe cases, supportive care including oxygen and mechanical ventilation is used for infected patients. However, due to the worldwide spread of the virus, COVID-19 has become a serious concern in the medical community. According to the current data of WHO, the number of infected and dead cases has increased to 8,708,008 and 461,715, respectively (Dec 2019 -June 2020). Given the high mortality rate and economic damage to various communities to date, great efforts must be made to produce successful drugs and vaccines against 2019-nCoV infection. For this reason, first of all, the characteristics of the virus, its pathogenicity, and its infectious pathways must be well known. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of this epidemic disease based on the current evidence.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

Despite the widespread implementation of public health measures, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread in the United States. To facilitate an agile response to the pandemic, we developed How We Feel, a web and mobile application that collects longitudinal self-reported survey responses on health, behaviour and demographics. Here, we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from 2 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. We show that self-reported surveys can be used to build predictive models to identify likely COVID-19-positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation; show a variety of exposure, occupational and demographic risk factors for COVID-19 beyond symptoms; reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested; and highlight the temporal dynamics of symptoms and self-isolation behaviour. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, exposure and behavioural self-reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	A network-based explanation of why most COVID-19 infection curves are linear. Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of nonpharmaceutical interventions pushing the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this phase of the pandemic many countries showed an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where either infection numbers grow explosively until herd immunity is reached or the epidemic is completely suppressed. Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, [Formula: see text], below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above [Formula: see text] traditional epidemiological dynamics take place, e.g., as in susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. When calibrating our model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find [Formula: see text] Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular, we compare the United States and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.

0	Mental health amongst obstetrics and gynaecology doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a UK-wide study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom., RESULTS: A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health., CONCLUSIONS: Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.

0	Autoimmunity as the comet tail of COVID-19 pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can give rise to different clinical manifestations that are directly related to viral tissue damage or indirectly induced by the antiviral immune response. Hyper-activation of the immune system in an attempt to eradicate the infection may trigger autoimmunity. Several immune-mediated disorders have been described in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. These include cutaneous rashes and vasculitis, autoimmune cytopenia, anti-phospholipid syndrome, central or peripheral neuropathy, myositis and myocarditis. On the other hand, rheumatic patients were reported to have similar coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence, morbidity and mortality rates compared to general population. This opinion review will summarize the crucial immunologic steps which occur during SARS-CoV-2-infection that may link autoimmunity to COVID-19 and provides an opportunity for further discussion regarding this association.

0	Impact on Mental Health Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Study in Portugal and Brazil. Mental health effects secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic were till recently considered less important or were neglected. Portugal and Brazil are facing the pandemic in quite different ways. This study aimed to describe the mental health status of the general adult population in Portugal and Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the differences between the two countries. A cross-sectional quantitative study was based on an online questionnaire. Socio-demographic data were collected in addition to four validated scales: CAGE (acronym cut-annoyed-guilty-eye) Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-2. For each outcome, a multiple linear regression was performed. Five hundred and fifty people answered the questionnaire (435 women). The median age was 38 (Q1, Q3: 30, 47) years, 52.5% resided in Brazil and 47.5% in Portugal. The prevalence of anxiety was 71.3% (mild anxiety was present in 43.1%), the prevalence of depression was 24.7% and 23.8% of the sample had both depression and anxiety. Isolation was a significant factor for depression but not for anxiety. Well-being was below average. Mental illness was considerably higher than pre-COVID-19 levels. Portugal and Brazil will have to be prepared for future consequences of poor mental health and contribute immediate psychological support to their adult populations.	false
0	Incidence and impact of cardiac arrhythmias in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias may occur in up to 44% of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been associated with an increased risk of death. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 and their implications on patient prognosis., METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, SCOPUS, Europe PMC, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar + Preprint Servers. The primary endpoint of the study was poor outcomes including mortality, severe COVID-19, and the need for ICU care., RESULTS: A total of 4 studies including 784 patients were analyzed. The incidence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 was 19% (9-28%; I2: 91.45). Arrhythmia occurred in 48% (38-57%; I2: 48.08) of patients with poor outcome and 6% (1-12%; I2: 85.33%) of patients without poor outcome. Patients with COVID-19 experiencing arrhythmia had an increased risk of poor outcome (RR 7.96 [3.77, 16.81], p < 0.001; I2: 71.1%). The funnel-plot analysis showed an asymmetrical funnel plot with most of the studies on the right side of the effect estimate. The regression-based Egger's test showed indication of small-study effects (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Cardiac arrhythmias were significantly associated with an increased risk of poor outcome in COVID-19. Arrhythmias were observed in 19% of patients with COVID-19 and in 48% of patients with COVID-19 and poor outcomes. Copyright © 2020 Indian Heart Rhythm Society.

0	Fractured aluminum nasopharyngeal swab during drive-through testing for COVID-19: radiographic detection of a retained foreign body. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the need for safe and efficient testing as a key containment strategy. Drive-through testing with nasopharyngeal swab has been implemented in many places in the USA as it allows for expeditious testing of large numbers of patients, limits healthcare workers' risk of exposure, and minimizes the use of personal protective equipment. We present a case where the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab fractured during specimen collection at a drive-through testing facility and was suspected to have remained in the asymptomatic patient. Initial evaluation with a series of radiographs covering the skull base, neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal the swab. On further clinical evaluation, the swab was found endoscopically, lodged between the left inferior turbinate and nasal floor, and was removed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases. Further evaluation with computed tomography or endoscopy should be considered in suspected cases where radiographs are negative.	false

0	ACE2: Its potential role and regulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19. COVID-19, a new disease caused by the 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has swept the world and challenged its culture, economy, and health infrastructure. Forced emergence to find an effective vaccine to immunize people has led scientists to design and examine vaccine candidates all over the world. Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins. ACE2 also plays a crucial role in lung injury.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	COVID-19 and Venous Thromboembolism: A Meta-analysis of Literature Studies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, leading in some cases to a critical condition with poor long-term outcomes and residual disability requiring post-acute rehabilitation. A major concern in severe COVID-19 is represented by a concomitant prothrombotic state. However, contrasting data are available about the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). A detailed search on the association of COVID-19 with thromboembolic complications was conducted in the main electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The weighted mean prevalence (WMP) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated with the random-effects model. Twenty studies enrolling 1,988 COVID-19 patients were included. The WMP of VTE was 31.3% (95% CI: 24.3-39.2%). The WMP of DVT was 19.8% (95% CI: 10.5-34.0%), whereas the WMP of PE was 18.9% (95% CI: 14.4-24.3%). Similar results were obtained when specifically analyzing studies on patients admitted to intensive care units and those on patients under antithrombotic prophylaxis. Regression models showed that an increasing age was associated with a higher prevalence of VTE (Z-score: 3.11, p=0.001), DVT (Z-score: 2.33, p=0.002), and PE (Z-score: 3.03, p=0.002), while an increasing body mass index was associated with an increasing prevalence of PE (Z-score=2.01, p=0.04). Male sex did not impact the evaluated outcomes. The rate of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients is definitely high. Considering the risk of fatal and disabling complications, adequate screening procedures and antithrombotic strategies should be implemented.Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false

BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) reported 170,639 cases and 1430 deaths from COVID-19 since the first case emerged in the country on March 2 through June 25, 2020. The objective of this report is to describe the characteristics and outcome observed among 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest academic hospital in KSA, and assess co-infection with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). METHOD(S): This single-center case series data included select epidemiological, clinical, radiological features and laboratory findings of all confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC), Riyadh, KSA, from March 22 until May 31, 2020, followed through June 6, 2020. We conducted retrospective analysis of listed data from 99 hospitalized patients and present characteristics and factors associated with severity in percentages and univariate odds ratios. Cases were confirmed using nasopharyngeal or throat swab by real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. RESULT(S): The 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in this analysis constitute 16% of 632 positive SARS-CoV-2 among 6633 persons who were tested at the KSUMC (positivity rate, 9.4%). MERS-CoV PCR was negative in all 99 patients tested. The majority of these 99 hospitalized patients were males (66%), had a mean age of 44 years (range, 19-87), and a quarter (25.3%) were health care workers. Patients with comorbid conditions accounted for 52.5% of patients including the 8.1% who were asymptomatic; diabetes mellitus being the most frequent (31.3%), followed by hypertension (22.2%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (67.7%), cough (60.6%), dyspnea (43.4%), upper respiratory symptoms (27.3%), fatigue (26.3%), diarrhea (19.2%) and loss of smell (9.1%). The clinical conditions among these 99 patients included upper respiratory tract infection (47.5%), abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers a fifth (21%) of patients had moderate pneumonia, while 7% had severe pneumonia with 22.2% requiring admission to the intensive care unit and 12.1% died. Late presentation with severe disease, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin), and end organ damage (high creatinine or high aspartate aminotransferase) were predictors for admission to critical care unit or died. CONCLUSION(S): We observed no MERS-CoV co-infection in this early cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were relatively young, more than half had comorbid conditions, presented with fever and/or cough, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, and high inflammatory markers. Given MERS-CoV endemicity in the country, co-monitoring of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection is critical.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press International B.V.	false
0	Evidence-Based Risk Mitigation and Stratification During COVID-19 for Return to Interventional Pain Practice: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) Guidelines. BACKGROUND: Chronic pain patients require continuity of care even during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed healthcare and other societal practices. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-ASIPP Risk Mitigation & Stratification (COVID-ARMS) Return to Practice Task Force in order to provide guidance for safe and strategic reopening. OBJECTIVE(S): The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. METHOD(S): The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. RESULT(S): Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. LIMITATIONS: COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. CONCLUSION(S): Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis. Pain specialists may return to practice with lower-risk patients and appropriate safeguards.	false
0	Using BCG vaccine to enhance non-specific protection of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in Denmark. OBJECTIVES: The Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis is associated with non- specific protective effects against other infections, and significant reductions in all-cause morbidity and mortality have been reported. We aim to test whether BCG vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers (HCW) and thus prevent work absenteeism.The primary objective is to reduce absenteeism due to illness among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are to reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to reduce the number of hospital admissions among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPOTHESIS: BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months. TRIAL DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, recruiting study participants at several geographic locations. The BCG vaccine is used in this study on a different indication than the one it has been approved for by the Danish Medicines Agency, therefore this is classified as a phase III study. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 1,500 HCW at Danish hospitals.To be eligible for participation, a subject must meet the following criteria: Adult (>=18 years); Hospital personnel working at a participating hospital for more than 22 hours per week.A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Known allergy to components of the BCG vaccine or serious adverse events to prior BCG administration Known prior active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) or other mycobacterial species Previous confirmed COVID-19 Fever (>38 C) within the past 24 hours Suspicion of active viral or bacterial infection Pregnancy Breastfeeding Vaccination with other live attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks Severely immunocompromised subjects. This exclusion category comprises: a) subjects with known infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) b) subjects with solid organ transplantation c) subjects with bone marrow transplantation d) subjects under chemotherapy e) subjects with primary immunodeficiency f) subjects under treatment with any anti-cytokine therapy within the last year g) subjects under treatment with oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for longer than 3 months h) Active solid or non-solid malignancy or lymphoma within the prior two years Direct involvement in the design or the execution of the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines, Copenhagen, Denmark) or placebo (saline). An adult dose of 0.1 ml of resuspended BCG vaccine (intervention) or 0.1 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (control) is administered intradermally in the upper deltoid area of the right arm. All participants will receive one injection at inclusion, and no further treatment of study participants will take place. MAIN OUTCOMES: Main study endpoint: Days of unplanned absenteeism due to illness within 180 days of randomisation.Secondary study endpoints: The cumulative incidence of documented COVID-19 and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission for any reason within 180 days of randomisation.Randomisation: Randomisation will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification by hospital, sex and age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in random blocks of 4 and 6. The allocation ratio is 1:1.Blinding (masking): Participants will be blinded to treatment. The participant will be asked to leave the room while the allocated treatment is prepared. Once ready for injection, vaccine and placebo will look similar, and the participant will not be able to tell the difference.The physicians administering the treatment are not blinded.Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size: N=1,500. The 1,500 participants will be randomised 1:1 to BCG or placebo with 750 participants in each group.Trial Status: Current protocol version 5.1, from July 6, 2020.Recruitment of study participants started on May 18, 2020 and we anticipate having finished recruiting by the end of December 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with EudraCT on April 16, 2020, EudraCT number: 2020-001888-90, and with ClinicalTrials.gov on May 1, 2020, registration number NCT04373291.Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trialswebsite (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.	false
0	Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality. The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries at any given time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy, Germany, Spain, and New York City over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late June 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 14.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two-thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 14.0% between March 9 and June 30, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well-designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.	false
0	Pooling saliva to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. Expanding testing capabilities is integral to managing the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and developing reopening strategies, particularly in regards to identifying and isolating asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Central to meeting testing demands are specimens that can be easily and reliably collected and laboratory capacity to rapidly ramp up to scale. We and others have demonstrated that high and consistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in saliva from COVID-19 inpatients, outpatients, and asymptomatic individuals. As saliva collection is non-invasive, extending this strategy to test pooled saliva samples from multiple individuals could thus provide a simple method to expand testing capacity. However, hesitation towards pooled sample testing arises due to the dilution of positive samples, potentially shifting weakly positive samples below the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 and thereby decreasing the sensitivity. Here, we investigated the potential of pooling saliva samples by 5, 10, and 20 samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on samples tested, we conservatively estimated a reduction of 7.41%, 11.11%, and 14.81% sensitivity, for each of the pool sizes, respectively. Using these estimates we modeled anticipated changes in RT-qPCR cycle threshold to show the practical impact of pooling on results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. In tested populations with greater than 3% prevalence, testing samples in pools of 5 requires the least overall number of tests. Below 1% however, pools of 10 or 20 are more beneficial and likely more supportive of ongoing surveillance strategies.	false
0	Potential Community and Campus Covid-19 Outcomes Under University and College Reopening Scenarios. BACKGROUND: Significant uncertainty exists about the safety of, and best strategies for, reopening colleges and universities while the Covid-19 pandemic is not well-controlled. Little also is known about the effects that on-campus outbreaks may have on local non-student and/or higher-risk communities. Model-based analysis can help inform decision and policy making across a wide range of assumptions and uncertainties., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential range of campus and community Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality due to various university and college reopening plans and precautions., METHODS: We developed and calibrated campus-only, community-only, and campus-x-community epidemic models using standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered differential equation and agent-based modeling methods. Input parameters for campus and surrounding communities were estimated via published and grey literature, scenario development, expert opinion, Monte Carlo simulation, and accuracy optimization algorithms; models were cross-validated against each other using February-June 2020 county, state, and country data. Campus opening plans (spanning various fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites, publications, communications, and surveys. All scenarios were simulated assuming 16-week semesters and best/worst case ranges for disease prevalence among community residents and arriving students, precaution compliance, contact frequency, virus attack rates, and tracing and isolation effectiveness. Day-to-day student and community differences in exposures, infections, and mortality were estimated under each scenario as compared to regular and no re-opening; 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals were computed to omit extreme outlier scenarios. Factorial analyses were conducted to identify inputs with largest and smallest impacts on outcomes., RESULTS: As a base case, predicted 16-week student infections and mortality under normal operations with no precautions (or no compliance) ranged from 472 to 9,484 (4.7% to 94.8%) and 2 to 61 (0.02% to 0.61%) per 10,000 student population, respectively. In terms of contact tracing and isolation resources, as many as 17 to 1,488 total exposures per 10,000 students could occur on a given day throughout the semester needing to be located, tested, and if warranted quarantined. Attributable total additional predicted community exposures, infections, and mortality ranged from 1 to 187, 13 to 820, and 1 to 21, respectively, assuming the university takes no additional precautions to limit exposure risk. The mean (SD) number of days until 1% and 5% of on-campus students are infected was 11 (3) and 76 (17) days, respectively; 34.8% of replications resulted in more than 10% students infected by semester end. The diffusion first inflection point occurred on average on day 84 (+/- 20 days, 95% interval). Common re-opening precaution strategies reduced the above consequences by 24% to 26% fewer infections (now 360 to 6,976 per 10,000 students) and 36% to 50% fewer deaths (now 1 to 39 per 10,000 students). Perfect testing and immediate quarantining of all students on arrival to campus at semester start further reduced infections by 58% to 95% (now 200 to 468 per 10,000 students) and deaths by 95% to 100% (now 0 to 3 per 10,000 students). Uncertainties in many factors, however, produced tremendous variability in all median estimates, ranging by -67% to +370%., CONCLUSIONS: Consequences of reopening college and university physical campuses on student and community Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality are very highly unpredictable, depending on a combination of random chance, controllable (e.g. physical layouts), and uncontrollable (e.g. human behavior) factors. Important implications at government and academic institution levels include clear needs for specific criteria to adapt campus operations mid-semester, methods to detect when this is necessary, and well-executed contingency plans for doing so.	false
0	Psychiatric presentation of patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective review of 50 consecutive patients seen by a consultation-liaison psychiatry team. BACKGROUND: Reports of psychiatric morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection tend to be limited by geography and patients' clinical status. Representative samples are needed to inform service planning and research., AIMS: To describe the psychiatric morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction) in referrals to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service in Qatar., METHOD: Retrospective review of 50 consecutive referrals., RESULTS: Most patients were male. Median age was 39.5 years. Thirty-one patients were symptomatic (upper respiratory tract symptoms or pneumonia) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 19 were asymptomatic (no characteristic physical symptoms of COVID-19 infection). Seventeen patients (34%) had a past psychiatric history including eight with bipolar I disorder or psychosis, all of whom relapsed. Thirty patients (60%) had physical comorbidity. The principal psychiatric diagnoses made by the consultation-liaison team were delirium (n = 13), psychosis (n = 9), acute stress reaction (n = 8), anxiety disorder (n = 8), depression (n = 8) and mania (n = 8). Delirium was confined to the COVID-19 symptomatic group (the exception being one asymptomatic patient with concurrent physical illness). The other psychiatric diagnoses spanned the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID. One patient with COVID-19 pneumonia experienced an ischaemic stroke. Approximately half the patients with mania and psychosis had no past psychiatric history. Three patients self-harmed. The commonest psychiatric symptoms were sleep disturbance (70%), anxiety (64%), agitation (50%), depressed mood (42%) and irritability (36%)., CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of psychiatric morbidity is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and is seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Cases of psychosis and mania represented relapses in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and also new onset cases.	false
0	Comparison of Chest Ultrasound and Standard X-Ray Imaging in COVID-19 Patients. Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges for the medical community due to its large number of patients presenting with varying symptoms. Chest ultrasound (ChUS) may be particularly useful in the early clinical management in suspected COVID-19 patients due to its broad availability and rapid application. We aimed to investigate patterns of ChUS in COVID-19 patients and compare the findings with results from chest X-ray (CRX)., Materials and Methods: 24 patients (18 symptomatic, 6 asymptomatic) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction underwent bedside ChUS in addition to CRX following admission. Subsequently, the results of ChUS and CRX were compared., Results: 94% (n=17/18) of patients with respiratory symptoms demonstrated lung abnormalities on ChUS. ChUS was especially useful to detect interstitial syndrome compared to CXR in COVID-19 patients (17/18 vs. 11/18; p<0.02). Of note, ChUS also detected lung consolidations very effectively (14/18 for ChUS vs. 7/18 cases for CXR; p<0.02). Besides pathological B-lines and subpleural consolidations, pleural line abnormality (89%; n=16/18) was the third most common feature in patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 detected by ChUS., Conclusion: Our findings support the high value of ChUS in the management of COVID-19 patients.	false
0	The Incidence, Risk Factors, and Prognosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Adult Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred and has rapidly spread worldwide. However, little information is available about the AKI in COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of AKI in adult patients with COVID-19., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1392 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were extracted from electronic hospitalization and laboratory databases. AKI was defined and staged according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Risk factors for AKI and the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 7% (99 of 1392) of patients developed AKI during hospitalization, 40% (40 of 99) of which occurred within 1 week of admission. Factors associated with a higher risk of AKI include severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 3.67), higher baseline serum creatinine (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.11), lymphopenia (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.53), and elevated D-dimer level (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.70). The in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 was 62%, 77%, and 80%, respectively. AKI was associated with in-hospital mortality even after adjustment for confounders (OR, 5.12; 95% CI, 2.70 to 9.72)., CONCLUSIONS: AKI is uncommon but carries high in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

0	Convalescent plasma for pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. There are no proven safe and effective therapies for children who develop life-threatening complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Convalescent plasma (CP) has demonstrated potential benefit in adults with SARS-CoV-2, but has theoretical risks. We present the first report of CP in children with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), providing data on four pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We measured donor antibody levels and recipient antibody response prior to and following CP infusion. Infusion of CP was not associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and did not suppress endogenous antibody response. We found CP was safe and possibly efficacious. Randomized pediatric trials are needed. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	Chinese therapeutic strategy for fighting COVID-19 and potential small-molecule inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 20 million people infected worldwide with an average mortality rate of 3.6%. This virus poses major challenges to public health, as it not only is highly contagious but also can be transmitted by asymptomatic infected individuals. COVID-19 is clinically difficult to manage due to a lack of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines. In this article, Chinese therapy strategies for treating COVID-19 patients, including current applications of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, 72 small molecules from natural products and TCM with reported antiviral activity against human coronaviruses (CoVs) are identified from published literature, and their potential applications in combating SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Among these, the clinical efficacies of some accessible drugs such as remdesivir (RDV) and favipiravir (FPV) for COVID-19 are emphatically summarized. We hope this review provides a foundation for managing the worsening pandemic and developing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Upper respiratory viral load in asymptomatic individuals and mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have viable viral loads and have been linked to several transmission cases. However, data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking. We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID-19., METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID-19 in South Korea. The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire-based survey. Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the E, RdRp and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 40 for determining positivity., RESULTS: In 213 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 41 (19%) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission; of them, 39 (95%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing after a median 13 days. In 172 symptomatic patients, 144 (84%) underwent follow-up RT-PCR testing. Twenty-one (54%) asymptomatic individuals and 92 (64%) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up. Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E (31.15 vs 31.43; p>0.99), RdRp (32.26 vs 32.93; p=0.92) and N (33.05 vs 33.28; p>0.99) genes., CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic, and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients. A large proportion of mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 or asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 showed persistent positive upper respiratory RT-PCR results at follow-up.

0	Increased respiratory viral detection and symptom burden among patients with primary antibody deficiency: results from the BIPAD study. BACKGROUND: Patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) are at increased risk of respiratory tract infections but our understanding of their nature and consequences remains limited. OBJECTIVE(S): To define the symptomatic and microbial burden of upper airway infection in adults with PAD relative to age-matched controls. METHOD(S): Prospective 12-month observational study consisting of a daily upper and lower airway symptom score alongside fortnightly nasal swab with molecular detection of 19 pathogen targets. RESULT(S): 44 patients and 42 controls (including 34 household pairs) were recruited, providing over 22,500 days of symptom scores and 1,496 nasal swabs. Swab and questionnaire compliance exceeded 70%. At enrolment, 64% of patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a 34% prevalence of bronchiectasis. On average, PAD patients experienced symptomatic respiratory exacerbations every 6 days compared to 6 weeks for controls, associated with significant impairment of respiratory-specific quality of life scores. Viral detections were associated with worsening of symptom scores from a participant's baseline. PAD patients had increased odds ratio (OR) for pathogen detection, particularly viral (OR 2.73; 95% CI: 2.09 to 3.57), specifically human rhinovirus HRV (OR 3.60; 2.53-5.13), and parainfluenza (OR 3.06; 1.25-7.50). H. influenzae and S. pneumonia were also more frequent in PAD. Young child exposure, IgM deficiency, and presence of bronchiectasis were independent risk factors for viral detection. Prophylactic antibiotic use was associated with a lower risk of bacterial detection by PCR. CONCLUSION(S): PAD patients have a significant respiratory symptom burden associated with increased viral infection frequency despite immunoglobulin replacement and prophylactic antibiotic use. This highlights a clear need for future therapeutic trials in the PAD-population, and informs future study design.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Expert Consensus for Treating Cancer Patients During the Pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. The sudden pandemic of SARS-Cov-2 (also known as novel coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) poses a severe threat to hundreds of millions of lives in the world. The complete cure of the virus largely relies on the immune system, which becomes particularly a challenge for the cancer subjects, whose immunity is generally compromised. However, in a constant evolving situation, the clinical data on the prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 for cancer patients is still limited. On top of a wide range of medical references and interim guidelines including CDC, NCI, ASCO, ESMO, NCCN, AACR, ESMO, and the National Health Commission of China, etc., we formed into a guideline based on our experience in our specialized cancer hospital in Wuhan, the originally endemic center of the virus. Furthermore, we formulated an expert consensus which was developed by all contributors from different disciplines after fully discussion based on our understanding and analysis of limited information of COVID-19. The consensus highlighted a multidisciplinary team diagnostic model with assessment of the balance between risks and benefits prior to treatment, individualizing satisfaction of patients' medical needs, and acceptability in ethics and patients' socio-economic conditions.© Copyright © 2020 Dong, Luo, Hu, Zhang, Cai, Qian, Ran, Ou, Wang, Huang, Ren, Han, Zhang, Wei, Liang, Xu, Wang, Shi, Wei and Hu.	false
0	Complicated appendicitis are common during the epidemic period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of complicated appendicitis (including gangrene, abscess and perforation) after the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and to identify the risk factors associated with complicated appendicitis. METHOD(S): Two groups were established in the study consisting of: one group for cases of acute appendicitis before the 2019-nCoV epidemic (before January 1, 2020; pre-epidemic group) and another group for those after the epidemic outbreak (after January 1, 2020; epidemic group). These two groups were compared in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, prevalence of complicated appendicitis, and treatment intention. A multivariate analysis model using binary logistic regression was constructed. RESULT(S): A total of 163 patients were included in this study, with 105 in the pre-epidemic group and 58 in the epidemic group. In the epidemic group, the interval from the onset of symptoms to admission was 65.0 h, which is significantly longer than the 17.3 h interval noted in the pre-epidemic group (P < 0.001). The prevalence of complicated appendicitis after the epidemic outbreak was significantly higher than before the outbreak (51.7% vs. 12.4%, P < 0.001). In addition, the epidemic group had a lower score of patient's intention to seek treatment than the pre-epidemic group (9.5 +/- 2.7 vs. 3.4 +/- 2.6, P < 0.001). Based on the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for complicated appendicitis included the time from symptoms onset to admission (OR = 1.075) and the patients' intention to receive treatment (OR = 0.541). CONCLUSION(S): Complicated appendicitis was more common in patients with acute appendicitis after the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.	false
0	"Particulate Alum via Pickering Emulsion for an Enhanced COVID-19 Vaccine Adjuvant. For rapid response against the prevailing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19), it is a global imperative to exploit the immunogenicity of existing formulations for safe and efficient vaccines. As the most accessible adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (alum) is still the sole employed adjuvant in most countries. However, alum tends to attach on the membrane rather than entering the dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the absence of intracellular transfer and process of the antigens, and thus limits T-cell-mediated immunity. To address this, alum is packed on the squalene/water interphase is packed, forming an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE). ""Inheriting"" from alum and squalene, PAPE demonstrates a good biosafety profile. Intriguingly, with the dense array of alum on the oil/water interphase, PAPE not only adsorbs large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antigens, but also harbors a higher affinity for DC uptake, which provokes the uptake and cross-presentation of the delivered antigens. Compared with alum-treated groups, more than six times higher antigen-specific antibody titer and three-fold more IFN-gamma-secreting T cells are induced, indicating the potent humoral and cellular immune activations. Collectively, the data suggest that PAPE may provide potential insights toward a safe and efficient adjuvant platform for the enhanced COVID-19 vaccinations.Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH."	false
0	Inhaled and systemic heparin as a repurposed direct antiviral drug for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we advocate a highly favourable opportunity for the treatment of COVID-19 disease by repurposing a long-serving medical agent with an excellent history of clinical use, namely heparin. Heparin is best known as an anticoagulant, but it also exhibits direct antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses and has anti-inflammatory activity. The high incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients suggests that coagulopathy plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. This already makes heparin a unique, potentially curative agent that can be used immediately to help resolve the ongoing crisis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate here in vitro that heparin does indeed inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three concurrent modes of activity of heparin (antiviral, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory) against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 form a unique therapeutic combination. Thus, repurposing of heparin to fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 appears to be a powerful, readily available measure to address the current pandemic.Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	Covid-19 pandemic: from carnival masks to surgical masks. Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on our health system. Even in developed countries, strategic resources soon become insufficient. Although people over 60 and with comorbidities are at greater risk of developing severe forms, younger people may also require precious and scarce care. Hence, the World Health Organization recommend tests - PCR and serological tests - for detecting infected people on a large scale. The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia, and dyspnea, with tomographic pulmonary findings being frequent even in asymptomatic cases. The Brazilian Society of Nephrology has published guidelines for the management of hypertensive, diabetic, dialysis, and transplant patients. In its alerts, care and precautions in dialysis units are also being detailed, both for the health team and for the patients. Although important renal manifestations are not yet evident in the admission of positive cases, recent studies with renal patients and performed in nephrology services are listed here. This pandemic lead us to learn from its progress in order to face new challenges in dialysis clinics, transplant services, and intensive care services.	false

0	Plasma Exchange: An Effective Rescue Therapy in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection. OBJECTIVES: Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 can induce uncontrolled systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate if plasma exchange, through the removal of circulating mediators, can be used as rescue therapy in these patients. DESIGN: Single center case series. SETTING: Local study. SUBJECTS: Four critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 19 pneumonia that failed conventional interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma exchange. Two to six sessions (1.2 plasma volumes). Human albumin (5%) was used as the main replacement fluid. Fresh frozen plasma and immunoglobulins were administered after each session to avoid coagulopathy and hypogammaglobulinemia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum markers of inflammation and macrophage activation. All patients showed a dramatic reduction in inflammatory markers, including the main cytokines, and improved severity scores after plasma exchange. All survived to ICU admission. CONCLUSION(S): Plasma exchange mitigates cytokine storm, reverses organ failure, and could improve survival in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection.	false
0	Quantum Dot-Conjugated SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudo-Virions Enable Tracking of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 Binding and Endocytosis. The first step of SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the spike protein's receptor binding domain to the host cell's ACE2 receptor on the plasma membrane. Here, we have generated a versatile imaging probe using recombinant Spike receptor binding domain conjugated to fluorescent quantum dots (QDs). This probe is capable of engaging in energy transfer quenching with ACE2-conjugated gold nanoparticles to enable monitoring of the binding event in solution. Neutralizing antibodies and recombinant human ACE2 blocked quenching, demonstrating a specific binding interaction. In cells transfected with ACE2-GFP, we observed immediate binding of the probe on the cell surface followed by endocytosis. Neutralizing antibodies and ACE2-Fc fully prevented binding and endocytosis with low nanomolar potency. Importantly, we will be able to use this QD nanoparticle probe to identify and validate inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 receptor binding in human cells. This work enables facile, rapid, and high-throughput cell-based screening of inhibitors for coronavirus Spike-mediated cell recognition and entry.	false
0	Presenteeism in nurses: comparative study of Spanish, Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. AIM: To compare presenteeism levels among three samples of nurses and to identify the relationship between presenteeism and sociodemographic and professional characteristics. BACKGROUND: Presenteeism (going to work ill) is a phenomenon studied from different perspectives, and it has become especially important during the current COVID-19 outbreak; its connection to high healthcare costs, patient safety breaches and negative nurse well-being has been proved. INTRODUCTION: The nursing profession is particularly associated with caring for the culture of teamwork, loyalty to colleagues and professional identity. This condition enhances the 'super nurse phenomenon', even though nurses do not feel physically and psychologically able to work. METHOD(S): A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted in three different country contexts: Oviedo (Spain), Porto (Portugal) and Sao Paulo (Brazil). Nurses performing functions in hospitals and primary health care were enrolled. Informed consent and data collection questionnaires were hand delivered. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6 was applied. RESULT(S): A total of 659 nurses participated. Portuguese nurses showed greater prevalence of presenteeism, followed by Brazilian and Spanish nurses. Younger nurses with less professional experience presented lower levels of presenteeism but greater psychological commitment. Male participants showed lower capacity to complete work when ill than female participants. CONCLUSION(S): Age and length of professional experience proved to be significant predictors of total presenteeism, although only professional experience revealed statistical significance in the adjusted model. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The knowledge of this phenomenon among nurses highlights the need for the development of strategies in the curriculum of nursing students and organizations. Resilience and ergonomic training should be applied in the training programmes of the students and reinforced by the health centre managers. It is essential that healthcare systems design worksite wellness programmes that pursue greater physical and mental well-being for healthcare professionals.Copyright © 2020 International Council of Nurses.	false
0	Survey of prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among 1124 healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic across India. Background: A prospective study was conducted during the second phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers (HCWs) and factors that influence the outcome. Method(s): A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1124 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020). Demographic data, questions on COVID-19 and scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were analysed using the chi-square test (Bonferroni correction) and binary logistic regression. Result(s): The study consists of 1124 HCWs, including 749 doctors, 207 nurses, 135 paramedics, 23 administrators and ten supporting staff members. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were reported as 37.2% and 31.4%, respectively. The risk factors for anxiety were female gender (30.6% vs 45.5%), age group (20-35 years) (50.4% vs 61.2%), unmarried (21.2% vs 30.6%) and job profile (nurse) (14.7% vs 26.4%). The protective factor was having service of more than 20 years (23.4% vs 14.8%). The risk factors for depression were age group (20-35 years) (51.3% vs 61.3%) and employed at a primary care hospital (16.2% vs 23.4%). The protective factors were job profile (doctor) (69.9% vs 59.6%) and having service of more than 20 years (22.3% vs 15.5%). Conclusion(s): Approximately one-third of the HCWs reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The risk factors for anxiety symptoms were female gender, younger age and job profile (nurse) and for depressive symptoms were younger age and working at a primary care hospital. Future research studies should identify strategies for providing a safer and supportive work environment for HCWs to face epidemics/pandemics.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Predictive effects of IgA and IgG combination to assess pulmonary exudation progression in COVID-19 patients. Our study intended to longitudinally explore the prediction effect of IgA on pulmonary exudation progression in COVID-19 patients. The serum IgA was tested with chemiluminescence method. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model was used to extrapolate the IgA levels before hospital admission. The positive rate of IgA and IgG in our cohort was 97% and 79.0%. The IgA was peaked in 10-15 days after admission, and IgG was peaked at the time of admission time while HRCT and chest PA & LAT (posteroanterior oblique and lateral views) were peaked in 20-25 days after admission. We found that the time difference between their peaks was about 10 days. Viral RNA detection results showed that the positive rate in sputum and feces were the highest. Blood gas analysis showed that deterioration of hypoxia with the enlargement of pulmonary exudation area. And alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2) and oxygenation index were correlated with IgA and IgG. The results of biopsy showed that the epithelium of lung was exfoliated and the mucosa was edematous. In severe COVID-19 patients, the combination of IgA and IgG can predict the progress of pulmonary lesions and is closely related to hypoxemia and both also play an important defense role in invasion and destruction of bronchial and alveolar epithelium by SARS-CoV-2.

0	Pediatric Anesthesia During the Coronavirus Disease Epidemic One Pediatric Surgical Hospital's Rapid Transition Back to Care. Shriners Hospitals for Children - Northern California provides highly specialized pediatric surgical care. The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required timely suspension of our elective surgeries. Mitigating disease spread and protecting patients and staff became paramount. Because pediatric patients in particular carry and may spread SARS-CoV-2 while asymptomatic, and due to the large amount of respiratory aerosols produced during airway manipulation, an unprecedented risk of provider infection came to exist. Surgical cases were tiered based on urgency and only emergent or urgent cases proceeded using airborne precaution personal protective equipment (PPE)1. Furthermore, asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing surgery have higher postoperative morbidity and mortality2. However, surgery in children is rarely completely elective and could not be postponed indefinitely. The ability to resume pediatric surgical care during this pandemic would only be possible if a completely new path was forged.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	The spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Africa. Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Although, the disease appeared in Africa later than other regions, it has now spread to virtually all countries on the continent. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyse the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notably high incidence in neighbouring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100 000) mostly impacted Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden. These findings could be useful in guiding epidemiological interventions and the allocation of scarce resources based on heterogeneity of the disease patterns.	false
0	Clusters of COVID-19 associated with Purim celebration in the Jewish community in Marseille, France, March 2020. OBJECTIVES: We investigated possible COVID-19 epidemic clusters and their common sources of exposure that led to a sudden increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Jewish community of Marseille between March 15 and March 20, 2020. METHOD(S): All data were generated as part of routine work at Marseille university hospitals. Biological diagnoses were made by RT-PCR testing. A telephone survey of families in which a laboratory confirmed case was diagnosed was conducted to determine possible exposure events. RESULT(S): As of March 30, 2020, 63 patients were linked to 6 epidemic clusters. The 6 clusters were linked to religious and social activities: a ski trip, organized meals for the Purim Jewish celebration in community and family settings on March 10, a religious service and a charity gala. Notably, 40% of the patients were infected by index patients during the presymptomatic period, which was 2.5 days before symptom onset. When considering household members, all 12 patients who tested negative and who did not develop any relevant clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were 1-16 years of age. The clinical attack rate (symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and biologically confirmed by PCR) in adults was 85% compared to 26% in children. CONCLUSION(S): Family and community gatherings for the Purim Jewish celebration probably accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in the Marseille Jewish community, leading to multiple epidemic clusters. This investigation of family clusters suggested that all close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were not infected were children.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	Estimation of Viral Aerosol Emissions From Simulated Individuals With Asymptomatic to Moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019. This mathematical modeling study estimates viral aerosol emissions from simulated individuals with asymptomatic to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Question What is the estimated viral load released from an individual with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by breathing and coughing, and what is the resulting concentration in a room? Findings In this mathematical modeling study, breathing and coughing by a simulated individual with COVID-19 were estimated to release large numbers of viruses in a poorly ventilated room with a coughing person. However, the estimated infectious risk posed by a person with typical viral load who breathes normally was low, and only few people with very high viral load posed an infection risk in a poorly ventilated closed environment. Meaning These results may partially explain the observed rates of transmission and suggest that there is a need for strict respiratory protection when people are in the same room with an individual with COVID-19. Importance Individuals with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported to frequently transmit the disease even without direct contact. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum samples from such individuals. Objective To estimate the virus levels released from individuals with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and to determine what exposure could result from this in a room shared with such individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants This mathematical modeling study combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath microdroplets for coughing and normal breathing with viral swab and sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. Viral data were obtained from studies published as of May 20, 2020. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50 m(3), the size of a small office or medical examination room. Main Outcomes and Measures Modeling was used to estimate the viral load emitted by individuals breathing normally or coughing, and the concentrations expected in the simulated room at different ventilation rates. Results The mean estimated viral load in microdroplets emitted by simulated individuals while breathing regularly was 0.0000049 copies/cm(3), with a range of 0.0000000049 to 0.637 copies/cm(3). The corresponding estimates for simulated coughing individuals were a mean of 0.277 copies/cm(3)per cough, with a range of 0.000277 to 36 030 copies/cm(3)per cough. The estimated concentrations in a room with an individual who was coughing frequently were very high, with a maximum of 7.44 million copies/m(3)from an individual who was a high emitter. However, regular breathing from an individual who was a high emitter was modeled to result in lower room concentrations of up to 1248 copies/m(3). Conclusions and Relevance In this modeling study, breathing and coughing were estimated to release large numbers of viruses, ranging from thousands to millions of virus copies per cubic meter in a room with an individual with COVID-19 with a high viral load, depending on ventilation and microdroplet formation process. The estimated infectious risk posed by a person with typical viral load who breathes normally was low. The results suggest that only few people with very high viral load pose an infection risk in poorly ventilated closed environments. These findings suggest that strict respiratory protection may be needed when there is a chance to be in the same small room with an individual, whether symptomatic or not, especially for a prolonged period.	false
0	Pediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units in Brazil: a prospective multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of children and adolescents admitted to intensive care with confirmed COVID-19., METHOD: Prospective, multicenter, observational study, in 19 pediatric intensive care units. Patients aged 1 month to 19 years admitted consecutively (March-May 2020) were included. Demographic, clinical-epidemiological features, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Subgroups were compared according to comorbidities, age < 1year, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for predictors of severity., RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were included (ten with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome). Median age 4 years; 54% male (multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, 80%); 41% had comorbidities (multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, 20%). Fever (76%), cough (51%), and tachypnea (50%) were common in both groups. Severe symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and higher inflammatory markers were more frequent in multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Interstitial lung infiltrates were common in both groups, but pleural effusion was more prevalent in the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome group (43% vs. 14%). Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 18% (median 7.5 days); antibiotics, oseltamivir, and corticosteroids were used in 76%, 43%, and 23%, respectively, but not hydroxychloroquine. The median pediatric intensive care unit length-of-stay was five days; there were two deaths (3%) in the non- multisystemic inflammatory syndrome group. Patients with comorbidities were older and comorbidities were independently associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.5; 95% CI, 1.43-21.12; p=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In Brazilian pediatric intensive care units, COVID-19 had low mortality, age less than 1year was not associated with a worse prognosis, and patients with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome had more severe symptoms, higher inflammatory biomarkers, and a greater predominance of males, but only comorbidities and chronic diseases were independent predictors of severity.

0	Reduction in Skin Cancer Diagnoses in the UK during COVID-19 Pandemic. The UK healthcare system has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic, including skin cancer departments. Despite service capacity and a worldwide increase in incidence, anecdotal reports suggest a decline in skin cancer diagnoses following COVID-19. To determine if there is a decrease in skin cancer diagnosis in the UK in the COVID-19 era, we analysed data from the Northern Cancer Network from March 23rd 2020 to June 23rd 2020 and compared it to the same period last year. In the COVID Period there was a decrease in skin cancer diagnoses of 68.61% from 3619 to 1136 (p<0.0028). Surprisingly, skin cancer waiting times were also reduced in the COVID Period compared to Before COVID Period (median 8 days and 12 days respectively; p<0.0001). Collectively these data highlight a statistically significant reduction in both skin cancer diagnoses and waiting times during the COVID Period.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Saliva sample pooling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. As the battle against coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues, an increase in workload and medical expenses have been a concern to the health care system worldwide. Developing a measure that helps to conserve the health care resource is, therefore, highly desirable, and the pooling of the specimens for testing is one of the attractive strategies. Recently we showed that saliva could be a potential alternative specimen for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the present study, we performed the pooling of saliva specimens for testing by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. We showed that the saliva pool of either five or ten samples, by allowing the detection of either gene in the pool at an increased cycle threshold cut-off value, further performing individual sample testing in the positive pools did not compromise the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

0	SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Antigen-Detecting Half-Strip Lateral Flow Assay Toward the Development of Point of Care Tests Using Commercially Available Reagents. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing to enable the efficient treatment and mitigation of COVID-19. The primary diagnostic tool currently employed is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can have good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Unfortunately, implementation costs and logistical problems with reagents during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have hindered its universal on demand adoption. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent a class of diagnostic that, if sufficiently clinically sensitive, may fill many of the gaps in the current RT-PCR testing regime, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, many serology LFAs have been developed, though none meet the performance requirements necessary for diagnostic use cases, primarily due to the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. However, on the basis of previously reported results from SARS-CoV-1, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 assays may have significantly better clinical sensitivity than serology assays. To date, only a very small number of antigen-detecting LFAs have been developed. Development of a half-strip LFA is a useful first step in the development of any LFA format. In this work, we present a half-strip LFA using commercially available antibodies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested this LFA in buffer and measured an LOD of 0.65 ng/mL (95% CI of 0.53 to 0.77 ng/mL) ng/mL with recombinant antigen using an optical reader with sensitivity equivalent to a visual read. Further development, including evaluating the appropriate sample matrix, will be required for this assay approach to be made useful in a point of care setting, though this half-strip LFA may serve as a useful starting point for others developing similar tests.	false
0	Mechanical and Non-Mechanical Functions of Filamentous and Non-Filamentous Vimentin. Intermediate filaments (IFs) formed by vimentin are less understood than their cytoskeletal partners, microtubules and F-actin, but the unique physical properties of IFs, especially their resistance to large deformations, initially suggest a mechanical function. Indeed, vimentin IFs help regulate cell mechanics and contractility, and in crowded 3D environments they protect the nucleus during cell migration. Recently, a multitude of studies, often using genetic or proteomic screenings show that vimentin has many non-mechanical functions within and outside of cells. These include signaling roles in wound healing, lipogenesis, sterol processing, and various functions related to extracellular and cell surface vimentin. Extracellular vimentin is implicated in marking circulating tumor cells, promoting neural repair, and mediating the invasion of host cells by viruses, including SARS-CoV, or bacteria such asListeriaandStreptococcus. These findings underscore the fundamental role of vimentin in not only cell mechanics but also a range of physiological functions.	false
0	COVID-19 clinical manifestations and treatment strategies among solid-organ recipients: A systematic review of cases. Background: COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide with a significant death toll. Solid-organ transplantation (SOT) recipients are at higher risk due to their suppressed immune system. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review on COVID-19 clinical manifestations and treatment strategies in SOT recipients. Method(s): We searched three databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and transplantation. 50 studies, including 337 patients, were reviewed. Result(s): Two hundred thirty six patients were male, with a mean age of 49.9 years. The most prevalent group was the kidney 57.0%, followed by 17.2% heart and 13.6% liver. Fever and cough were the most reported clinical presentations. Infiltration (55.4%) in chest x-ray and ground-glass opacity (67.1%) in CT scans were the most radiological findings. It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with CRP level and lymphocytopenia, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels. The most common baseline immunosuppressants were calcineurin inhibitors (88.9%) and antimetabolites (73.2%). Antimetabolites (84.3%) and calcineurin inhibitors (54.3%) were discontinued/decreased 84.3% whereas glucocorticoids dosage almost has no change (77.9%) or even increased. 18.4% of cases had died, and 65.9% were discharged. Conclusion(s): Patients' demographics, signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings in SOT recipients are almost similar to the general population. However, gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be more common. There are different treatment strategies, but in most of them, antimetabolite and calcineurin inhibitors were decreased or discontinued, while corticosteroids were increased. Finally, COVID-19 seems to be more severe and has higher mortality in SOT recipients compared to the general population.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	"Echocardiographic characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. BACKGROUND: Myocardial involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be important for long-term prognosis. The aim of this observational study was to characterize the myocardial effects during SARS-CoV-2 infections by echocardiography., RESULTS AND METHODS: An extended echocardiographic image acquisition protocol was performed in 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessing LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential deformation including rotation, twist, and untwisting. Furthermore, LV deformation was analyzed in an age-matched control group of healthy individuals (n = 20). The most prevalent finding was a reduced longitudinal strain observed predominantly in more than one basal LV segment (n = 10/14 patients, 71%). This pattern reminded of a ""reverse tako-tsubo"" morphology that is not typical for other viral myocarditis. Additional findings included a biphasic pattern with maximum post-systolic or negative regional radial strain predominantly basal (n = 5/14 patients, 36%); the absence or dispersion of basal LV rotation (n = 6/14 patients, 43%); a reduced or positive regional circumferential strain in more than one segment (n = 7/14 patients, 50%); a net rotation showing late post-systolic twist or biphasic pattern (n = 8/14 patients, 57%); a net rotation showing polyphasic pattern and/or higher maximum net values during diastole (n = 8/14 patients, 57%)., CONCLUSION: Myocardial involvement due to SARS-CoV-2-infection was highly prevalent in the present cohort-even in patients with mild symptoms. It appears to be characterized by specific speckle tracking deformation abnormalities in the basal LV segments. These data set the stage to prospectively test whether these parameters are helpful for risk stratification and for the long-term follow-up of these patients."	false
0	Treatment of COVID-19 with convalescent plasma: lessons from past coronavirus outbreaks. BACKGROUND: There is currently no treatment known to alter the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Convalescent plasma has been used to treat a number of infections during pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and now severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)., OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing literature and registered clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for treating coronaviruses, and discuss issues of feasibility, and donor and patient selection., SOURCES: A review of articles published in PubMed was performed on 13 July 2020 to summarize the currently available evidence in human studies for convalescent plasma as a treatment for coronaviruses. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to summarize the currently registered randomized clinical trials for convalescent plasma in COVID-19., CONTENT: There were sixteen COVID-19, four MERS and five SARS reports describing convalescent plasma use in humans. There were two randomized control trials, both of which were for COVID-19 and were terminated early. Most COVID-19 reports described a potential benefit of convalescent plasma on clinical outcomes in severe or critically ill patients with few immediate adverse events. However, there were a number of limitations, including the concurrent use of antivirals, steroids and other treatments, small sample sizes, lack of randomization or control groups, and short follow-up time. Data from SARS and COVID-19 suggest that earlier administration probably yields better outcomes. The ideal candidates for recipients and donors are not known. Still, experience with previous coronaviruses tells us that antibodies in convalescent patients are probably short-lived. Patients who had more severe disease and who are earlier in their course of recovery may be more likely to have adequate titres. Finally, a number of practical challenges were identified., IMPLICATIONS: There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19, and preliminary trials for convalescent plasma suggest that there may be some benefits. However, research to date is at high risk of bias, and randomized control trials are desperately needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option.

0	Multi-platform Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assays for the Detection of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus that is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Acute infections should be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests, but serology tests can demonstrate previous exposure to the virus., METHODS: We compared the performance of the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays using 179 negative subjects to determine negative percent agreement (NPA) and in 60 SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed positive patients to determine positive percent agreement (PPA) at three different timeframes following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result., RESULTS: At >= 15 days, the PPA (95% CI) was 100 (86.3-100)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 96.0 (79.7-99.9)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 100 (86.3-100)% for the Abbott IgG assay. The NPA (95% CI) was 98.3 (95.2-99.7)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 99.4 (96.9-100)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 98.9 (96.0-99.9)% for the Abbott IgG assay. When the Roche total Ig assay was combined with either the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel or the Abbott IgG assay, the positive predictive value was 100% while the negative predictive value remained greater than 99%., CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays have similar clinical performance. We demonstrated a low false positive rate across all three platforms and observed that false positives observed on the Roche platform are unique compared to those observed on the Diazyme or Abbott assays. Using multiple platforms in tandem increases the PPVs which is important when screening populations with low disease prevalence. Copyright © 2020 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.	false

0	Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19: Prevalences, Recovery Rates, and Clinical Associations on a Large Brazilian Sample. Objective. Our study aimed to measure the percentage of reported olfactory or taste losses and their severity, recovery time, and association with other features in a large cohort of patients with COVID-19. Study Design. Prospective survey. Setting. Quaternary medical center and online survey. Methods. The perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities. Results. The prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality-specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively. The majority reported anosmia (42.9%). The presence of chemosensory symptoms was not associated with COVID-19 severity. At a median time >2 months after the onset of symptoms, rates of total and partial olfaction recovery were 53.8% and 44.7%, while complete or partial return to previous taste function was 68.3% and 27.6%. Less than 5% of the patients reported no chemosensory function improvement at all. Conclusion. The prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction is high among patients with COVID-19. Almost all patients seem to recover a significant part of their smell and taste abilities in the first 4 months after the onset of symptoms.	false
0	Case Series of Headache Characteristics in COVID-19: Headache Can Be an Isolated Symptom. Headache was reported in up to one-third of the hospitalized patients; yet, the clinical characteristics of headache associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been defined. This observational case study included patients who were consulted to headache unit due to headache and had COVID-19 illness. Headache features in 13 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were reported. Headache was the isolated symptom of the COVID-19 in 3 patients and emerged as an early symptom during the disease course in all patients. Patients specified severe, rapid onset, unrelenting headache with migraine-like features, as well as unusual sensory symptoms such as anosmia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and loss of appetite and weight. Headache lasted up to 3 days in 70% of the patients and resolved in all patients within 2 weeks. Despite the fact that most of the patients were female and headache characteristics were suggestive of migraine, majority of patients were not suffering from primary headaches. It was concluded that headache could be an isolated symptom of COVID-19, which might possibly be ignored in asymptomatic patients. Headaches associated with COVID-19 included features resembling migraine and/or atypical symptoms including anosmia and diarrhea. Copyright © 2020 American Headache Society.	false
0	COVID-19 and comorbidities: Deleterious impact on infected patients. The pandemic situation with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from China has endangered human lives. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is presented with asymptomatic, mild, or severe pneumonia-like symptoms. COVID-19 patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), hypertension, malignancies, HIV, and other comorbidities could develop a life-threatening situation. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE-2 receptors found at the surface of the host cells to get inside the cell. Certain comorbidities are associated with a strong ACE-2 receptor expression and higher release of proprotein convertase that enhances the viral entry into the host cells. The comorbidities lead to the COVID-19 patient into a vicious infectious circle of life and are substantially associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The comorbid individuals must adopt the vigilant preventive measure and require scrupulous management. In this review, we rigorously focused on the impact of common morbidities in COVID-19 patients and recapitulated the management strategies with recent directions. We found limited resources describing the association of comorbidities in COVID-19; however, our review delineates the broader spectrum of comorbidities with COVID-19 patients.

0	Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection Impairs Dendritic Cell and T Cell Responses. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections, yet the role of host immune responses in early COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 17 acute and 24 convalescent patients, we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in broad immune cell reduction including T, natural killer, monocyte, and dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were significantly reduced with functional impairment, and ratios of conventional DCs to plasmacytoid DCs were increased among acute severe patients. Besides lymphocytopenia, although neutralizing antibodies were rapidly and abundantly generated in patients, there were delayed receptor binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific T cell responses during the first 3 weeks after symptoms onset. Moreover, acute RBD- and NP-specific T cell responses included relatively more CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells. Our findings provided evidence that impaired DCs, together with timely inverted strong antibody but weak CD8 T cell responses, could contribute to acute COVID-19 pathogenesis and have implications for vaccine development.

0	Update on recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus infection pneumonia in Wuhan City, China, in late 2019, such cases have been gradually reported in other parts of China and abroad. Children have become susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of their immature immune function. As the outbreak has progressed, more cases of novel coronavirus infection/pneumonia in children have been reported. Compared with adults, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less severe, with a lower incidence and susceptibility in children, which results in fewer children being tested, thereby underestimating the actual number of infections. Therefore, strengthening the diagnosis of the disease is particularly important for children, and early and clear diagnosis can determine treatment strategies and reduce the harm caused by the disease to children. According to the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (trial version 7) issued by National Health Committee and the latest diagnosis and treatment strategies for novel coronavirus infection pneumonia in children, this review summarizes current strategies on diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.	false
0	Endothelial Dysfunction and Thrombosis in Patients With COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Alveolar-capillary endothelial cells can be activated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection leading to cytokine release. This could trigger endothelial dysfunction, pyroptosis, and thrombosis, which are the vascular changes, commonly referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) endotheliopathy. Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung samples of patients with COVID-19 and to compare them to pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 subtype 2009 and control cases. Approach and Results: Postmortem lung samples (COVID-19 group =6 cases; H1N1 group =10 cases, and control group =11 cases) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-IL (interleukin)-6, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha, anti-ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and anticaspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and suggested the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in the pulmonary samples. These conditions might lead to systemic thrombotic events that could impair the clinical staff's efforts to avoid fatal outcomes. One of the health professionals' goals should be to identify the high risk of thrombosis patients early to block endotheliopathy and its consequences.	false
0	Pre-existing cerebrovascular disease and poor outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients: a meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Due to pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states, COVID-19 infection is believed to increase the risk of stroke and worsen the outcomes of the patients having pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD). There is limited literature on prevalence of pre-existing CeVD in COVID-19 patients, and outcomes are unknown. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD., METHODS: English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to calculate OR along with its 95% CI from the studies containing data on composite poor outcome., RESULTS: Out of 8/11 studies showing data on mortality and mechanical ventilation, and 7/11 on ICU admission, pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.4% (244/4987). In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25-2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09-1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14-1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively. In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patient with pre-existing CeVD had 2.67-fold (1.75-4.06) higher odds of poor outcomes., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease have poor outcomes and extra precautions should be taken in managing such patients during the ongoing pandemic.	false

0	Antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein evaluated by 4 automated immunoassays and 3 ELISAs. OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein using 4 automated immunoassays and 3 ELISAs for the detection of total Ig antibodies (Roche) or IgG (Abbott, Diasorin, Snibe, Euroimmun, Mikrogen) in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020 including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection., RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% [95% confidence interval: 83.7-100] 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% [88.7-97.8] and 100% [96.1-100]. Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% [79.8-89.0] and 81.1% [76.6-85.7], p <0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the 2 IgG anti-N assays (Abbott and Euroimmun) than for the 2 IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin and Euroimmun) (>=50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12, and p <0.05 for % seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients., CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false

0	Mild Cytokine Elevation, Moderate CD4+ T Cell Response and Abundant Antibody Production in Children with COVID-19. Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported to show milder symptoms and better prognosis than their adult counterparts, but the difference of immune response against SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults hasn't been reported. Therefore we initiated this study to figure out the features of immune response in children with COVID-19. Sera and whole blood cells from 19 children with COVID-19 during different phases after disease onset were collected. The cytokine concentrations, SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or N-specific antibodies and T cell immune responses were detected respectively. In children with COVID-19, only 3 of 12 cytokines were increased in acute sera, including interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-16. We observed an increase in T helper (Th)-2 cells and a suppression in regulatory T cells (Treg) in patients during acute phase, but no significant response was found in the IFN-gamma-producing or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-producing CD8+ T cells in patients. S-RBD and N IgM showed an early induction, while S-RBD and N IgG were prominently induced later in convalescent phase. Potent S-RBD IgA response was observed but N IgA seemed to be inconspicuous. Children with COVID-19 displayed an immunophenotype that is less inflammatory than adults, including unremarkable cytokine elevation, moderate CD4+ T cell response and inactive CD8+ T cell response, but their humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were as strong as adults. Our finding presented immunological characteristics of children with COVID-19 and might give some clues as to why children develop less severe disease than adults.	false
0	Real-Time Digital Contact Tracing: Development of a System to Control COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in nursing homes and long-term care (LTC) facilities. Symptoms-based screening and manual contact tracing have limitations that render them ineffective for containing the viral spread in LTC facilities. Symptoms-based screening alone cannot identify asymptomatic people who are infected, and the viral spread is too fast in confined living quarters to be contained by slow manual contact tracing processes., OBJECTIVE: We describe the development of a digital contact tracing system that LTC facilities can use to rapidly identify and contain asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected contacts. A compartmental model was also developed to simulate disease transmission dynamics and to assess system performance versus conventional methods., METHODS: We developed a compartmental model parameterized specifically to assess the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission in LTC facilities. The model was used to quantify the impact of asymptomatic transmission and to assess the performance of several intervention groups to control outbreaks: no intervention, symptom mapping, polymerase chain reaction testing, and manual and digital contact tracing., RESULTS: Our digital contact tracing system allows users to rapidly identify and then isolate close contacts, store and track infection data in a respiratory line listing tool, and identify contaminated rooms. Our simulation results indicate that the speed and efficiency of digital contact tracing contributed to superior control performance, yielding up to 52% fewer cases than conventional methods., CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing systems show promise as an effective tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC facilities. As facilities prepare to relax restrictions and reopen to outside visitors, such tools will allow them to do so in a surgical, cost-effective manner that controls outbreaks while safely giving residents back the life they once had before this pandemic hit.

0	Human virus detection with graphene-based materials. Our recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of easy-to-use, quick, cheap, sensitive and selective detection of virus pathogens for the efficient monitoring and treatment of virus diseases. Early detection of viruses provides essential information about possible efficient and targeted treatments, prolongs the therapeutic window and hence reduces morbidity. Graphene is a lightweight, chemically stable and conductive material that can be successfully utilized for the detection of various virus strains. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be enhanced by its functionalization or combination with other materials. Introducing suitable functional groups and/or counterparts in the hybrid structure enables tuning of the optical and electrical properties, which is particularly attractive for rapid and easy-to-use virus detection. In this review, we cover all the different types of graphene-based sensors available for virus detection, including, e.g., photoluminescence and colorimetric sensors, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Various strategies of electrochemical detection of viruses based on, e.g., DNA hybridization or antigen-antibody interactions, are also discussed. We summarize the current state-of-the-art applications of graphene-based systems for sensing a variety of viruses, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, influenza, dengue fever, hepatitis C virus, HIV, rotavirus and Zika virus. General principles, mechanisms of action, advantages and drawbacks are presented to provide useful information for the further development and construction of advanced virus biosensors. We highlight that the unique and tunable physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials make them ideal candidates for engineering and miniaturization of biosensors.

Background: The rapid growth in cases of COVID-19 has challenged national healthcare capacity, testing systems at an advanced ICU, and public health infrastructure level. This global study evaluates the association between multi-factorial healthcare capacity and case fatality of COVID-19 patients by adjusting for demographic, health expenditure, population density, and prior burden of non-communicable disease. It also explores the impact of government relationships with civil society as a predictor of infection and mortality rates. Methods: Data were extracted from the Johns Hopkins University database, World Bank records and the National Civic Space Ratings 2020 database. This study used data from 86 countries which had at least 1,000 confirmed cases on 30th April 2020. Negative binomial regression model was used to assess the association between case fatality (a ratio of total number of confirmed deaths to total number of confirmed cases) and healthcare capacity index adjusting for other covariates. Findings: Regression analysis shows that greater healthcare capacity was related to lesser case-fatality [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.5811; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4727-0.7184; p < 0.001] with every additional unit increase in the healthcare capacity index associated with a 42% decrease in the case fatality. Health expenditure and civil society variables did not reach statistical significance but were positively associated with case fatalities. Interpretation: Based on preliminary data, this research suggests that building effective multidimensional healthcare capacity is the most promising means to mitigate future case fatalities. The data also suggests that government's ability to implement public health measures to a degree determines mortality outcomes. Copyright © 2020 Khan, Awan, Islam and Muurlink.	false

0	Universal screening of high-risk neonates, parents, and staff at a neonatal intensive care unit during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since February 21, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread exponentially worldwide. Neonatal patients needing intensive care are considered a vulnerable population. To report the results of a policy based on multi-timepoint surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 of all neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), their parents, and all healthcare providers in a part of Italy with a high prevalence of the infection. Observational study conducted from 21 February to 21 April 2020. Intervention consisted of (a) parental triage on arrival at the neonatal ward; (b) universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and blood testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; (c) use of continuous personal protective equipment at the NICU by parents and staff. A total of 6726 triage procedures were performed on 114 parents, and 954 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 226 individuals. Five (2.2%) asymptomatic individuals (2 parents and 3 healthcare providers) tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs and were kept isolated for 14 days. Of 75 admitted newborn, no one tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs or antibody tests. Three parents presented with fever or flu-like symptoms at triage; they tested negative on swabs. Conclusion: With universal screening of neonates, parents, and staff, there were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the neonates admitted to a NICU in an area with a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2. Our experience could be usefully compared with other strategies with a view to developing future evidence-based guidelines for managing high-risk neonates in case of new epidemics. What is Known: The novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has since spread worldwide at a remarkable rate, with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases. Pediatric population may be less affected from COVID-19 than adult population but infants and newborn babies seem to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. What is New: Using an approach based on triage; testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and serology; and use of personal protective equipment, there were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among neonates in a NICU in a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 area. Positive and asymptomatic individuals were identified and isolated early allowing the containment of infection's spread among healthcare providers and parents.	false
0	For-profit long-term care homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths. BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) homes have been the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada to date. Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19., RESULTS: The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership., INTERPRETATION: For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.

0	COVID-19 and Sleep in Medical Staff: Reflections, Clinical Evidences, and Perspectives. Purpose of the review: There is evidence that, before the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), healthcare workers did not experience good sleep quality with relevant consequences on health. By contrast, little is known about the sleep quality of medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we aimed to contribute with a review of the literature, sharing our clinical experience supported by actigraphic evaluation and by proposing future strategies. Recent findings: Sleep disorders, in particular insomnia, have been commonly reported in frontline medical workers, in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and are often accompanied by depressive and anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality, however, has been mainly assessed by the use of self-reported measures, thus limiting clinical usefulness. Summary: Poor sleep quality among the medical staff is prevalent, and our experience supports that this has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal investigation assessing whether and for how long sleep remains altered in medical staff could be of interest to evaluate the temporal effect of the pandemic on health.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Bacterial and fungal coinfection among hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study in a UK secondary-care setting. Objectives: To investigate the incidence of bacterial and fungal coinfection of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in this retrospective observational study across two London hospitals during the first UK wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. Result(s): A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low. Conclusion(s): We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases	false

0	Prevalence and Mortality of COVID-19 Patients With Gastrointestinal Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was performed from December 1, 2019 to May 7, 2020. Observational studies including adults with COVID-19 infection and reporting GI symptoms were included. The primary outcome was assessing the weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection. Secondary outcomes were WPP of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection with GI symptoms. Results: A total of 78 studies with 12,797 patients were included. Among GI symptoms (at onset of illness in 6, at admission in 17, data given separately for both in 3, and data unavailable in 52 studies), the WPP of diarrhea was 12.4% (95% CI, 8.2% to 17.1%), I-2=94%; nausea and/or vomiting, 9.0% (95% CI, 5.5% to 12.9%), I-2=93%; loss of appetite, 22.3% (95% CI, 11.2% to 34.6%, I-2=94%; and abdominal pain, 6.2% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%), I-2=92%. Mortality among patients with GI symptoms (0.4%; 95% CI, 0% to 1.1%; I-2=74%) was similar to overall mortality (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 4.7%; I-2=94%), P=.15. Most studies had high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in up to 1 in 5 patients with COVID-19 infection. More high-quality evidence is needed to confirm these findings and explore factors causing mortality in these patients. (C) 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research	false
0	How should our testing behaviour change with time in children in current COVID-19 pandemic?. Backgrounds: More paediatric-confirmed cases have been reported with the global pandemic of COVID-19. This study aims to summarize the key points and supply suggestions on screening paediatric COVID-19 patients more appropriately. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively included paediatric patients who have accepted SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (30 January 2020 to 13 February 2020) and compared them with paediatric-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Besides, a review was carried out by analysing all current literature about laboratory-confirmed paediatric cases with COVID-19. Result(s): There were 46 suspected cases included in the descriptive study. The results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were all negative. Compared with paediatric-confirmed cases, the incidence of epidemic history was lower in suspected cases (P <.001). The rate of fever (P <.001), cough (P <.001), headache or dizziness (P <.001), vomiting (P <.001) and abdominal discomfort or distention (P =.01) were more observed in the included suspected children. There were more children having decreased WBC count in the confirmed group. In the literature review, twenty-nine studies were obtained with 488 paediatric COVID-19 cases. 88.6% of them had epidemiological history. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms. Compared with older patients, the incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, lethargy and headache or dizziness was lower, while gastrointestinal symptoms were reported more. Conclusion(s): Children with a history of close contact with confirmed cases, manifested as cough and fever should be paid more attention to after excluding infection of other common pathogens. Atypical symptoms should not be over-emphasized in screening paediatric COVID-19. More studies are needed for guiding efficient recognition in paediatric COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

0	Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) Alliance Against COVID-19: One Step Forward. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the data of Department of Health in United Kingdom (UK) showed an increase mortality and morbidity among the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. This high mortality can be due to social factors, genetic and immunological factors. Metabolic factors like high prevalence of diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and hypertension were also found to contribute to the increased risk of COVID-19 infection in BAME population. In addition, a large number of BAME population are working in jobs that involve regular and daily contact with public, and this may increase risk of encountering COVID-19 infection. Therefore, future research should address all these factors and generate the correct health policy that will allow us to combat the danger of COVID-19. We recommend the establishment of BAME alliance against COVID-19 in order to improve occupational risks and hazards, adequate income protection, culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications and decreasing barriers in accessing healthcare. The BAME alliance will initially focus on (i) development of central system to record data about COVID-19 patients from BAME population (ii) involvement of healthcare professionals and researchers from ethnic minorities and (iii) multidisciplinary and inter-institution collaboration; for example, civil engineers and architects need to think about house design and ventilation that decrease risk of COVID-19 especially in BAME populations.	false
0	Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a guide for the dermatologist. The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. While new skin manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview of the cutaneous side effects associated with the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin +/- interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir and darunavir) and treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed. Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management and key points for differential diagnosis are presented.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Development and evaluation of a Novel RT-PCR system for reliable and rapid SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations. BACKGROUND: The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused great global concerns. In contrast to SARS, some SARS-CoV-2-infected people can be asymptomatic or have only mild nonspecific symptoms. Furthermore, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. With the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in plasma or serum, blood safety is worthy of consideration., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a nucleic acid test (NAT) screening system for SARS-CoV-2 targeting nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF 1ab) gene that could screen 5076 samples every 24 hours. The 2019 novel coronavirus RNA standard was used to evaluate linearity of standard curves. Diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated using artificial SARS-CoV-2. Specificity was evaluated with 61 other respiratory pathogens. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing two sputum and nine oropharyngeal swab specimens. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood donor specimens collected during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Chengdu., RESULTS: Limits of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for N and ORF 1ab gene were 12.5 and 27.58 copies/mL, respectively. Intra-assay and interassay for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay based on cycle threshold were acceptably low. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory virus and bacterial isolates. The overall agreement value between the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and clinical diagnostic results was 100%. A total of 16 287 blood specimens collected from blood donors during SARS-CoV-2 surveillance were tested negative., CONCLUSIONS: A high-throughput NAT screening system was developed for SARS-CoV-2 screening of blood donations during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

0	Optimized pseudotyping conditions for the SARS COV-2 Spike glycoprotein. The SARS COV-2 Spike glycoprotein is solely responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The ability to generate viral particles pseudotyped with SARS COV-2 Spike is useful for many types of studies, such as characterization of neutralizing antibodies or development of fusion-inhibiting small molecules. Here we characterized the use of a codon-optimized SARS COV-2 Spike glycoprotein for the generation of pseudotyped HIV-1, MLV, and VSV particles. The full-length Spike protein functioned inefficiently with all three systems but was enhanced over 10-fold by deleting the last 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of Spike. Infection of 293FT target cells was only possible if the cells were engineered to stably express the human ACE-2 receptor, but stably introducing an additional copy of this receptor did not further enhance susceptibility. Stable introduction of the Spike activating protease TMPRSS2 further enhanced susceptibility to infection by 5-10 fold. Substitution of the signal peptide of the Spike protein with an optimal signal peptide did not enhance or reduce infectious particle production. However, modifications D614G and R682Q further enhanced infectious particle production. With all enhancing elements combined, the titer of pseudotyped HIV-1 particles reached almost 106 infectious particles/ml. Finally, HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS COV-2 Spike was successfully used to detect neutralizing antibodies in plasma from COVID-19 patients, but not plasma from uninfected individuals.IMPORTANCE When working with pathogenic viruses, it is useful to have rapid quantitative tests for viral infectivity that can be performed without strict biocontainment restrictions. A common way of accomplishing this is to generate viral pseudoparticles that contain the surface glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus incorporated into a replication-defective viral particle that contains a sensitive reporter system. These pseudoparticles enter cells using the glycoprotein from the pathogenic virus leading to a readout for infection. Conditions that block entry of the pathogenic virus, such as neutralizing antibodies, will also block entry of the viral pseudoparticles. However, viral glycoproteins often are not readily suited for generating pseudoparticles. Here we describe a series of modifications that result in the production of relatively high titer SARS COV-2 pseudoparticles that are suitable for detection of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.	false
0	Is the host viral response and the immunogenicity of vaccines altered in pregnancy?. The intricacy of the maternal immune system arises from its ability to prevent a maternal immune response against a semi-allogenic fetus, while protecting the mother against harmful pathogens. However, these immunological adaptations may also make pregnant women vulnerable to developing adverse complications from respiratory viral infections. While the influenza and SARS pandemics support this theory, there is less certainty regarding the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine development is key to public preventative strategies. Whilst most viral vaccines are able to induce a seroprotective antibody response, in some high-risk individuals this may not correlate with clinical protection. Some studies have shown that factors such as age, gender, and chronic illnesses can reduce their effectiveness and in this review, we discuss how pregnancy may affect the efficacy and immunogenicity of vaccines. We present literature to support the hypothesis that pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory viral infections and may not respond to vaccines as effectively. In particular, we focus on the clinical implications of important respiratory viral infections such as influenza during pregnancy, and the pregnancy induced alterations in important leukocytes such as TFH, cTFH and B cells, which play an important role in generating long-lasting and high-affinity antibodies. Finally, we review how this may affect the efficacy of vaccines against influenza in pregnancy and highlight areas that require further research.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	Health psychology and coronavirus pandemic crisis (COVID-19): A review study. Background: In addition to physical effects, the prevalence of COVID-19 has serious psychological consequences. The aim of this study was to provide a brief overview of the psychological consequences of the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 disease, and the strategies of health psychology in dealing with this crisis. Method(s): In this review study that was done in March 2020, indexed articles on psychology and corona were used at the ProQuest, Pubmed, Scientific Information Database (SID), Ovid, Iranmedex, Science direct, Springer, google scholar, Scopus database. Finding(s): It was determined by reviewing reliable sources that psychological consequences of COVID-19 disease were different among health stuff, general population, infected patients, their families, and children, separately. Conclusion(s): From the perspective of health psychology, care strategies for different spectrums of individuals and ultimately reducing the effects of quarantine have been proposed. Furthermore, psychoneuroimmunological research evidence of the effects of stress and negative psychological consequences on immune function and greater vulnerability to coronavirus has also been discussed.Copyright © 2016 Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

0	Diagnostic serial interval as a novel indicator for contact tracing effectiveness exemplified with the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. BACKGROUND: The clinical onset serial interval is often used as a proxy for the transmission interval of an infectious disease. For SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers., METHODS: We define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. Based on the DS4C project data on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea, we estimate the means of the diagnostic serial interval, the clinical onset serial interval, and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals., RESULTS: The mean of the diagnostic serial interval was estimated to be 3.63 days (95% CI: 3.24, 4.01). The diagnostic serial interval was significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.12 days, 95% CI: -1.98, -0.26)., CONCLUSIONS: The relatively short diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea are likely due to the country's extensive efforts towards contact tracing. We propose the mean diagnostic serial interval as a new indicator for the effectiveness of a country's contact tracing as part of the epidemic surveillance. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Anatomical and timely assessment of protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, SARS-CoV-2 specific receptor, in fetal and placental tissues: new insight for perinatal counseling. Infection with SARS-CoV2 does not spare pregnant women and the possibility of vertical transmission which might lead to fetal damages is pending., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation., METHODS: Discovery study. Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. Five cases of medical termination of pregnancy performed at between 15 and 38 weeks' in healthy women. Paraffin-embedded tissues (kidneys, brain, lungs, intestinal tract, heart). Matching tissues from 8-year-old children (N=4) were tested as controls. Seven placentas including those of the 5 cases, 1 of a 7-week miscarriage and 1 of a symptomatic SARS-COV2 pregnancy at 34 weeks. Tissues' sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry., RESULTS: ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. It was barely detectable in lungs at 15 weeks' and not found thereafter. In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks' onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother's SARS-CoV2 placenta., CONCLUSIONS: Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation. Clinical follow-up of infected pregnant women and their children are needed to validate these observations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

0	Role of Immune Dysregulation in Increased Mortality Among a Specific Subset of COVID-19 Patients and Immune-Enhancement Strategies for Combatting Through Nutritional Supplements. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing varying severities of illness. Some are asymptomatic and some develop severe disease leading to mortality across ages. This contrast triggered us explore the causes, with the background that a vaccine for effective immunization or a drug to tackle COVID-19 is not too close to reality. We have discussed strategies to combat COVID-19 through immune enhancement, using simple measures including nutritional supplements. Discussion: A literature search on mortality-related comorbid conditions was performed. For those conditions, we analyzed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could cause the draining of the immune reservoir. We also analyzed the immune markers necessary for the defense mechanism/immune surveillance against COVID-19, especially through simple means including immune enhancing nutritional supplement consumption, and we suggest strategies to combat COVID-19. Major comorbid conditions associated with increased mortality include cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, being immunocompromised by cancer, and severe kidney disease with a senile immune system. Consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans strain (AFO-202) beta 1,3-1,6 glucan supported enhanced IL-8, sFAS macrophage activity, and NK cells' cytotoxicity, which are major defense mechanisms against viral infection. Conclusion:  People with co-morbid conditions who are more prone to COVID-19-related deaths due to immune dysregulation are likely to benefit from consuming nutritional supplements that enhance the immune system. We recommend clinical studies to validate AFO-202 beta glucan in COVID-19 patients to prove its efficacy in overcoming a hyper-inflammation status, thus reducing the mortality, until a definite vaccine is made available.

0	Diagnosis of COVID-19 using multiple antibody assays in two cases with negative PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs. We report of two cases of progressed COVID-19 with negative PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, in whom diagnosis was made by different antibody assays, including a lateral flow rapid test and multiple commercial ELISAs, finally confirmed by comprehensive serological assays. These cases highlight that commercial ELISAs and even rapid tests might significantly aid the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly, if a combination of serological assays is used with a specific clinical question, in severely ill patients after seroconversion and when comprehensive serological methods are used for confirmation.	false
0	Viral Load Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Saliva in Korean Patients: a Prospective Multi-center Comparative Study. Background: This study was performed to compare the viral load and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva with those in standard nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs. Methods: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from four hospitals were prospectively enrolled and matched samples of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected at Day 1 of admission and every other day till consequently negative for two times. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to detect the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes. Results: The cycle threshold values of saliva were comparable to those of NP/OP swabs overall (P= 0.720, Mann-Whitney U test). However, the overall sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was 64% (34/53), which is lower than the 77% (41/53) using NP/OP swabs. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was especially lower in early stage of symptom onset (1-5 days; 8/15; 53%) and in patients who did not have sputum (12/22; 55%). Conclusion: Saliva sample itself is not appropriate for initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to replace NP/OP swabs, especially for the person who does not produce sputum. COVID-19 cannot be excluded when the test using saliva is negative, and it is necessary to retest using NP/OP swabs.	false

0	COVID-19 - Recent advancements in identifying novel vaccine candidates and current status of upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly. To date, countries have relied on the prevention of the disease through isolation, quarantine, and clinical care of affected individuals. However, studies on the roles of asymptomatic and mildly infected subjects in disease transmission, use of antiviral drugs, and vaccination of the general population will be very important for mitigating the effects of the eventual return of this pandemic. Initial investigations are ongoing to evaluate antigenic structures of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. There also is a need to comprehensively compile the details of previous studies on SARS-related vaccines that can be extrapolated to identify potent vaccine targets for developing COVID-19 vaccines. This review aims to analyze previous studies, current status, and future possibilities for producing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Copyright © 2020, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	false
0	nCOVID-19 Pandemic: From Molecular Pathogenesis to Potential Investigational Therapeutics. In December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related epidemic was first observed in Wuhan, China. In 2020, owing to the highly infectious and deadly nature of the virus, this widespread novel coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic. Studies have revealed that various environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and air pollution may also affect the transmission pattern of COVID-19. Unfortunately, still, there is no specific drug that has been validated in large-scale studies to treat patients with confirmed nCOVID-19. However, remdesivir, an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), has appeared as an auspicious antiviral drug. Currently, a large-scale study on remdesivir (i.e., 200 mg on first day, then 100 mg once/day) is ongoing to evaluate its clinical efficacy to treat nCOVID-19. Good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was not observed with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Nonetheless, the combination of umifenovir and LPV/r was found to have better antiviral activity. Furthermore, a combination of hydroxychloroquine (i.e., 200 mg 3 times/day) and azithromycin (i.e., 500 mg on first day, then 250 mg/day from day 2-5) also exhibited good activity. Currently, there are also ongoing studies to evaluate the efficacy of teicoplanin and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, in this article, we have analyzed the genetic diversity and molecular pathogenesis of nCOVID-19. We also present possible therapeutic options for nCOVID-19 patients.© Copyright © 2020 Kabir, Uddin, Hossain, Abdulhakim, Alam, Ashraf, Bungau, Bin-Jumah, Abdel-Daim and Aleya.	false
0	Multivariate Analysis of Black Race and Environmental Temperature on COVID-19 in the US. BACKGROUND: There has been much interest in environmental temperature and race as modulators of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection and mortality. However, in the United States race and temperature correlate with various other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and environmental influences that could be responsible for noted effects. This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties., METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature., RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models. Black race was an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, many proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19, such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity.

0	Characteristics and roles of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific antibodies in patients with different severities of coronavirus 19. The diagnosis of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) relies mainly upon viral nucleic acid detection, but false negatives can lead to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody detection is convenient, safe and highly sensitive. Immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG are commonly used to serologically diagnose COVID-19; however, the role of IgA is not well known. We aimed to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, identify changes in them based on COVID-19 severity, and establish the significance of combined antibody detection. COVID-19 patients, divided into a severe and critical group and a moderate group, and non-COVID-19 patients with respiratory disease were included in this study. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG in the blood samples from the three groups. Epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, blood test results and other data were recorded for all patients. Compared to the traditional IgM-IgG combined antibodies, IgA-IgG combined antibodies are more effective for diagnosing COVID-19. During the disease process, IgA appeared first and disappeared last. All three antibodies had significantly higher levels in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients. IgA and IgG were also higher for severe and critical disease than for moderate disease. All antibodies were at or near low levels at the time of tracheal extubation in critical patients. Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific combined IgA-IgG antibodies is advantageous in diagnosing COVID-19. IgA detection is suitable during early and late stages of the disease. IgA and IgG levels correspond to disease severity. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Epidemiology, genomic structure, the molecular mechanism of injury, diagnosis and clinical manifestations of coronavirus infection: An overview. COVID-19 is caused by a novel beta coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) strain that was first discovered in 2019 in the Wuhan city of China. Based on virus genome sequencing studies, the bat is suspected as the natural host of virus, and infection might be transmitted from bats via unknown intermediate hosts like reptiles and snakes etc., to infect humans. COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person contact, primarily via droplet infection within the incubation period or after clinical manifestations of fever, cough, sneezing, sputum, dyspnea, and pneumonia and through contaminated fomites. COVID-19 enters the respiratory tract through the ACE2 receptor on alveoli through binding of s-protein of the virus and causes injuries though the cytopathic effect, as well as cytokines and other mediators, released after developing sepsis. ACE 2 is almost 100-fold higher in kidneys than lung, and the virus can also involve the kidney in the same manner. Kidney involvement manifests in the form of proteinuria, hematuria, and an acute rise in serum creatinine. Kidney involvement is an independent risk factor for mortality. Diagnosis is primarly made by detecting viral RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Role of antibodies, both IgM and IgG are still evolving and at best restricted for epidemiological purpose. Though a large number of treatments, including hydroxychloroquine, anti-viral, convalescent plasma etc., are being tried, as of now treatment is symptomatic only.Copyright © 2020 Indian Journal of Nephrology  Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.	false
0	COVID 19 and acute kidney injury. Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), a beta coronavirus, mainly involves the respiratory tract, and the clinical features simulate to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) of the past. The genome of the SARS-CoV-2, isolated from a cluster-patient with a typical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan, had 89% nucleotide identitical with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. It enters the respiratory tract through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors on alveoli. It may induce lung injury through direct cytopathic effect, involving effector T cells or causing sepsis and inducing cytokine storm.With a similar mechanism, it can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). The overall incidence of AKI is 5.1%, and AKI is an independent risk factor for mortality. The hazard ratio of death increases with the increasing severity of AKI. Management of COVID-19 with AKI is primarily supportive care, and at present, there are no evidence based effective antivirals for the treatment.Copyright © 2020 Indian Journal of Nephrology  Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.	false

0	Ascorbate as Prophylaxis and Therapy for COVID-19-Update From Shanghai and U.S. Medical Institutions. Background: No validated treatments have been identified for the COVID-19 pandemic virus; several are currently in randomized clinical trials. Diagnostic instruments are rapidly evolving. Symptoms range from those of a common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to sepsis arising from the flood of inflammatory bacterial and viral pathogens in the blood. Mortality generally arises from cytokine storms of uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, with secondary bacterial infection. To address the indisputably urgent need for therapeutics for COVID-19, a specialized interdisciplinary medical panel convened in Shanghai in March 2020 to consider all relevant clinical and experimental evidence on the possible utility of intravenous (IV) ascorbate in the treatment of COVID-19-related ARDS., Methods: The panel convened multidisciplinary medical experts and reviewed all relevant in vitro, in vivo, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials on IV ascorbate and issued a consensus report on 23 March 2020 noting that substantial differences in serum concentrations of ascorbate are achieved through IV administration in contrast with the oral route., Findings: The Shanghai panel, and a parallel medical group in Guangzhou, are advising the use of high-dose IV ascorbate for the treatment of ARDS, along with other supportive therapies, including Vitamin D and zinc. We report preliminary progress in using this treatment for 50 consecutive cases treated in Shanghai hospitals, consistent with earlier reports from a meta-analysis of the use of IV ascorbate to treat sepsis. We provide an instructive clinical anecdote regarding a single family where one elderly member with cardiac and other major comorbidities developed and survived ARDS-related sepsis following daily treatments that included 15 g of IV ascorbate. None of her adult caregivers who had ingested between 2 and 10 g of ascorbate daily developed COVID-19. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in different biologic matrix, their diagnostic validity and clinical relevance: A systematic review. Due to COVID 19 outbreak many studies are being conducted for therapeutic strategies and vaccines but detection methods play an important role in the containment of the disease. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the molecular detection techniques in COVID-19. For framing the systematic review 6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies and articles were screened for relevant content till 25th April 2020. Observations from this systematic review reveal the utility of RT-PCR with serological testing as one such method cannot correlate with accurate results. Availability of point of care devices do not conform to sensitivity and specificity in comparison to the conventional methods due to lack of clinical investigations. Pivotal aim of molecular and serological research is the development of detection methods that can support the clinical decision making of patients suspected with SARS-CoV-2. However, none of the methods were 100% sensitive and specific; hence additional studies are required to overcome the challenges addressed here. We hope that the present article with its observations and suggestions will assist the researchers to realize this vision in future. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and its mitigation strategies for the development of vaccines and immunotherapies to counter COVID-19. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global threat and death tolls are increasing worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 though shares similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, immunopathology of the novel virus is not understood properly. Previous reports from SARS and MERS-CoV documents that preexisting, non-neutralizing or poorly neutralizing antibodies developed as a result of vaccine or infection enhance subsequent infection, a phenomenon called as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Since immunotherapy has been implicated for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine is under development, due consideration has to be provided on ADE to prevent untoward reactions. ADE mitigation strategies like the development of vaccine or immunotherapeutics targeting receptor binding motif can be designed to minimize ADE of SARS-CoV-2 since full-length protein-based approach can lead to ADE as reported in MERS-CoV. The present mini-review aims to address the phenomenon of ADE of SARS-CoV-2 through the lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and ways to mitigate them so as to develop better vaccines and immunotherapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.	false
0	Climate and COVID-19 pandemic: effect of heat and humidity on the incidence and mortality in world's top ten hottest and top ten coldest countries. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global public health crisis with social, psychological and long-lasting economical damages. Weather-related dynamics have an impact on the pattern of human health and disease. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in ten of the world's hottest countries compared to ten of the coldest ones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worldwide, we selected 20 countries; 10 hottest countries with the highest temperatures and 10 coldest countries with the lowest temperature. The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.31 +/- 1.51) and humidity (44.67 +/- 4.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.19 1.61) and humidity (57.26 +/- 2.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web “Time and Date”. RESULTS: In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.12 +/- 24.33); cumulative cases (9094.341 +/- 708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.84 43.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72 +/- 207.37); cumulative cases (44232.381 +/- 5875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29 +/- 310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (beta= -5.40, p<0.001) and (beta = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1 degrees C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (beta = -1.35. p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed a significant decrease in incidence of daily cases and deaths in countries with high temperatures and low humidity (warmest countries), compared to those countries with low temperatures and high humidity (coldest countries). The findings could be of interest to the policymakers and the health officials on the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic and weather changes.	false
0	Hepatitis A susceptibility parallels high COVID-19 mortality. The COVID-19 has become the biggest health problem of our century. We hypothesized that immunity against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) may provide protection from COVID- 19. As of June 10, 2020, the infection had spread to 213 countries, with 7.3 million people infected and 413,733 dead . We combined this data with the WHO's susceptibility classification on the prevalence of HAV in the world. We found a significant relationship between Covid 19 mortality and HAV susceptibility (p<0.001). If confirmed, the consequences of this simple discovery will be enormous.	false

Utilising biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prediction of treatment response and overall prognostication have been investigated recently. However, these ventures have only considered the use of blood-based molecular markers. Saliva is another biofluid that warrants being applied in similar fashion with major advantages that centres on its non-invasive and repeatable collection as well as cost-efficiency. To this end, this article presents a hypothesis for the sources of biomarkers useful clinically for COVID-19 disease outcome estimation and identify the likely implications of their detection in saliva.

0	"Closing the COVID-19 Psychological Treatment Gap for Cancer Patients in Alberta: Protocol for the Implementation and Evaluation of Text4Hope-Cancer Care. BACKGROUND: Cancer diagnoses and treatments usually engender significant anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients, close relatives, and caregivers. Providing psychological support during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. As demonstrated in previous research, this evidence-based program supports good outcomes and high user satisfaction., OBJECTIVE: We will implement daily supportive text messaging as a way of reducing and managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta, Canada. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care-induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated., METHODS: Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and the close relatives of those dealing with a cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting ""CancerCare"" to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset from individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid- and endpoints of the program (ie, at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively). Data will be analyzed with parametric and nonparametric statistics for primary outcomes (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and usage metrics, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining subscriber characteristics that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program., RESULTS: The first research stage, which was completed in April 2020, involved the creation and review of the supportive text messages and uploading of messages into a web-based text messaging service. The second stage, involving the launch of the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program, occurred in May 2020., CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for health care practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/20240.

0	Long-term effects of COVID-19 in a patient on maintenance dialysis. Coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory infection highly associated with severe complications in elderly subjects affected by cardiovascular disease. Patients on maintenance dialysis are exceptionally vulnerable because most of them are old and have multiple comorbidities. We report the complex clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient on maintenance dialysis who presented with fever and lung edema. After 41 days from the primary infection, the clinically recovered patient experienced symptomatic reactivation of SARS-COV-2 infection documented by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result on nasal/oropharyngeal swab with immunoglobulin M seroconversion. The recurrence of PCR positivity forced us to perform hemodialysis in a separate isolation room for a prolonged period of time. Close monitoring of previously infected patients and restructuring of dialysis facilities are necessary to avoid new outbreaks of this concerning disease.

0	Cryopreservation in reproductive medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: rethinking policies and European safety regulations. Cryopreservation of reproductive cells and tissues represents an essential aspect of ART practices that might be particularly strategic and helpful during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. However, recommendations on how and when to preserve reproductive tissues and cells during a novel severe pandemic are scanty. This paper uses a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to identify favorable and unfavorable factors and to recognize challenges and obstacles related to the use of cryopreservation procedures during the spreading of a new virus. One of the strengths associated with the cryopreservation is represented by the availability of robust European guidelines on storage safety to prevent sample contamination or cross-contamination by pathogens. These recommendations should be deep-rooted in all ART laboratories. Weaknesses include uncertainties regarding the management of COVID-19 affected asymptomatic patients, the suboptimal accuracy of diagnostic tests for the disease, the nebulous prospective regarding the duration of the pandemic and the additional costs. The application of the strategy represents an opportunity to postpone pregnancy in order to avoid a severe infectious disease during gestation while concomitantly counteracting the possible detrimental effect of time. Critical threats, at present still undefined, are represented by potential adverse events for the mother and offspring due to infected gametes or embryos after thawing and, subsequently, the re-spreading of the virus.

We describe a man whose first manifestations of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurred in tandem with symptomatic onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Drawing from recent data on prion disease pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that the cascade of systemic inflammatory mediators in response to the virus accelerated the pathogenesis of our patient's prion disease. This hypothesis introduces the potential relationship between immune responses to the novel coronavirus and the hastening of preclinical or manifest neurodegenerative disorders. The global prevalence of both COVID-19 and neurodegenerative disorders adds urgency to the study of this potential relationship.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Anti-Neutrophilic Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) Vasculitis Presented as Pulmonary Hemorrhage in a Positive COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a small vessel vasculitis with a wide spectrum of presentation, ranging from limited disease to life-threatening situation such as alveolar hemorrhage. Immunosuppression is the corner stone of the treatment and if left untreated, the death toll increases dramatically. We presented a case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, presented with alveolar hemorrhage associated with COVID-19 infection. The patient admitted to the intensive care unit, received pulse steroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin. She was not given further immunosuppression because of the coexisting COVID-19. Up to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to granulomatosis with polyangiitis coexisting with COVID-19 infection.	false

0	An infant with coronavirus disease 2019 in China: A case report. RATIONALE: In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19., PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother., DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay., INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon alpha-2b and supportive therapy., OUTCOMES: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020., LESSONS: Strengthening infants' virus screening in families with infected kins is important for early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment when symptoms are atypical. The infectivity of infants with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 should not be ignored because this may be a source of transmission in the community.	false
0	Administration of Immunoglobulins in SARS-CoV-2-Positive Patient Is Associated With Fast Clinical and Radiological Healing: Case Report. Polyclonal preparation of IgM as an adjuvant therapy has been reported as a relevant immunomodulant therapy in several infectious diseases, exhibiting, in most cases, improvement of the clinical course. No drug has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy for COVID-19. Immunomodulatory treatment with hydroxychloroquine and biologics as tocilizumab, in fact, has not proven to show satisfactory results in several reports. We therefore treated a selected patient with interstitial multifocal pneumonia, positive to COVID-19, with polyclonal preparation of immunoglobulins as an adjuvant therapy, obtaining in few days clinical remission and improvements in radiological findings. Based on this case report, we suggest that clinical trials are conducted to test the efficacy and safety of polyclonal immunoglobulins for adjunctive therapy of COVID-19.	false
0	A simple correction for covid-19 testing bias. COVID-19 testing studies have become a standard approach for estimating prevalence and fatality rates which then assist in public health decision making to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease. The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high) and over-estimation of fatality rates. Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. We show via an example that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error.	false
0	A novel biparatopic hybrid antibody-ACE2 fusion that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for therapy. In the absence of a proven effective vaccine preventing infection by SARS-CoV-2, or a proven drug to treat COVID-19, the positive results of passive immune therapy using convalescent serum provide a strong lead. We have developed a new class of tetravalent, biparatopic therapy, 89C8-ACE2. It combines the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (89C8) that recognizes the relatively conserved N-terminal domain of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein, and the ectodomain of ACE2, which binds to the receptor-binding domain of S. This molecule shows exceptional performancein vitro, inhibiting the interaction of recombinant S1 to ACE2 and transduction of ACE2-overexpressing cells by S-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50s substantially below 100 pM, and with potency approximately 100-fold greater than ACE2-Fc itself. Moreover, 89C8-ACE2 was able to neutralize authentic viral infection in a standard 96-h co-incubation assay at low nanomolar concentrations, making this class of molecule a promising lead for therapeutic applications.	false
0	COVID-19 in patients with heart failure: the new and the old epidemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread in nearly 200 countries in less than 4 months since its first identification; accordingly, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 2019) has affirmed itself as a clinical challenge. The prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases in patients with COVID19 is high and this dreadful combination dictates poor prognosis along with the higher risk of intensive care mortality. In the setting of chronic heart failure, SARS-CoV-2 can be responsible for myocardial injury and acute decompensation through various mechanisms. Given the clinical and epidemiological complexity of COVID-19, patiens with heart failure may require particular care since the viral infection has been identified, considering an adequate re-evaluation of medical therapy and a careful monitoring during ventilation.

0	The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein increases infectivity in an ACE2 receptor dependent manner. The SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic has been reported to have a relatively low mutation rate. Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.	false
0	Management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia: A summary of 41 confirmed cases reported worldwide. There is no consensus on immunosuppression management for kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Therefore, we conducted a search in English database from October 2019 to July 2020 and extracted data from cases with treatment details worldwide, and total of 41 recipients with a median age of 50 years were enrolled in this study. Most of them were males (75.8%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (80.5%), cough (63.4%), and fatigue (41.5%). Patients were classified into three catalogs according to severity of pneumonia: 17 (41.5%) were mild, 15 (36.6%) severe, and 9 (21.9%) critical disease. Laboratory tests revealed that serum creatinine of critical patients was significantly higher than that of mild or severe patients. 68.3% received oxygen support; all patients received antiviral therapy, and 15 (36.6%) recipients were additionally treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon-alpha. 19.5% of patients maintained immunosuppressive therapy; 36.6% suspended antimetabolite; and 43.9% only treated with corticosteroid. Six (14.6%) patients died (severe: 2, critical: 4); high creatinine with low lymphocyte count was the biggest challenge of immunosuppression management. In all, it is necessary to pay close attention to renal function and lymphocyte count in KTRs infected with COVID-19 and choose appropriate medication programs according to the specific situations.

0	Structural and functional properties of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: potential antivirus drug development for COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 is a newly emerging infectious disease currently spreading across the world. It is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion by forming a six-helical bundle via the two-heptad repeat domain. In this review, we highlight recent research advance in the structure, function and development of antivirus drugs targeting the S protein.	false
0	Incidence and mortality risk in coronavirus disease 2019 patients complicated by acute cardiac injury: systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The prevalence and prognostic implications of acute cardiac injury (ACI), as a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remain unclear., OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between ACI and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science to locate all articles published up to 10 April 2020 reporting data of COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors developing ACI as a complication of the infection. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio as the effect measure with the related 95% confidence interval. Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I statistic., RESULTS: Eight studies, enrolling 1686 patients (mean age 59.5 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Data regarding the outcome of patients complicated with ACI were available for 1615 patients. Of these, 387 (23.9%) experienced ACIs as COVID-19 complications during the hospitalization. The incidence of ACI was significantly higher among non survivors when compared with survivors (61.6 vs. 6.7%, P < 0.0001). The pooled analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated with ACI during the disease (odds ratio: 21.6, 95% confidence interval: 8.6-54.4, P < 0.0001, I = 82%)., CONCLUSION: Development of ACI during COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of death during the infection.	false

0	Effect of temperature and humidity on the dynamics of daily new cases and deaths due to COVID-19 outbreak in Gulf countries in Middle East Region. OBJECTIVE: Weather-related dynamics have an impact on the pattern of health and disease. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths due to COVID-19 in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected all the six GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This region has a relatively high temperature and humidity, and has homogenous Arab ethnicity with a similar socioeconomic culture. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, including daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web “Time and Date”. The daily basis, mean temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of COVID-19 in the region, Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020. We also evaluated the growth factor, “a ratio by which a quantity multiplies itself over time; it equals daily cases divided by cases on the previous day”. RESULTS: In GCC countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020 was 29.20 +/- 0.30 degrees C and humidity was 37.95 +/- 4.40%. The results revealed that there was a negative correlation and decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths from COVID-19 with increase in humidity in Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The correlation coefficient between temperature with daily cases shows that an increase in temperature was associated with an increase in daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19, however, the temperature is still gradually rising in the region. The growth factor result for daily cases was 1.09 +/- 0.00 and daily deaths was 1.07 +/- 0.03 for COVID-19, and shows declining trends in GCC region. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in GCC countries. The daily growth factor for patients and deaths shows a declining trend. However, the climate is swiftly changing in the region; further studies may be conducted during the peak of summer season. The findings have outcomes for policymakers and health officials about the impact of temperature and humidity on epidemiological trends of daily new cases and deaths due to COVID-19.	false
0	The COVID-19 Pandemic and Non-communicable Diseases-A Wake-up Call for Primary Health Care System Strengthening in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strengthening Primary Health Care Systems is the most effective policy response in low-and middle-income countries to protect against health emergencies, achieve universal health coverage, and promote health and wellbeing. Despite the Astana declaration on primary health care, respective investment is still insufficient in Sub-Sahara Africa. The SARS-CoV-2019 pandemic is a reminder that non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are increasingly prevalent in Sub-Sahara Africa, are closely interlinked to the burden of communicable diseases, exacerbating morbidity and mortality. Governments and donors should use the momentum created by the pandemic in a sustainable and effective way by pivoting health spending towards primary health care.	false
0	Safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pneumonia: A retrospective cohort study. Background: Cytokine release storm (CRS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is thought to be the cause for organ damage and death which is independent of the actual viral burden. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of CRS. We describe the efficacy and safety of TCZ in SARS CoV-2 pneumonia., Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 20 2020 to May 21 2020. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of a composite of either need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Safety outcomes included an increase in liver transaminases and/or evidence of infection., Results: A total of 20 patients received TCZ during the study period. The median age was 54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47-63). About 85% of the patients were male. Nearly 70% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. About 55% required ICU admission. The median duration of ICU stay was 11 days (95% CI: 3-13 days). The cumulative incidence of the requirement for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvement and mortality was 11% (95% CI: 0.03%-1%), 74% (95% CI 37%-89%) and 25% (95% CI: 11%-63%), respectively. There was no difference in outcomes according to age, gender or computed tomography severity score. Asymptomatic transaminitis was the most common drug reaction (55%), and one patient developed bacteraemia., Conclusions: TCZ is likely a safe and effective modality of treatment for improving clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS CoV-2 patients with a reduction in ICU stay and ventilatory care need.	false

To scientifically evaluate the intervention effect of Chinese medicine preventive administration(combined use of Huo-xiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid and Jinhao Jiere Granules) on community population in the case of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), a large cohort, prospective, randomized, and parallel-controlled clinical study was conducted. Total 22 065 subjects were included and randomly divided into 2 groups. The non-intervention group was given health guidance only, while the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) intervention group was given two coordinated TCM in addition to health guidance. The medical instructions were as follows. Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid: oral before meals, 10 mL/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days. Jinhao Jiere Granules: dissolve in boiling water and take after meals, 8 g/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days, followed up for 14 days, respectively. The study found that with the intake of medication, the incidence rate of TCM intervention group was basically maintained at a low and continuous stable level(0.01%-0.02%), while the non-intervention group showed an overall trend of continuous growth(0.02%-0.18%) from 3 to 14 days. No suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case occurred in either group. There were 2 cases of colds in the TCM intervention group and 26 cases in the non-intervention group. The incidence of colds in the TCM intervention group was significantly lower(P<0.05) than that in the non-intervention group. In the population of 16-60 years old, the incidence rate of non-intervention and intervention groups were 0.01% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference of colds incidence between the two groups was statistically significant(P<0.05). In the population older than 60 years old, they were 0.04% and 0.21%, respectively. The incidence of colds in the non-intervention group was higher than that in the intervention group, but not reaching statistical difference. The protection rate of TCM for the whole population was 91.8%, especially for the population of age 16-60(95.0%). It was suggested that TCM intervention(combined use of Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid and Jinhao Jiere Granules) could effectively protect community residents against respiratory diseases, such as colds, which was worthy of promotion in the community. In addition, in terms of safety, the incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions in the TCM intervention group was relatively low, which was basically consistent with the drug instructions.	false
0	Prophylactic and Therapeutic Inhibition of In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Oleandrin. With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 mug/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 mug/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC 50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 mug/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 mug/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection., IMPORTANCE: COVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.	false
0	"Public Opinions towards COVID-19 in California and New York on Twitter. BACKGROUND: With the pandemic of COVID-19 and the release of related policies, discussions about the COVID-19 are widespread online. Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States., METHODS: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19., RESULTS: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with ""protective measures"" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states., CONCLUSIONS: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences."	false
0	Antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 are distinct in children with MIS-C compared to adults with COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.	false
0	Characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and progression: A multicenter, retrospective study. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally since the end of 2019. Asymptomatic carriers are of great concern as they can undermine the interventions to stop the pandemic. However, there is limited information about the characteristics and outcomes of the asymptomatic patients. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study and retrieved data of 79 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at admission from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The asymptomatic patients could happen at any age, ranged from 9 to 96 years. These patients also had lower levels of alanine aminotransferase and C-reactive protein. Patchy shadowing was the most common manifestation in computed tomography scan. Some asymptomatic carriers developed mild or moderate symptoms during hospitalization. Age and comorbidities, especially hypertension, may be predictive factors for symptom development in the initially asymptomatic carriers at admission. Early detection and treatment for these presymptomatic patients before symptom onset can shorten the communicable period for the coronavirus and reduce the occurrence of severe cases.	false
0	Physical exercise as a tool to help the immune system against COVID-19: an integrative review of the current literature. Acute viral respiratory infections are the main infectious disease in the world. In 2020, a new disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global pandemic. The immune response to the virus depends on factors such as genetics, age and physical state, and its main input receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The practice of physical exercises acts as a modulator of the immune system. During and after physical exercise, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released, lymphocyte circulation increases, as well as cell recruitment. Such practice has an effect on the lower incidence, intensity of symptoms and mortality in viral infections observed in people who practice physical activity regularly, and its correct execution must be considered to avoid damage. The initial response is given mainly by type I interferons (IFN-I), which drive the action macrophages and lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte action. A suppression of the IFN-I response has been noted in COVID-19. Severe conditions have been associated with storms of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia, as well as circulatory changes and virus dispersion to other organs. The practice of physical activities strengthens the immune system, suggesting a benefit in the response to viral communicable diseases. Thus, regular practice of adequate intensity is suggested as an auxiliary tool in strengthening and preparing the immune system for COVID-19. Further studies are needed to associate physical exercise with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Estimated County-Level Prevalence of Selected Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Increased Risk for Severe COVID-19 Illness - United States, 2018. Risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated illness (illness requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in death) increases with increasing age as well as presence of underlying medical conditions that have shown strong and consistent evidence, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity (1-4). Identifying and describing the prevalence of these conditions at the local level can help guide decision-making and efforts to prevent or control severe COVID-19-associated illness. Below state-level estimates, there is a lack of standardized publicly available data on underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. A small area estimation approach was used to estimate county-level prevalence of selected conditions associated with severe COVID-19 disease among U.S. adults aged >=18 years (5,6) using self-reported data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and U.S. Census population data. The median prevalence of any underlying medical condition in residents among 3,142 counties in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) was 47.2% (range = 22.0%-66.2%); counties with the highest prevalence were concentrated in the Southeast and Appalachian region. Whereas the estimated number of persons with any underlying medical condition was higher in population-dense metropolitan areas, overall prevalence was higher in rural nonmetropolitan areas. These data can provide important local-level information about the estimated number and proportion of persons with certain underlying medical conditions to help guide decisions regarding additional resource investment, and mitigation and prevention measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.	false
0	Comorbidities and the risk of severe or fatal outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are inconsistent and insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19., METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the rates of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity and the country of residence. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models., RESULTS: A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal COVID-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidities were obesity (42%, 95% CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95% CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95% CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95% CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95% CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95% CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95% CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95% CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the comorbidities in patients with severe or fatal COVID-19 when compared to patients with non-severe/fatal COVID-19 were as follows: chronic respiratory disease, OR 3.56 (95% CI 2.87-4.41); hypertension, OR 3.17 (95% CI 2.46-4.08); cardiovascular disease, OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.65-3.70); kidney disease, OR 3.02 (95% CI 2.23-4.08); cerebrovascular disease, OR 2.74 (95% CI 1.59-4.74); malignancy, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.73-4.21); diabetes, OR 2.63 (95% CI 2.08-3.33); and obesity, OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.04-2.85). No correlation was observed between liver disease and COVID-19 aggravation (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.95-2.49)., CONCLUSIONS: Chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy are clinical risk factors for a severe or fatal outcome associated with COVID-19, with obesity being the most prevalent and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. Knowledge of these risk factors could help clinicians better identify and manage the high-risk populations. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.	false
0	A study on human serum albumin corona formed on photoluminescent carbon dots. Fluorescence nanostructures have been widely applied in the biomedical field as therapeutic agents and as novel tools for labeling, imaging, and sensing. However, the protein corona will dramatically influence the predesigned properties of nanostructures in serum. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of protein corona formation on nanostructures. Photoluminescent carbon dots have been widely applied in the biomedical field since their discovery. Due to the large overlap between the absorption spectra of proteins and the fluorescence spectra of photoluminescent carbon dots, herein we investigate the mechanism of human serum albumin corona formed on photoluminescent carbon dots using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. By employing spectroscopic methods, the binding constants and the number of binding sites between human serum albumin and photoluminescent carbon dots have been determined, and the corresponding thermodynamics are also discussed as well for the interaction between photoluminescent carbon dots and human serum albumin. In addition, we successfully demonstrate the photoluminescent carbon dots in labeling bean sprouts. We believe that the current research cannot shed light on the mechanism of protein corona formation on nanostructures, but also could benefit the design of hybrid nanomaterial which will be applied to serum environments.	false
0	Neonatal outcome in 29 pregnant women with COVID-19: A retrospective study in Wuhan, China. Background As of June 1, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 6,000,000 infected persons and 360,000 deaths globally. Previous studies revealed pregnant women with COVID-19 had similar clinical manifestations to nonpregnant women. However, little is known about the outcome of neonates born to infected women. Methods and findings In this retrospective study, we studied 29 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection delivered in 2 designated general hospitals in Wuhan, China between January 30 and March 10, 2020, and 30 neonates (1 set of twins). Maternal demographic characteristics, delivery course, symptoms, and laboratory tests from hospital records were extracted. Neonates were hospitalized if they had symptoms (5 cases) or their guardians agreed to a hospitalized quarantine (13 cases), whereas symptom-free neonates also could be discharged after birth and followed up through telephone (12 cases). For hospitalized neonates, laboratory test results and chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) were extracted from hospital records. The presence of antibody of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in the serum of 4 neonates. Among 29 pregnant COVID-19-infected women (13 confirmed and 16 clinical diagnosed), the majority had higher education (56.6%), half were employed (51.7%), and their mean age was 29 years. Fourteen women experienced mild symptoms including fever (8), cough (9), shortness of breath (3), diarrhea (2), vomiting (1), and 15 were symptom-free. Eleven of 29 women had pregnancy complications, and 27 elected to have a cesarean section delivery. Of 30 neonates, 18 were admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital for quarantine and care, whereas the other 12 neonates discharged after birth without any symptoms and had normal follow-up. Five hospitalized neonates were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection (2 confirmed and 3 suspected). In addition, 12 of 13 other hospitalized neonates presented with radiological features for pneumonia through X-ray or CT screening, 1 with occasional cough and the others without associated symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 specific serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in 4 neonates and 2 were positive. The limited sample size limited statistical comparison between groups. Conclusions In this study, we observed COVID-19 or radiological features of pneumonia in some, but not all, neonates born to women with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that intrauterine or intrapartum transmission is possible and warrants clinical caution and further investigation.	false
0	Vascular occlusion by neutrophil extracellular traps in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be complicated by severe organ damage leading to dysfunction of the lungs and other organs. The processes that trigger organ damage in COVID-19 are incompletely understood., METHODS: Samples were donated from hospitalized patients. Sera, plasma, and autopsy-derived tissue sections were examined employing flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemistry., PATIENT FINDINGS: Here, we show that severe COVID-19 is characterized by a highly pronounced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) inside the micro-vessels. Intravascular aggregation of NETs leads to rapid occlusion of the affected vessels, disturbed microcirculation, and organ damage. In severe COVID-19, neutrophil granulocytes are strongly activated and adopt a so-called low-density phenotype, prone to spontaneously form NETs. In accordance, markers indicating NET turnover are consistently increased in COVID-19 and linked to disease severity. Histopathology of the lungs and other organs from COVID-19 patients showed congestions of numerous micro-vessels by aggregated NETs associated with endothelial damage., INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19 is associated with excessive NET formation and vascular damage., FUNDING: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), EU, Volkswagen-Stiftung.

0	Myocardial injury and COVID-19: Serum hs-cTnl level in risk stratification and the prediction of 30-day fatality in COVID-19 patients with no prior cardiovascular disease. Introduction: To explore the involvement of the cardiovascular system in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated whether myocardial injury occurred in COVID-19 patients and assessed the performance of serum high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnl) levels in predicting disease severity and 30-day in-hospital fatality. Methods: We included 244 COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with no preexisting cardiovascular disease or renal dysfunction. We analyzed the data including patients' clinical characteristics, cardiac biomarkers, severity of medical conditions, and 30-day in-hospital fatality. We performed multivariable Cox regressions and the receiver operating characteristic analysis to assess the association of cardiac biomarkers on admission with disease severity and prognosis. Results: In this retrospective observational study, 11% of COVID-19 patients had increased hs-cTnl levels (>40 ng/L) on admission. Of note, serum hs-cTnl levels were positively associated with the severity of medical conditions (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 6.00 [6.00-6.00] ng/L in 91 patients with moderate conditions, 6.00 [6.00-18.00] ng/L in 107 patients with severe conditions, and 11.00 [6.00-56.75] ng/L in 46 patients with critical conditions, P for trend=0.001). Moreover, compared with those with normal cTnl levels, patients with increased hs-cTnl levels had higher in-hospital fatality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 4.79 [1.46-15.69]). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the inclusion of hs-cTnl levels into a panel of empirical prognostic factors substantially improved the prediction performance for severe or critical conditions (area under the curve (AUC): 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78) vs. 0.65 (0.58-0.72), P=0.01), as well as for 30-day fatality (AUC: 0.91 (0.85-0.96) vs. 0.77 (0.62-0.91), P=0.04). A cutoff value of 20 ng/L of hs-cTnl level led to the best prediction to 30-day fatality. Conclusions: In COVID-19 patients with no preexisting cardiovascular disease, 11% had increased hs-cTnl levels. Besides empirical prognostic factors, serum hs-cTnl levels upon admission provided independent prediction to both the severity of the medical condition and 30-day in-hospital fatality. These findings may shed important light on the clinical management of COVID-19.	false
0	The Role of Glutathione in Protecting against the Severe Inflammatory Response Triggered by COVID-19. The novel COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the world's population differently: mostly in the presence of conditions such as aging, diabetes and hypertension the virus triggers a lethal cytokine storm and patients die from acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas in many cases the disease has a mild or even asymptomatic progression. A common denominator in all conditions associated with COVID-19 appears to be the impaired redox homeostasis responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation; therefore, levels of glutathione (GSH), the key anti-oxidant guardian in all tissues, could be critical in extinguishing the exacerbated inflammation that triggers organ failure in COVID-19. The present review provides a biochemical investigation of the mechanisms leading to deadly inflammation in severe COVID-19, counterbalanced by GSH. The pathways competing for GSH are described to illustrate the events concurring to cause a depletion of endogenous GSH stocks. Drawing on evidence from literature that demonstrates the reduced levels of GSH in the main conditions clinically associated with severe disease, we highlight the relevance of restoring GSH levels in the attempt to protect the most vulnerable subjects from severe symptoms of COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the current data about the feasibility of increasing GSH levels, which could be used to prevent and subdue the disease.	false
0	Postdischarge symptoms and rehabilitation needs in survivors of COVID-19 infection: A cross-sectional evaluation. BACKGROUND: There is currently very limited information on the nature and prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms after hospital discharge., METHODS: A purposive sample of 100 survivors discharged from a large University hospital were assessed 4 to 8 weeks after discharge by a multidisciplinary team of rehabilitation professionals using a specialist telephone screening tool designed to capture symptoms and impact on daily life. EQ-5D-5L telephone version was also completed., RESULTS: Participants were between 29 and 71 days (mean 48 days) postdischarge from hospital. Thirty-two participants required treatment in intensive care unit (ICU group) and 68 were managed in hospital wards without needing ICU care (ward group). New illness-related fatigue was the most common reported symptom by 72% participants in ICU group and 60.3% in ward group. The next most common symptoms were breathlessness (65.6% in ICU group and 42.6% in ward group) and psychological distress (46.9% in ICU group and 23.5% in ward group). There was a clinically significant drop in EQ5D in 68.8% in ICU group and in 45.6% in ward group., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from the United Kingdom reporting on postdischarge symptoms. We recommend planning rehabilitation services to manage these symptoms appropriately and maximize the functional return of COVID-19 survivors. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	COVID-19 Severity in Europe and the USA: Could the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Play a Role?. The factors affecting COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity have been widely discussed. The role that seasonal influenza vaccinations may play is generally not included in the debate. We performed an analysis investigating a possible link between the vaccination coverage rate (VCR) in the elderly (>= 65 years of age) and COVID-19 infection risk or disease severity. Data from Europe (country-wise) and the USA (state-wise) were investigated separately. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the VCR and reported COVID-19 incidence, as well as mortality for Europe and the USA. A statistically significant positive correlation was also found between the VCR and the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for Europe. For the USA, the VCR/CFR correlation was not statistically significant. Our analysis indicates that receiving seasonal influenza vaccination(s) in the past might be an additional risk factor for the elderly in terms of enhanced susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and higher likelihood of a lethal outcome in case of infection. More research about this possible risk factor is urgently needed.	false

0	Regional anesthesia in the time of COVID-19: a minireview. The treatment of surgical patients who are confirmed or suspected of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a challenge for all anesthesiologists. The safety of both patients and healthcare workers should be taken into consideration when performing anesthesia management for patients with COVID-19. General anesthesia requiring airway intervention may exacerbate COVID-19 pneumonia, and aerosol generation during airway intervention risks COVID-19 transmission to medical staff. However, regional anesthesia is not an aerosol-generating procedure. The neuraxial anesthesia may have little adverse influence on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 after reviewing previous case reports. Regional anesthesia may have some advantages over general anesthesia for this group of patients, but unplanned conversion to general anesthesia during surgery is not preferred. Thus, careful consideration should be given to ensure that the surgery is performed entirely under regional anesthesia. The use of ultrasound guidance and the performance by an experienced physician may reduce the incidence of failed block and complications. The use of long-acting local anesthetic prolongs the anesthetic effect of regional anesthesia. Besides, a safe and sufficient dose of local anesthetic should be used.	false
0	Screening testing for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to rehabilitation hospitals in a high COVID-19 prevalence community. INTRODUCTION: While planning for the care of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic crisis has dominated the focus of leaders of inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), patients with injuries/ illnesses unrelated to COVID-19 continue to need inpatient rehabilitation admission. To maintain a safe environment for all patients and staff, we established an admission screening plan of testing for SARS-CoV-2 to determine the presence of asymptomatic patients who were infected with the virus upon admission. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the prevalence of patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 but were presumed to be COVID-19 negative at the time of admission to IRF in New Jersey. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing results. SETTING: Four freestanding IRFs in New Jersey operated as one system. PATIENTS: All (N=103) patients sequentially admitted from April 4 -27, 2020 with no symptoms or evidence of COVID-19 disease at the time of transfer from the acute hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis at the time of admission to the IRF and patients were monitored for subsequent symptom development over the next 14days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of SARS-CoV-2 testing upon admission and evidence of development of clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19. RESULT(S): Seven asymptomatic persons (6.8% of admissions) without clinical signs/symptoms of COVID-19 tested positive on admission. Of these, five developed symptoms of COVID-19, with a mean onset of 3.2 (range of 2-5) days. Five additional patients became symptomatic and tested positive within the next 3-10days (mean of 5.2days). Overall, 11.6% of admissions (12/103) had a positive test within 14days of admission. CONCLUSION(S): Admission testing to post-acute centers for SARS-CoV-2 can help identify pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, especially in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent. Negative results however, do not preclude COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Epidemiology and clinical features of emergency department patients with suspected COVID-19: Results from the first month of the COVID-19 Emergency Department Quality Improvement Project (COVED-2). Objective: The aim of the present study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of ED patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. Method(s): The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Project is an ongoing prospective cohort study that includes all adult patients presenting to The Alfred Hospital ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Current guidelines recommend testing for patients with fevers or chills, acute respiratory symptoms or a high-risk exposure history, as well as implementation of infection prevention and control precautions for all suspected and confirmed cases. Study outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and intensive respiratory support. Result(s): In the period 1-30 April 2020, 702 of 3453 ED patients (20%; 95% CI 19-22) were tested, with a significant increase during the study period (incident rate ratio 1.019; 95% confidence interval 1.017-1.021, P < 0.001). The primary outcome of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded in 14 patients (2%; 95% confidence interval 1-3). Shortness of breath (77%), fatigue (100%), myalgia (67%) and diarrhoea (67%) were common among positive cases, while close contact (9%), fever (0%) and healthcare occupation (0%) were not. No positive cases required intensive respiratory support in the ED. Conclusion(s): The volume of ED patients with suspected COVID-19 is increasing. Low numbers of positive cases precluded development of accurate predictive tools, but the COVED Project is fulfilling an important role in monitoring the burden of infection prevention and control requirements on the ED. The increasing number of patients meeting isolation criteria has the potential to impact on patient flow and may lead to ED overcrowding.Copyright © 2020 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine	false
0	Evaluation of three fully-automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Objectives Serological assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are increasingly used during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-Coronavirus-2. Here we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Methods A total of 186 samples from 58 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were measured using SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Siemens Healthineers, Roche Diagnostics and Euroimmun. Additionally, 123 control samples, including samples collected before December 2019 and samples with potential cross-reactive antibodies were analyzed. Diagnostic specificity, sensitivity, agreement between assays and ROC curve-derived optimized thresholds were determined. Furthermore, intra- and inter-assay precision and the potential impact of interfering substances were investigated. Results SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Siemens and Roche showed 100% specificity. The Euroimmun assay had 98 and 100% specificity, when borderline results are considered as positive or negative, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity for samples collected >=14 days after PCR-positivity was 97.0, 89.4 and 95.5% using the Siemens, Roche and Euroimmun assay, respectively. Sensitivity of the Roche assay can be increased using an optimized cut-off index (0.095). However, a simultaneous decrease in specificity (98.4%) was observed. Siemens showed 95.8 and 95.5% overall agreement with results of Euroimmun and Roche assay, respectively. Euroimmun and Roche assay exhibited 92.6% overall agreement. Discordant results were observed in three COVID-19 patients and in one COVID-19 patient none of the investigated assays detected antibodies. Conclusions The investigated assays were highly specific and sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples obtained >=14 days after PCR-confirmed infection. Discordant results need to be investigated in further studies.	false

0	Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on cancer treatment: the patients' perspective. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has inevitable consequences for medical care of patients without COVID-19. To assess the impact of this pandemic on oncological care, a nationwide survey was conducted among patients with cancer in the Netherlands. Method(s): The patients' perspective on oncological care was investigated using an online survey between March 29th 2020 and April 18th 2020. The survey consisted of 20 questions on four topics: patients' characteristics, contact with the hospital, consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns about COVID-19. Result(s): Five thousand three hundred two patients with cancer completed this nationwide survey. Overall, 30% of patients reported consequences for their oncological treatment or follow-up. In the majority of cases, this resulted in conversion from hospital visit to consultation by phone or video. The most frequently adjusted treatments were chemotherapy (30%) and immunotherapy (32%). Among patients with delay and discontinuation of treatment, 55% and 63% of patients, respectively, were (very) concerned about these consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequences were independent of regional differences in COVID-19 incidence. However, patients in regions with high COVID-19 incidence were significantly more concerned. Conclusion(s): This is the first study investigating perspectives of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care, indicating the need for psycho-oncological support during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Pros and cons for use of statins in people with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Background and aims: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD. This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19. Method(s): We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. Result(s): Statins, with their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, have the potential to reduce severity of lung injury in, and mortality from, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Statin-induced upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has the potential to reduce lung injury from excess angiotensin II. By disrupting lipid rafts, statins have the potential to reduce viral entry into cells. However, benefit-risk ratio of its complex interaction with MYD88 gene expression on outcomes in COVID-19, and the putative role of low serum LDL cholesterol in increasing severity of SARS-CoV2 infection need further clarification. Conclusion(s): People with COVID-19, who are already on statins for an underlying co-morbid condition, should continue on it unless there are specific contraindications. De-novo use of statins in people with COVID-19 with no underlying co-morbidity might be beneficial but awaits substantiation in clinical trials; till that time, de novo use of statins in COVID 19 should be limited to a clinical trial setting.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical Characteristics and In-Hospital Mortality for COVID-19 Across The Globe. Introduction: Numerous case series have reported on the baseline characteristics and in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19, however, these studies included patients localized in a specific geographic region. The purpose of our study was to identify differences in the clinical characteristics and the in-hospital mortality of patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 internationally. Method(s): A comprehensive search of all published literature on adult patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 that reported on the clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality was performed. Groups were compared using a Chi-square test with Yates correction of continuity. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result(s): After screening 516 studies across the globe, 43 studies from 12 countries were included in our final analysis. Patients with COVID-19 in America and Europe were older compared to their Asian counterparts. Europe had the highest percentage of male patients. American and European patients had a higher incidence of co-morbid conditions (p < 0.05 for all variables). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in America (22.23%) and Europe (22.9%) compared to Asia (12.65%) (p < 0.0001), but no difference was seen when compared with each other (p = 0.49). Conclusion(s): There is a significant variation in the clinical characteristics in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 across the globe. In-hospital mortality is similar between America and Europe, but considerably higher than Asia.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	THYROTOXICOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19: THE THYRCOV STUDY. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed thyroid function in patients affected by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 may influence thyroid function and/or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may directly act on thyroid cells, such as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1 infection., DESIGN AND METHODS: This single-center study was retrospective and consisted in evaluating thyroid function tests and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) values in 287 consecutive patients (193 males, mean age 64.3+/-14.0 years, range: 27-92), hospitalized for COVID-19 in non-intensive care units., RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (20.2%) were found with thyrotoxicosis (overt in 31 cases), 15 (5.2%) with hypothyroidism (overt in only 2 cases), 214 (74.6%) with normal thyroid function. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) values were inversely correlated with age of patients (rho -0.27; p<0.001) and IL-6 (rho -0.41; p<0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, thyrotoxicosis resulted to be significantly associated with higher IL-6 (odds ratio 3.25, 95% confidence interval 1.97-5.36; p<0.001), whereas the association with age of patients was lost (p=0.09)., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a first evidence that COVID-19 may be associated with high risk of thyrotoxicosis in relationship with systemic immune activation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus. A SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein amino acid change D614G has become the most prevalent form in the global pandemic. Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional, and municipal. The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to a higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals, G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity. These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus and support continuing surveillance of Spike mutations to aid with development of immunological interventions.

0	Hyperinflammation with COVID-19: The key to patient deterioration?. Background: The potential risk of cytokine storm in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described [1]; we write to share our experience treating a 17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection. Case report: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Result(s): The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24 h. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48 h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11 days feeling fit and well. Conclusion(s): This case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question - is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally having a profound effect on lives of millions of people, causing worldwide economic disruption. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.

0	Common phobias among Egyptian primary schoolchildren: An emergency trigger for panic disorder due to corona pandemic. BACKGROUND: In the wake of the adverse situation we are currently facing globally due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, it is normal to feel stressed, confused, and scared but what is abnormal is to turn this to panic. Phobias are more pronounced than fears. They develop when a person has an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger that may be evolved to experience panic attacks. AIM: Our objective was to identify the prevalence of most common phobias as well as panic disorder (PD) due to the coronavirus pandemic among Egyptian primary schoolchildren and their determinants. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2015 schoolchildren from 3 to 6 grades in three governorates of Egypt. Seven types of phobias were investigated: Agoraphobia, phobias from darkness, animal, untreatable illness (mainly coronavirus), insects, height, and social phobia. The child's self-reported PD symptoms were assessed using DSM-IV with psychiatric diagnoses. RESULT(S): Almost two-thirds of the surveyed primary schoolchildren have phobias of the low score (<9) versus one-third who had high phobias score (61.% vs. 35%, respectively) with highly significant difference (p < 0.001). The most prevalent phobias were from heights (66.5%) followed by darkness (60.0%). The important predictors of phobias were: Being a male child, living in an urban area, and studying at governmental school at fifth or sixth-grade residence. The prevalence of PD due to the corona epidemic is very high, it is reported by almost half of the surveyed primary schoolchildren. Fear of losing any of their family members, especially grandparents, was reported to be the highest PD symptom (97%). CONCLUSION(S): Phobia from heights and darkness was the most common. The prevalence of PD due to the coronavirus epidemic is reported to be very high. Calming down children who might be experienced with a phobia that is triggering their PD is recommended.Copyright: © 2020 A. M. Metwally, Marwa M. El-Sonbaty, Ghada A. Abdel-Latif, Lobna A.

0	Environmental sampling for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during COVID-19 outbreak in the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the Diamond Princess cruise ship and we sampled environmental surfaces after passengers and crews vacated the cabins. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from 58 out of 601 samples (10%) from case-cabins 1-17 days after the cabins were vacated, but not from non-case-cabins. There was no difference in the detection proportion between cabins for symptomatic (15%, 28/189, Cq: 29.79-38.86) and asymptomatic cases (21%, 28/131, Cq: 26.21-38.99). No SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from any of the samples. Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients may be similar and environmental surfaces could be involved in viral transmission. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Profiles of liver function abnormalities in elderly patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: The profiles of liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients need to be clarified., METHODS: In this retrospective study, consecutive COVID-19 patients over 60 years old in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6 were included. Data of demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, medications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sequential alterations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored., RESULTS: 330 patients were included and classified into two groups with normal (n=234) or elevated ALT (n=96). There were fewer females (40.6% vs 54.7%, P=0.020) and more critical cases (30.2% vs. 19.2%, P=0.026) in patients with elevated ALT compared to the normal group. Higher levels of bacterial infection indices (e.g. white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) were observed in the elevated group. Spearman correlation showed that both ALT and AST levels were positively correlated with those indices of bacterial infection. No obvious effects of medications on ALT abnormalities were found. In patients with elevated ALT, most ALT elevations were mild and transient. 59.4% of the patients had ALT concentrations of 41-100 U/L, while only a few patients (5.2%) had high serum ALT concentrations above 300 U/L. ALT elevations occurred at 13 (10-17) days and recovered at 28 (18-35) days from disease onset. For most patients, the elevation of serum ALT levels occurred at 6-20 days after disease onset and reached their peak values within a similar time frame. The recovery of serum ALT levels to normal frequently occurred at 16-20 days or 31-35 days after disease onset., CONCLUSIONS: Liver function abnormalities were observed in 29.1% of the elderly COVID-19 patients, which were slightly and transient in most cases. Liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 may be correlated with bacterial infection. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Performance characteristics of a high throughput automated transcription mediated amplification test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has imposed severe challenges on laboratories in their effort to achieve sufficient diagnostic testing capability for identifying infected individuals. In this study we report the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of a new, high-throughput, fully automated nucleic acid amplification test system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The assay utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and acridinium ester-labeled probe chemistry on the automated Panther System to directly amplify and detect two separate target sequences in the ORF1ab region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. The probit 95% limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 0.004 TCID50/ml using inactivated virus, and 25 c/ml using synthetic in vitro transcript RNA targets. Analytical sensitivity (100% detection) was confirmed to be 83 - 194 c/ml using three commercially available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid controls. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with testing six related human coronaviruses, as well as 24 other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, at high titer. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen testing (N=140) showed 100%, 98.7%, and 99.3% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively, with a validated reverse transcription PCR NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These results provide validation evidence for a sensitive and specific method for pandemic-scale automated molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Pham et al.	false
0	Epidemiology of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among COVID-19 intubated patients: a prospective study. BACKGROUND: In this study we evaluated the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among intubated patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluated different case definitions of invasive aspergillosis. METHOD(S): Prospective, multicentre study on adult patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. All included participants underwent screening protocol for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan and cultures performed on admission at 7 days and in case of clinical deterioration. Cases were classified as coronavirus associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) according to previous consensus definitions. The new definition was compared with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (PIPA). RESULT(S): A total of 108 patients were enrolled. Probable CAPA was diagnosed in 30 (27.7%) of patients after a median of 4 (2-8) days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant higher 30-day mortality rate from ICU admission among patients with either CAPA (44% vs 19%, p= 0.002) or PIPA (74% vs 26%, p<0.001) when compared with patients not fulfilling criteria for aspergillosis. The association between CAPA [OR 3.53 (95%CI 1.29-9.67), P=0.014] or PIPA [OR 11.60 (95%CI 3.24-41.29) p<0.001] with 30-day mortality from ICU admission was confirmed even after adjustment for confounders with a logistic regression model. Among patients with CAPA receiving voriconazole treatment (13 patients, 43%) A trend toward lower mortality (46% vs 59% p=0.30) and reduction of galactomannan index in consecutive samples was observed. CONCLUSION(S): We found a high incidence of CAPA among critically ill COVID-19 patients and that its occurrence seems to change the natural history of disease.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Molecular basis of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The review summarizes the publications, available at the time it was written, addressing the chemical and biological processes that occur in the human body upon exposure to coronaviruses, in particular SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms of viral particle entry into the cell, viral replication and impact on the immune system and on oxygen transport system are considered. The causes behind complications of the viral infection, such as vasculitis, thrombosis, cytokine storm and lung fibrosis, are discussed. The latest research in the field of small molecule medications to counteract the virus is surveyed. Molecular targets and possible vectors to exploit them are considered. The review is primarily written for specialists who want to understand the chains of activation, replication, action and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the short period of such studies, the data on complexes of small molecule compounds with possible protein targets are not numerous, but they will be useful in the search and synthesis of new potentially effective drugs.	false

COVID-19 pandemic challenges the health systems worldwide and influences the treatments for other diseases. The incidence rate of breast cancer ranks first among all malignant tumors among women. During the pandemic, medical workers should strictly monitor the condition of patients and strengthen the management and prevention measures to make sure patients can be operated safely. This article will discuss the arrangements and management of surgical treatment for patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2020 Liu et al.	false
0	Protective Immunity against SARS Subunit Vaccine Candidates Based on Spike Protein: Lessons for Coronavirus Vaccine Development. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has highlighted the threat that highly pathogenic coronaviruses have on global health security and the imminent need to design an effective vaccine for prevention purposes. Although several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infections since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, there is no available licensed vaccine yet. A better understanding of previous coronavirus vaccine studies may help to design a vaccine for the newly emerged virus, SARS-CoV-2, that may also cover other pathogenic coronaviruses as a potentially universal vaccine. In general, coronavirus spike protein is the major antigen for the vaccine design as it can induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity. By considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, here, protective immunity against SARS-CoV spike subunit vaccine candidates in animal models has been reviewed to gain advances that can facilitate coronavirus vaccine development in the near future.

0	"Analysis of the influence of the psychology changes of fear induced by the COVID-19 epidemic on the body. In this paper, the theory of "" Fear injury kidney "" in traditional Chinese medicine is systematically reviewed, and it is found that long-term or excessive psychological changes of fear are likely to damage kidney qi and kidney essence. On this basis, the psychological studies of patients, medical staff and the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China were analyzed, and fear psychology was found to be prevalent among all kinds of people. Modern researches on ""Fear injury kidney"" have also found that long-term or excessive fear could cause changes in the neuro-endocrine-immune system, which can induce diseases or susceptibility to some diseases. Therefore, during or after the prevalence of COVID-19, different groups of people may have emotional reactions such as stress and fear, which should be paid long-term attention, and the influence of fear on the body cannot be ignored. According to the change rule of psychological state under stress reaction, we should actively respond to and take psychological crisis intervention measures in time to reduce the harm of psychological stress to the body.Copyright © 2020"	false
0	Obesity is a risk factor for developing critical condition in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The disease course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic infection to critical condition leading to mortality. Identification of prognostic factors is important for prevention and early treatment. We aimed to examine whether obesity is a risk factor for the critical condition in COVID-19 patients by performing a meta-analysis. The review protocol was registered onto PROSPERO (CRD42020185980). A systematic search was performed in five scientific databases between 1 January and 11 May 2020. After selection, 24 retrospective cohort studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in meta-analysis. Obesity was a significant risk factor for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in a homogenous dataset (OR = 1.21, CI: 1.002-1.46; I2 = 0.0%) as well as for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (OR = 2.05, CI: 1.16-3.64; I2 = 34.86%) in COVID-19. Comparing body mass index (BMI) classes with each other, we found that a higher BMI always carries a higher risk. Obesity may serve as a clinical predictor for adverse outcomes; therefore, the inclusion of BMI in prognostic scores and improvement of guidelines for the intensive care of patients with elevated BMI are highly recommended.

0	COVID-19 in children in Brunei Darussalam: Higher incidence but mild manifestations. Brunei Darussalam documented its first pediatric (<= 12 years) case of the novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the 10th March 2020 and to date, there is a total of 12 confirmed cases. All were diagnosed through contact tracing of family members, typically fathers. All remained stable during their hospitalization. Most (75%) had mild symptoms and did not require specific treatment for COVID-19. The median length of hospitalization was 14 days (the duration of required isolation). In summary, we reported a higher incidence of COVID-19 in children, but with mild manifestations and no sequelae or complications on follow up. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Consensus on recommendations for safe sexual activity during the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Sexual activity offers numerous advantages for physical and mental health but maintains inherent risks in a pandemic situation, such as the current one caused by SARS-CoV-2. A group of experts from the Spanish Association of Sexuality and Mental Health (AESexSAME) has reached a consensus on recommendations to maintain lower-risk sexual activity, depending on one's clinical and partner situations, based on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Different situations are included in the recommendations: a sexual partner passing quarantine without any symptoms, a sexual partner that has not passed quarantine, a sexual partner with some suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, a positive sexual partner with COVID-19, a pregnant sexual partner, a health professional partner in contact with COVID-19 patients, and people without a sexual partner. The main recommendations include returning to engaging in safe sex after quarantine is over (28 days based on the duration one can carry SARS-CoV-2, or 33 days for those who are >60 years old) and all parties are asymptomatic. In all other cases (for those under quarantine, those with some clinical symptoms, health professionals in contact with COVID-19 patients, and during pregnancy), abstaining from coital/oral/anal sex, substituting it with masturbatory or virtual sexual activity to provide maximum protection from the contagion, and increasing the benefits inherent to sexual activity are recommended. For persons without a partner, not initiating sexual activity with a sporadic partner is strongly recommended.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.	false
0	Clinical evaluation of the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 and detection of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated the performance of the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) in the detection of SARS CoV-2 in comparison against three other SARS CoV-2 EUA assays. In these studies, the RP2.1 panel had 98 % positive percent agreement (48/49) and 100 % negative percent agreement (49/49). Since 30 % of nasopharyngeal swab specimens have a SARS CoV-2 Ct >30 and thus detection of virus in low titers is clinically relevant, a sample with a high titer was diluted and each 10 fold dilution was tested in triplicate and compared against 6 other EUA approved SARS CoV-2 assays. These data suggested that the BioFire RP2.1 panel, along with four other SARS CoV-2 assays (Roche cobas, Cepheid Xpert Xpress, BioFire Defense COVID19, and NECoV19), consistently detected viral RNA at the 10-7 dilution. Overall, these studies suggest that the BioFire RP2.1 assay can be used to detect acute cases of SARS CoV2 in addition to patients with low viral titer later in disease presentation.Copyright © 2020	false
0	SARS-Cov-2 Was Not Found in the Peritoneal Fluid of an Asymptomatic Patient Undergoing Laparoscopic Appendectomy. BACKGROUND: The safety of laparoscopic surgery in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients remains unclear. The presence of the virus within peritoneal fluid and the peritoneal tissues is not known. We report an asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patient who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with negative peritoneal sampling for SARS-CoV-2., MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a standard 3 port laparoscopic surgery samples peritoneal fluid, peritoneal brushings, and surgical smoke plum were collected. Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting SARS-CoV-2 were used to detect the presence of the virus in the samples., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on multiple samples of the peritoneum in an asymptomatic patient., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was not found in the peritoneum of a single patient with asymptomatic infection. Further studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 surgical candidates are needed to address safety concerns.	false
0	Response System for and Epidemiological Features of COVID-19 in Gyeongsangnam-do Province in South Korea. BACKGROUND: The South Korean government has been combating COVID-19 outbreak using public information and extensive viral screening. We described the application of the Korean response system in one province and outlined the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in the cohort., METHODS: A Rapid Response Team tracked the patients' activities and identified close contacts. A Patient Management Team made decisions regarding the severity of illness, hospital allocation depending on severity, and time of discharge. A national medical center with 155 beds and 4 university-affiliated hospitals with 48 negative-pressure isolation rooms were dedicated for COVID-19 patients., RESULTS: As of April 15, 17 400 residents were tested, of whom 111 were confirmed positive cases. Of the 111 patients, 78 were cured and discharged, 2 recovered after mechanical ventilation, and none died. One healthcare worker at the national center tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 412 staff members at the center were tested, but there were no additional infections. Cough (30.0 %) was the most common initial symptom, whereas anosmia and ageusia were the first symptoms in 14.7% and 15.7% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 25 patients (22.5%) reported having no symptoms at admission and 7 (6.3%) remained asymptomatic at discharge., CONCLUSIONS: A response system that enabled the early detection of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases, and timely quarantine of these patients and their contacts, along with efficient allocation of medical resources, was the key to curbing the COVID-19 outbreak in Gyeongsangnam-do Province.

0	Laboratory Assay Evaluation Demystified: A Review of Key Factors Influencing Interpretation of Test Results Using Different Assays for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Diagnosis. Laboratory tests are an integral part of the diagnosis and management of patients; however, these tests are far from perfect. Their imperfections can be due to patient health condition, specimen collection, and/or technological difficulty with performing the assay and/or interpretation. To be useful clinically, testing requires calculation of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). During the current global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), multiple assays with unknown clinical sensitivity and specificity have been rapidly developed to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Due to a lack of surveillance testing, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Hence, using this situation as an clinical example, the goal of this article is to clarify the key factors that influence the PPV and NPV yielded by diagnostic testing, By doing so, we hope to offer health-care providers information that will help them better understand the potential implications of utilizing these test results in clinical patient management.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this revision is to summarize the current existing evidence of the potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system and provide the recommendations of the Asociacion Espanola de Andrologia, Medicina Sexual y Reproductiva (ASESA) concerning the implications of COVID-19 infection in the management of male infertilty patients and testicular endocrine dysfunction., METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out., RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed. It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis. COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis. Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory. Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15.8% of patients with COVID-19. However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity. It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results. Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis. With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus. Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function, including male fertility potential and endocrine testicular function. Copyright © 2020.

0	Editorial comment on: Global burden of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. This is an important paper but from my personal observations of how we are handling the pandemic in hospitals, it is perhaps not the risk of dealing with the patients that is the problem. In my institution, we have been fortunate to have sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and we are well protected when entering the ward environment. However, wearing PPE is uncomfortable and it is disposed of on leaving the patient's room. Staff then congregate at the nurses' station and in the offices, where it is impossible to observe social isolation. I believe that the main threat to healthcare workers its other healthcare workers! We have had ward-based outbreaks with staff all contracting the virus simultaneously, presumably from an asymptomatic carrier in the workplace. This issue needs to be urgently addressed.

0	Primary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 protects against reinfection in rhesus macaques. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. It currently remains unclear whether convalescing patients have a risk of reinfection. We generated a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that was characterized by interstitial pneumonia and systemic viral dissemination mainly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Rhesus macaques reinfected with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain during the early recovery phase of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations of viral disease, or histopathological changes. Comparing the humoral and cellular immunity between primary infection and rechallenge revealed notably enhanced neutralizing antibody and immune responses. Our results suggest that primary SARS-CoV-2 exposure protects against subsequent reinfection in rhesus macaques.

0	COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory disease in an adult. Recent reports have described a secondary Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) after a prior COVID-19 infection that often has features of Kawasaki disease (KD). Here, we report the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department hypotensive and tachycardic after 1 week of fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, and was found to have the classic phenotype of complete Kawasaki's Disease including nonexudative conjunctivitis, cracked lips, edema of the hands and feet, palmar erythema, a diffuse maculopapular rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial laboratory studies were significant for hyponatremia, elevated liver function tests including direct hyperbilirubinemia, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Imaging revealed mild gallbladder wall edema, a small area of colitis, and small pleural effusion. She was treated for Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome (KDSS) with pulse dose solumedrol, IVIG, and aspirin with near resolution of symptoms and normalization of vital signs within 1 day and subsequent improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. She was later found to be COVID-19 IgG positive, suggesting past exposure. This case represents an early report of a KD-like illness in an adult with serologic evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, similar to MIS-C. It suggests that the virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome similar to KD in adults, as well as children. Our understanding of the myriad of COVID-19 symptoms and sequelae is rapidly evolving. We recommend physicians remain vigilant for inflammatory syndromes that mimic KD/KDSS which may warrant prompt treatment with IVIG and steroids. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.	false
0	An immunotherapeutic method for COVID-19 patients: a soluble ACE2-Anti-CD16 VHH to block SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The third outbreak of coronavirus (CoV) infection (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) caused by a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) of the genus Beta-coronavirus has become a global pandemic. CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-specific molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.	false
0	COVID-19 and ENT surgery: a brief review of essential precautions and triage. PURPOSE: This study is a brief review of the existing knowledge on the ENT surgeon's approach towards management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is being recommended to carry out only the emergent procedures and to postpone the non-urgent ones to a later date, this article is meant to provide an insight into triage of the ENT procedures and the various precautions to be taken into account by the ENT surgeons while carrying out a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms 'COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery., RESULTS: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater., CONCLUSION: A proper knowledge of triage would be of immense help to the ENT surgeon in minimizing the exposure to health care workers and patients during this pandemic. All patients with an unknown COVID-19 status should be considered suspects and essential precautions for their management be taken accordingly.	false
0	Disappearance of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a Covid-19 patient after recovery. A newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the world. An understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development.

0	AKI in Hospitalized Patients with and without COVID-19: A Comparison Study. BACKGROUND: Reports from centers treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have noted that such patients frequently develop AKI. However, there have been no direct comparisons of AKI in hospitalized patients with and without COVID-19 that would reveal whether there are aspects of AKI risk, course, and outcomes unique to this infection., METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, we evaluated AKI incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for 3345 adults with COVID-19 and 1265 without COVID-19 who were hospitalized in a large New York City health system and compared them with a historical cohort of 9859 individuals hospitalized a year earlier in the same health system. We also developed a model to identify predictors of stage 2 or 3 AKI in our COVID-19., RESULTS: We found higher AKI incidence among patients with COVID-19 compared with the historical cohort (56.9% versus 25.1%, respectively). Patients with AKI and COVID-19 were more likely than those without COVID-19 to require RRT and were less likely to recover kidney function. Development of AKI was significantly associated with male sex, Black race, and older age (>50 years). Male sex and age >50 years associated with the composite outcome of RRT or mortality, regardless of COVID-19 status. Factors that were predictive of stage 2 or 3 AKI included initial respiratory rate, white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase level., CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of severe AKI compared with controls. Vital signs at admission and laboratory data may be useful for risk stratification to predict severe AKI. Although male sex, Black race, and older age associated with development of AKI, these associations were not unique to COVID-19. Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Nephrology.	false
0	Living in the midst of fear: Depressive symptomatology among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The current study examines interrelationships between social vulnerability, individual stressors, social and psychological resources, and depressive symptomatology among US adults during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic., METHODS: Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (n = 10,368 adults) is used in the analysis., RESULTS: On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction., CONCLUSIONS: In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.

0	Telehealth in Urology: A Systematic Review of the Literature. How Much Can Telemedicine Be Useful During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic?. CONTEXT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused increased interest in the application of telehealth to provide care without exposing patients and physicians to the risk of contagion. The urological literature on the topic is sparse., OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate all the available studies on urological applications of telehealth., EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: After registration on PROSPERO, we searched PubMed and Scopus databases to collect any kind of studies evaluating any telehealth interventions in any urological conditions. The National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies was used to estimate the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis was performed., EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 45 studies (11 concerning prostate cancer [PCa], three hematuria management, six urinary stones, 14 urinary incontinence [UI], five urinary tract infections [UTIs], and six other conditions), including 12 randomized controlled trials. The available literature indicates that telemedicine has been implemented successfully in several common clinical scenarios, including the decision-making process following a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa, follow-up care of patients with localized PCa after curative treatments, initial diagnosis of hematuria, management diagnosis and follow-up care of uncomplicated urinary stones and uncomplicated UTIs, and initial evaluation, behavioral therapies, and pelvic floor muscle training in UI patients, as well as follow-up care after surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse. The methodological quality of most of the reports was good., CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has been implemented successfully in selected patients with PCa, UI, pelvic organ prolapse, uncomplicated urinary stones, and UTIs. Many urological conditions are suitable for telehealth, but more studies are needed on other highly prevalent urological malignant and benign conditions. Likely, the COVID-19 pandemic will give a significant boost to the use of telemedicine. More robust data on long-term efficacy, safety, and health economics are necessary., PATIENT SUMMARY: The diffusion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections has recently increased the interest in telehealth, which is the adoption of telecommunication to deliver any health care activity. The available literature indicates that telemedicine has been adopted successfully in selected patients with several common clinical urological conditions, including prostate cancer, uncomplicated urinary stones, uncomplicated urinary infections, urinary incontinence, or pelvic organ prolapse. Likely, the COVID-19 pandemic will give a significant boost to the use of telemedicine, but more robust data on long-term efficacy, safety, and costs are necessary. Copyright © 2020.

0	A Versatile Platform to Incorporate Viral Trimeric Antigens into Self-Assembling Nanoparticle Immunogens. Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens may be complicated by inefficiencies in their production, especially with the metastable glycosylated trimeric type 1 fusion machines that are prevalent viral vaccine targets. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N- linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. Respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer - stabilized in the prefusion conformation by multiple disulfides and fused with SpyCatcher - could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or to ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric antigens from viral respiratory pathogens, including the recently identified SARS-CoV-2.	false

COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed ""non-urgent"" and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.

The pandemic condition Coronavirus-disease (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can take asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe courses. COVID-19 affects primarily the respiratory airways leading to dry cough, fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and diarrhea and can end up in interstitial pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. Reports about the manifestation of various skin lesions and lesions of the vascular system in some subgroups of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients as such features outside the respiratory sphere, are rapidly emerging. Vesicular, urticarial and maculopapular eruptions as well as livedo, necrosis and other vasculitis forms have been reported most frequently in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to update information gained, we provide a systematic overview of the skin lesions described in COVID-19 patients, discuss potential causative factors and describe differential diagnostic evaluations. Moreover, we summarize current knowledge about immunologic, clinical and histologic features of virus- as well as drug-induced lesions of the skin and changes to the vascular system in order to transfer this knowledge to potential mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2.

0	Are Hospitals Safe? A Prospective Study on SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence and Outcome on Surgical Fracture Patients. A Closer Look at Hip Fracture Patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical characteristics of fracture patients, including a closer look to hip fracture patients, and determine how epidemiological variables may have influenced on a higher vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the basis for the considerations needed to reintroduce elective surgery during the pandemic., DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective cohort study., SETTING: Level I Trauma Center in the East of Spain., PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 144 consecutive fracture patients 18 years or older admitted for surgery., INTERVENTION: Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with either molecular and/or serological techniques and screened for presentation of COVID-19., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Patients were interviewed and charts reviewed for demographic, epidemiological, clinical and surgical characteristics., RESULTS: We interviewed all patients and tested 137 (95.7%) of them. Three positive patients for SARS-CoV-2 were identified (2.1%). One was asymptomatic and the other two required admission due to COVID-19 related symptoms. Mortality for the whole cohort was 13 patients (9%). Significant association was found between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and epidemiological variables including: intimate exposure to respiratory symptomatic patients (p=0.025) and intimate exposure to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (p=0.013). No association was found when crowding above 50 people was tested individually (p=0.187). When comparing the 2020 and 2019 hip fracture cohorts we found them to be similar, including 30-day mortality. A significant increase in surgical delay from 1.5 to 1.8 days was observed on the 2020 patients (p=0.034)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients may be treated safely at hospitals if strict recommendations are followed. Both cohorts of hip fracture patients had similar 30-day mortality., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.	false
0	Systematic review with meta-analysis: liver manifestations and outcomes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the presence of the pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) have been variably reported in COVID-19., AIMS: To assess the prevalence of CLD, the incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the outcomes of patients with and without underlying CLD/elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19., METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases from 1 December 2019 to 24 April 2020 was done. We included studies reporting underlying CLD or elevated liver chemistries and patient outcomes in COVID-19., RESULTS: 107 articles (n = 20 874 patients) were included for the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of underlying CLD was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) among the 15 407 COVID-19 patients. The pooled incidence of elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19 was 23.1% (19.3-27.3) at initial presentation. Additionally, 24.4% (13.5-40) developed elevated liver chemistries during the illness. The pooled incidence of drug-induced liver injury was 25.4% (14.2-41.4). The pooled prevalence of CLD among 1587 severely infected patients was 3.9% (3%-5.2%). The odds of developing severe COVID-19 in CLD patients was 0.81 (0.31-2.09; P = 0.67) compared to non-CLD patients. COVID-19 patients with elevated liver chemistries had increased risk of mortality (OR-3.46 [2.42-4.95, P < 0.001]) and severe disease (OR-2.87 [95% CI, 2.29-3.6, P < 0.001]) compared to patients without elevated liver chemistries., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated liver chemistries are common at presentation and during COVID-19. The severity of elevated liver chemistries determines the outcome of COVID-19. The presence of CLD does not alter the outcome of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to analyse the outcomes of compensated and decompensated liver disease. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.	false
0	Mood, anxiety and olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19: evidence of central nervous system involvement?. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the burden of depressed mood and anxiety in COVID-19, and associated disease characteristics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed using RT-PCR-based testing over a 6-week period. The 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants' baseline, pre-COVID-19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID-19 were assessed., RESULTS: PHQ-2 and GAD-2 significantly (p<0.001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ-2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=1.40, 95%CI: 1.10-1.78, p=0.006), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.006), and baseline PHQ-2 score (aIRR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.09-1.76, p=0.007). GAD-2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.02-1.62, p=0.035), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.025) and baseline GAD-2 score (aIRR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.24-1.93, p<0.001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and GAD-2. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID-19 course., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of symptoms-such as SOB-associated with severe manifestations of COVID-19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were associated with depressed mood and anxiety. These results may raise the novel possibility of emotional disturbance as a CNS manifestation of COVID-19 given trans-olfactory tract penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) by coronaviruses.

0	A Comparison Between Chinese Children Infected with Coronavirus Disease-2019 and with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2003. Objectives: To compare the clinical and laboratory features of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2003 (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2 Chinese pediatric cohorts, given that the causative pathogens and are biologically similar. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study reviewing pediatric patients with SARS (n = 43) and COVID-19 (n = 244) who were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong and Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, respectively. Demographics, hospital length of stay, and clinical and laboratory features were compared. Result(s): Overall, 97.7% of patients with SARS and 85.2% of patients with COVID-19 had epidemiologic associations with known cases. Significantly more patients with SARS developed fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, coryza, sore throat, sputum production, nausea, headache, and dizziness than patients with COVID-19. No patients with SARS were asymptomatic at the time of admission, whereas 29.1% and 20.9% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic on admission and throughout their hospital stay, respectively. More patients with SARS required oxygen supplementation than patients with COVID-19 (18.6 vs 4.7%; P = .004). Only 1.6% of patients with COVID-19 and 2.3% of patients with SARS required mechanical ventilation. Leukopenia (37.2% vs 18.6%; P = .008), lymphopenia (95.4% vs 32.6%; P < .01), and thrombocytopenia (41.9% vs 3.8%; P < .001) were significantly more common in patients with SARS than in patients with COVID-19. The duration between positive and negative nasopharyngeal aspirate and the length in hospital stay were similar in patients with COVID-19, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic or symptomatic, suggesting a similar duration of viral shedding. Conclusion(s): Children with COVID-19 were less symptomatic and had more favorable hematologic findings than children with SARS.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Coronavirus Disease of 2019: a Mimicker of Dengue Infection?. At the beginning of 2020, the national health system and medical communities are faced with unprecedented public health challenges. A novel strain of coronavirus, later identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, marking another pandemic of coronaviruses. This viral disease is responsible for devastating pneumonia, named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and projected to persist until the end of the year. In tropical countries, however, concerns arise regarding the similarities of COVID-19 with other infectious diseases due to the same chief complaint, which is fever. One of the infectious disease of a primary concern is dengue infection, which its peak season is approaching. Others report that there are cases of serological cross-reaction of COVID-19 and dengue infection. In this comprehensive review, we underscore the importance of knowing similar clinical presentations of both diseases and emphasize why excluding COVID-19 in the differentials in the setting of a pandemic is imprudent.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	false
0	Coronavirus antibody positive tests and continued use of personal protective equipment throughout the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust not only a novel virus onto the world, but new challenges resulting in novel approaches. Governments have reduced regulation in order to facilitate timely advances to combat the disease. Antibody testing has rapidly been deployed but it is creating challenges for staff and patients. Mask use has come to the forefront and human factor (HF) strategies must be examined to reduce risk associated with lack of engagement from both healthcare staff and patients. In this we explore these issues and suggest some solutions. Copyright © 2020 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. All rights reserved.	false

0	The role of human serum and solution chemistry in fibrinogen peptide-nanoparticle interactions. In living systems, the biomolecules that coat nanoparticles (NPs) alter the NP biological identity and response. Although some biomolecules are more effective in mediating NP stability or biological fate, it is difficult to monitor an individual biomolecule within the complexity of the biota. To understand the dependence of protein-NP interactions on common variations in blood, we have evaluated binding between silica NPs and a model gamma-fibrinogen (GF) peptide. Fibrinogen is commonly identified within the protein corona fingerprint of human serum, but its abundance on the NP varies. To assess the relative importance of human serum and solution conditions, GF peptide and silica NP interactions were evaluated with and without serum across various pH, NaCl concentrations, and glucose concentrations. Initial evaluation of the GF peptide and silica NP complexes using circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering show little change in the secondary structure of the peptide and no significant agglomeration of NPs, suggesting peptide-NP complexes are stable across study conditions. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to monitor GF peptide-NP binding. Both with and without serum, binding constants for the gamma-fibrinogen peptide vary significantly upon addition of diluted HS (1 : 500) and 29 mM sodium chloride. Yet, results indicated that gamma-fibrinogen binding interactions with silica NPs are comparatively insensitive to physiologically relevant pH changes and dramatic increases in glucose concentrations. Results highlight the importance of blood chemistries, which vary across individuals and disease states, in mediating protein corona formation.	false
0	Acute Kidney Injury by SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with COVID-19: an integrative review. OBJECTIVE: to assess scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 Acute Kidney Injury in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: an integrative review, with adoption of PICO strategy and classification of the level of evidence, carried out on April 10, 2020 in the PubMed database, of articles available between December 2019 and April 2020., RESULTS: the sample consisted of six original, five observational and one experimental articles. Observational studies addressed the clinical findings of patients with COVID-19 and association between kidney damage, infection, and morbidity-mortality., CONCLUSION: the studies addressed the mechanism of intracellular infection of SARS-CoV-2, its cytopathic effects on kidney cells and incidence of acute kidney injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Acute kidney injury is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in these patients. This review realizes the need for new research that can mention kidney care to patients with COVID-19.	false
0	Clinical Characteristics of Children with COVID-19. Background: In December 2019, the infection caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) led to an outbreak in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei Province of China. Following this, there has been a rapid increase in the number of cases. On 12th March 2020, there were over 100,000 confirmed cases and almost 4,300 deaths worldwide. The clinical profile of children with COVID-19 is unknown due to the few number of cases reported. Currently, available data suggest they may have a milder form of illness., Methods: A review of the literature published from June 2019 to March 2020 was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of COVID-19 in in children. Data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, ISI Web of Knowledge and references within identified articles., Results: We identified 303 potential studies, and 295 were excluded for reasons including duplicates, experimental studies and case reports. Eight studies were eligible for inclusion, including a total of 820 paediatric cases of COVID-19. Asymptomatic cases represented 14.3% (n = 117) of the total number of cases identified, and thus the remaining 85.7% (n = 703) experienced symptoms. Fever was the commonest symptom in 53.9% (n = 48) of cases, followed by cough in 39.3% (n = 35) of cases, and rhinorrhoea or pharyngeal congestion in 13.5% (n = 12) of cases. Diarrhoea and sore throats were less common symptoms, 7.9% (n = 7) and 9.0% (n = 8) respectively. Other symptoms, including fatigue, headache and dizziness were rare., Conclusion: Children are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and are more likely to run a milder cause of illness following this infection compared to adults. This outbreak only started 3 months ago, therefore, further population wide studies are needed to validate these findings. Copyright © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.	false
0	"""Small"" Intestinal Immunopathology Plays a ""Big"" Role in Lethal Cytokine Release Syndrome, and Its Modulation by Interferon-gamma, IL-17A, and a Janus Kinase Inhibitor. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy, administration of certain T cell-agonistic antibodies, immune check point inhibitors, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by streptococcal as well as staphylococcal superantigens share one common complication, that is T cell-driven cytokine release syndrome (CRS) accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). It is not understood whether the failure of a particular organ contributes more significantly to the severity of CRS. Also not known is whether a specific cytokine or signaling pathway plays a more pathogenic role in precipitating MOD compared to others. As a result, there is no specific treatment available to date for CRS, and it is managed only symptomatically to support the deteriorating organ functions and maintain the blood pressure. Therefore, we used the superantigen-induced CRS model in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice, that closely mimics human CRS, to delineate the immunopathogenesis of CRS as well as to validate a novel treatment for CRS. Using this model, we demonstrate that (i) CRS is characterized by a rapid rise in systemic levels of several Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 type cytokines within a few hours, followed by a quick decline. (ii) Even though multiple organs are affected, small intestinal immunopathology is the major contributor to mortality in CRS. (iii) IFN-gamma deficiency significantly protected from lethal CRS by attenuating small bowel pathology, whereas IL-17A deficiency significantly increased mortality by augmenting small bowel pathology. (iv) RNA sequencing of small intestinal tissues indicated that IFN-gamma-STAT1-driven inflammatory pathways combined with enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic molecules as well as extracellular matrix degradation contributed to small bowel pathology in CRS. These pathways were further enhanced by IL-17A deficiency and significantly down-regulated in mice lacking IFN-gamma. (v) Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK-1/2 inhibitor, attenuated SAg-induced T cell activation, cytokine production, and small bowel pathology, thereby completely protecting from lethal CRS in both WT and IL-17A deficient HLA-DR3 mice. Overall, IFN-gamma-JAK-STAT-driven pathways contribute to lethal small intestinal immunopathology in T cell-driven CRS.

0	The efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease, which is pandemic, infectious, and high mortality. Many commonly discussed medications being used to treat COVID-19 are not without potentially harmful side effects such as heart, liver, kidney problems, or other clinical symptoms. Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological method. When a needle is inserted into an acupuncture point, traumatic physical stimulation occurs, and then the neuroendocrine immune regulation network is activated. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments., METHODS: From their inception to December 10, 2020, the following electronic databases will be searched to identify relevant studies: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), without any language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials and credible clinical observations without randomization include patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and receiving western medicine treatments or acupuncture, with no restrictions on disease stage, age, sex, or ethnicity. Primary outcomes would be used to evaluate the mortality rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine, troponin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), blood pressure, clinical symptoms (including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and serum cytokine levels. Secondary outcome would be used to evaluate the adverse events of acupuncture. Risk of bias will be assessed by 2 review authors independently according to the guidelines set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions., DISCUSSION: This is the first to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments. A longer follow-up should be considered in future studies., CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis would provide evidence of acupuncture specifically focused on its effectiveness and safety for patients with COVID-19 western medications adverse effects., REGISTRATION: Registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020189494).	false
0	Asymptomatic COVID-19 or are we missing something?. The Northern Territory (NT) Centre for Disease Control (CDC) undertook contact tracing of all notified cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the Territory. There were 28 cases of COVID-19 notified in the NT between 1 March and 30 April 2020. In total 527 people were identified as close contacts over the same period; 493 were successfully contacted; 445 were located in the NT and were subsequently quarantined and monitored for disease symptoms daily for 14 days after contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Of these 445 close contacts, 4 tested positive for COVID-19 after developing symptoms; 2/46 contacts who were cruise ship passengers (4.3%, 95% CI 0.5-14.8%) and 2/51 household contacts (3.9%, 95% CI 0.5-13.5%). None of the 326 aircraft passengers or 4 healthcare workers who were being monitored in the NT as close contacts became cases. Copyright © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.	false
0	COVID-19 and the Chemical Senses: Supporting Players Take Center Stage. The main neurological manifestation of COVID-19 is loss of smell or taste. The high incidence of smell loss without significant rhinorrhea or nasal congestion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 targets the chemical senses through mechanisms distinct from those used by endemic coronaviruses or other common cold-causing agents. Here we review recently developed hypotheses about how SARS-CoV-2 might alter the cells and circuits involved in chemosensory processing and thereby change perception. Given our limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we propose future experiments to elucidate disease mechanisms and highlight the relevance of this ongoing work to understanding how the virus might alter brain function more broadly.

0	A retrospective analysis of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics of familial cluster-onset COVID-19. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus has a high incidence rate and strong infectivity. The diagnosis and evaluation of familial outbreaks requires a collective consideration of epidemiological history, molecular detection methods, chest computed tomography (CT), and clinical symptoms., Methods: A group of family patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in Guizhou, China, in February 2020, was retrospectively analyzed. As of March 1, all patients in the group have been discharged from hospital. This study tracked all patients in the group. We report the epidemiology, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of these patients., Results: We collected a group of 8 clustered cases (3 men and 5 women) from a family with confirmed COVID-19 infection. In the first admission diagnosis, according to the degree of clinical symptoms, the 8 patients were defined as mild type (4/8) or moderate type (4/8). They were also divided according to the CT findings into early period (1/8), progressive period (3/8), and negative on CT scan (4/8); for the first 4 patients, the corresponding CT image scores were 1, 4, 5, and 5 respectively. In this group of COVID-19 patients, half of the patients showed occult clinical manifestations and negative CT performance. We defined these patients as COVID-19-infected patients, or asymptomatic carriers., Conclusions: The family cluster analysis indicated that COVID-19-infected patients (asymptomatic carriers) and symptomatic COVID-19 patients are distinct but coexistent. This may indicate that the infectivity and virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has decreased. In order to block the transmission pathway of this virus before it spreads, we need to identify the presence of asymptomatic carriers as early as possible.

0	[Research progress on the clinical features and mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with liver injury]. The highly contagious novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) that broke out in December 2019 has brought huge threats and losses to human society, so it has been the concern of every countries government. Presently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19; however, a variety of potentially effective antiviral drugs, vaccines, cell therapies, traditional Chinese medicine and other methods are in clinical trials. Liver injury is a common complication of patients receiving COVID-19 treatment and its possible high incidence may affect the outcome of the disease. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 combined with liver injury in existing studies is still unclear, and relevant guidelines and expert consensuses are insufficient for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the relevant progress and issues are now reviewed here.	false
0	Lockdown measures and relative changes in the age-specific incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. BACKGROUND: The first months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain resulted in high incidence and mortality. A national sero-epidemiological survey suggests higher cumulative incidence of infection in older individuals than in younger individuals. However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups, including the relative effect of the lockdown measures introduced on March 15, and strengthened on March 30 to April 14, 2020 when only essential workers continued to work., METHODS: We used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE in Spanish) on the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (by date of symptom onset) in eleven 5-year age groups: 15-19y through 65-69y. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69y during the pre-lockdown period (March 1-10, 2020) and the corresponding proportion L(g) during two lockdown periods (March 25-April 3 and April 8-17, 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g)= L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period., RESULTS: For the first lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54y (PR=1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55-59y (PR=1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19y (PR=1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50-54y (PR=1.20; 1.09,1.31)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the first lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64y, particularly those aged 50-59y presented with higher COVID-19 relative incidence compared to pre-lockdown period, while younger adults/older adolescents (together with persons aged 50-59y) had increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown. The role of different age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future mitigation efforts.	false
0	Using Prenatal Blood Samples to Evaluate COVID-19 Rapid Serologic Tests Specificity. INTRODUCTION: Background cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses may reduce the specificity of COVID-19 rapid serologic tests. The vast majority of women attend prenatal care, which is a unique source of population-based blood samples appropriate for validation studies. We used stored 2018 serum samples from an existing pregnancy cohort study to evaluate the specificity of COVID-19 serologic rapid diagnostic tests., METHODS: We randomly selected 120 stored serum samples from pregnant women enrolled in a cohort in 2018 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, at least 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic. We used stored serum to evaluate four lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests, following manufacturers' instructions. Pictures were taken for all tests and read by two blinded trained evaluators., RESULTS: We evaluated 120, 80, 90, and 90 samples, respectively. Specificity for both IgM and IgG was 100% for the first two tests (95% confidence intervals [CI] 97.0-100 and 95.5-100, respectively). The third test had a specificity of 98.9% (95% CI 94.0-100) for IgM and 94.4% (95% CI 87.5-98.2) for IgG. The fourth test had a specificity of 88.9% (95% CI 80.5-94.5) for IgM and 100% (95% CI 96.0-100) for IgG., DISCUSSION: COVID-19 serologic rapid tests are of variable specificity. Blood specimens from sentinel prenatal clinics provide an opportunity to validate serologic tests with population-based samples.	false
0	Epidemiology, prognosis and clinical manifestation of cardiovascular disease in COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a pneumonia cluster in Wuhan, China. Since then, the contagion has rapidly spread all over the world resulting in a global pandemic. Since frequent cardiovascular (CV) system involvement has soon been detected in patients occurring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we would provide a simple review available to cardiologists who are going to be involved in the management of COVID-19 patients from several levels: from diagnosis to prevention and management of CV complications., AREAS COVERED: We investigate the role of CV diseases in COVID-19: from incidence of CV comorbidities to their negative impact on prognosis. We also search Literature in order to identify the main CV manifestations in patients occurring virus infection and their management by cardiologists., EXPERT OPINION: Specific treatments for CV involvement associated with COVID-19 are still debated. Results from ongoing trials are needed to further clarify issues about the therapeutic approach, which is constantly changing according the continuous flow of published evidences. Finally, it seems necessary to sensitize all population to raise awareness on CV diseases in COVID era, to hinder underestimation of both new-onset acute CV diseases and consequences of chronic mistreated CV diseases.	false
0	[The impact of Covid-19 pandemic on breastfeeding and birth care. The importance of recovering good practices.]. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a major impact on birth care and lactation. The lack of knowledge regarding the transmission mechanisms and the potential risks for the mother and the newborn, even when the vertical transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated, has led to the abandonment of practices such as skin-to-skin and the early initiation of breastfeeding (BF), which offer great benefits for maternal and child health. Taking into account the available scientific evidence and the protective effect of BF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other organisms recommend, in cases of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mother, maintaining mother-child contact and BF, adopting preventive measure procedures to minimize the risk of contagion. These measures include hand hygiene, before and after contact with the newborn and the use of a mask. If a temporary separation of mother and child is required, it is recommended to feed the newborn with expressed breast milk. The presence of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in the milk of infected women, so BF could reduce the clinical impact of the disease in the infant, if it becomes infected.	false
0	Accounting for symptomatic and asymptomatic in a SEIR-type model of COVID-19. A mathematical model was developed describing the dynamic of the COVID-19 virus over a population considering that the infected can either be symptomatic or not. The model was calibrated using data on the confirmed cases and death from several countries like France, Philippines, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, China, and the USA. First, we derived the basic reproduction number,R(0)R0, and estimated the effective reproductionR(eff)Refffor each country. Second, we were interested in the merits of interventions, either by distancing or by treatment. Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission. However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for France). By setting the end of containment as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.	false

BACKGROUND: In women of reproductive age, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) constitutes the most frequent endocrine disorder. Women with PCOS are considered to typically belong to an age and sex group which is at lower risk for severe COVID-19., MAIN BODY: Emerging data link the risk of severe COVID-19 with certain factors such as hyper-inflammation, ethnicity predisposition, low vitamin D levels, and hyperandrogenism, all of which have known direct associations with PCOS. Moreover, in this common female patient population, there is markedly high prevalence of multiple cardio-metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, which may significantly increase the risk for adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. This strong overlap of risk factors for both worse PCOS cardio-metabolic manifestations and severe COVID-19 should be highlighted for the clinical practice, particularly since women with PCOS often receive fragmented care from multiple healthcare services. Comprehensively informing women with PCOS regarding the potential risks from COVID-19 and how this may affect their management is also essential., CONCLUSION: Despite the immense challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak to the healthcare systems in affected countries, attention should be directed to maintain a high standard of care for complex patients such as many women with PCOS and provide relevant practical recommendations for optimal management in the setting of this fast moving pandemic.	false
0	Management of Idiopathic CNS inflammatory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives and strategies for continuity of care from a South East Asian Center with limited resources. The Covid-19 pandemic poses a grave health management challenge globally of unprecedented nature. Management of idiopathic Central Nervous system inflammatory disorders (iCNSID) such as Multiple sclerosis, Neuromyelitis optica and its spectrum disorders and related conditions during this pandemic needs to be addressed with affirmative and sustainable strategies in order to prevent disease related risks, medication related complications and possible COVID-19 disease associated effects. Global international iCNSIDs agencies and recent publications are attempting to address this but such guidance is not available in South East Asia. Here we outline prospectively qualitatively and quantitatively novel strategies at a tertiary center in Malaysia catering for neuroimmunological disorders despite modest resources during this pandemic. In this retrospective study with longitudinal follow-up, we describe stratification of patients for face to face versus virtual visits in the absence of formal teleneurology, stratification of patients for treatment according to disease activity, rescheduling, deferring initiation or extending treatment intervals of certain disease modifying therapies(DMT's) or immunosuppressants(IS), especially those producing lymphocyte depletion in MS and the continuation of IS in patients with NMO/NMOSD. Furthermore, we highlight the use off-label treatments such as Intravenous immunoglobulins/rituximab,bridging interferons/Teriflunomide temporarily replacing more potent DMT choices,supply challenges of IS/DMT's and tailoring blood watches and neuroimaging surveillance based on the current health needs to stave off the pandemic and prevent at risk patients with iCNSID/health care workers from possibly being exposed to the COVID-19.

0	An update on antiviral antibody-based biopharmaceuticals. Due to the vastness of the science virology, it is no longer an offshoot solely of the microbiology. Viruses have become as the causative agents of major epidemics throughout history. Many therapeutic strategies have been used for these microorganisms, and in this way the recognizing of potential targets of viruses is of particular importance for success. For decades, antibodies and antibody fragments have occupied a significant body of the treatment approaches against infectious diseases. Because of their high affinity, they can be designed and engineered against a variety of purposes, mainly since antibody fragments such as scFv, nanobody, diabody, and bispecific antibody have emerged owing to their small size and interesting properties. In this review, we have discussed the antibody discovery and molecular and biological design of antibody fragments as inspiring therapeutic and diagnostic agents against viral targets.

0	Mental health of orthopaedic trauma patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with reports of increased anxiety, depression and fear among the general population. People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification., RESULTS: The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019. Stress induced by the coronavirus pandemic can place patients with mental illness at a higher risk for perilous behaviours and subsequent fractures.	false
0	The effect of diabetes on mortality of COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a very serious and urgent infectious disease. With the development of global economy and the improvement of living standard, the incidence of diabetes is increasing year by year. And it is more common in the elderly. COVID-19 is associated with much chronic disease, especially diabetes. At present, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality based on large scale of data between diabetes and COVID-19 all over the world., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and VIP were searched by computer, and the researches related to diabetes mellitus and mortality of COVID-19 were collected. The searching time was from the establishment of the database to April 30 2020. The meta-analysis was carried out by Review Manager Version 5.3 and stata 14.0 software for Mac software after 2 researchers independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the bias risk. The main outcome was the mortality of COVID-19 which was included in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. The bias of the study was evaluated independently by NOS scale, and published by funnel chart. The sensitivity was analyzed row by row., RESULTS: The results will be published at a peer-reviewed journal.Registration number: INPLASY202040158.	false
0	Acupuncture for breathlessness in COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.

Finally, a meta-analysis will be used to evaluate the pooled intervention effect if possible., RESULTS: Our present findings will indicate the application of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for dyspnea in COVID-19, which will be published in a peer-reviewed journal., CONCLUSION: Our study will provide a reference foundation for clinical optimization of treatment., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020182323.	false
0	Serum Iron Level as a Potential Predictor of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Severity and Mortality: A Retrospective Study. Background: Various types of pulmonary diseases are associated with iron deficiency. However, information on iron status in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce., Methods: This study included 50 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The role of serum iron in predicting severity and mortality of COVID-19 was evaluated., Results: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 patients in this study were cough (82%), fever (64%), and chest distress (42%). Of the 50 patients, 45 (90%) patients had abnormally low serum iron levels (<7.8 mumol/L). The severity of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with serum iron levels before and after treatment and was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, urea nitrogen, and myoglobin levels. Decreased serum iron level could predict the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe and critical illness. Seven (53.8%) patients with a lower serum iron level after treatment in the critical group had died. There was a significant difference in posttreatment serum iron levels between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors., Conclusions: Serum iron deficiency was detected in the patients with COVID-19. The severity and mortality of the disease was closely correlated with serum iron levels. Low serum iron concentration was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients.

0	Leucocyte Subsets Effectively Predict the Clinical Outcome of Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Case-Control Study. Background: The clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been well-studied, while effective predictors for clinical outcome and research on underlying mechanisms are scarce. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients with definitive clinical outcome (cured or died) were retrospectively studied. The diagnostic performance of the leucocyte subsets and other parameters were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Further, the correlations between leucocyte subsets and inflammation-related factors associated with clinical outcome were subsequently investigated. Results: Among 95 subjects included, 56 patients were cured, and 39 died. Older age, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, D-dimer, Procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein levels, decreased albumin, elevated serum cytokines (IL2R, IL6, IL8, IL10, and TNF-alpha) levels, and a decreased lymphocyte count indicated poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Lymphocyte subset (lymphocytes, T cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, natural killer cells, T cells+B cells+NK cells) counts were positively associated with clinical outcome (AUC: 0.777; AUC: 0.925; AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.902; AUC: 0.877; AUC: 0.918, resp.). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to T lymphocyte count ratio (NTR), neutrophil percentage to T lymphocyte ratio (NpTR) effectively predicted mortality (AUC: 0.900; AUC: 0.905; AUC: 0.932, resp.). Binary logistic regression showed that NpTR was an independent prognostic factor for mortality. Serum IL6 levels were positively correlated with leucocyte count, neutrophil count, and eosinophil count and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count. Conclusion:  These results indicate that leucocyte subsets predict the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with high efficiency. Non-self-limiting inflammatory response is involved in the development of fatal pneumonia. Copyright © 2020 Gan, Li, Li and Yang.	false
0	Immunopathology and immunotherapeutic strategies in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major concern globally. As of 14 April 2020, more than 1.9 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 185 countries. Some patients with COVID-19 develop severe clinical manifestations, while others show mild symptoms, suggesting that dysregulation of the host immune response contributes to disease progression and severity. In this review, we have summarized and discussed recent immunological studies focusing on the response of the host immune system and the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as immunotherapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2, functional exhaustion of lymphocytes, and cytokine storm have been discussed as part of immunopathology mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some potential immunotherapeutic strategies to control the progression of COVID-19, such as passive antibody therapy and use of interferon alphabeta and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibitor, have also been discussed. This may help us to understand the immune status of patients with COVID-19, particularly those with severe clinical presentation, and form a basis for further immunotherapeutic investigations.

0	Prevalence of COVID-19-like symptoms among people living with HIV, and using antiretroviral therapy for prevention and treatment. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread globally with remarkable speed, and currently, there is limited data available exploring any aspect of the intersection between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection., OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Tehran, Iran., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., METHODS: A total of 200 PLWH were recruited through the positive club via sampling, and completed the symptom-based questionnaire for COVID-19, which was delivered by trained peers., RESULTS: Of 200 participants, respiratory symptoms, including cough, sputum, and shortness of breath were the most prevalent among participants, but only one person developed symptoms collectively suggested COVID-19 and sought treatments., CONCLUSIONS: It appears that existing infection with HIV or receiving ART might reduce the susceptibility to the infection with SARS-CoV-2 or decrease the severity of the infection acquired. Further research is needed to understand causal mechanisms. Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.	false
0	COVID-19: Progress in diagnostics, therapy and vaccination. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently become a pandemic. As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus?s spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	The European response to the WHO call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. The age-standardised incidence of cervical cancer in Europe varies widely (between 3 and 25/100000 women-years) in 2018. HPV vaccine coverage is low in countries with the highest incidence and screening performance is heterogeneous among European countries. A broad group of delegates of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations endorse the principles of the WHO call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, also in Europe. All European nations should, by 2030, reach at least 90% HPV vaccine coverage among girls by the age of 15 years and also boys, if cost-effective; they should introduce organised population-based HPV-based screening and achieve 70% of screening coverage in the target age group, providing also HPV testing on self-samples for non- or under-screened women; and to manage 90% of screen-positive women. To guide member states, a group of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations engage to assist in the roll-out of a series of concerted evidence-based actions. European health authorities are requested to mandate a group of experts to develop the third edition of European Guidelines for Quality Assurance of Cervical Cancer prevention based on integrated HPV vaccination and screening and to monitor the progress towards the elimination goal. The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, having interrupted prevention activities temporarily, should not deviate stakeholders from this ambition. In the immediate post-epidemic phase, health professionals should focus on high-risk women and adhere to cost-effective policies including self-sampling. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Long-term infection of SARS-CoV-2 changed the body's immune status. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, a disease called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic worldwide. To investigate the immune responses after infection of SARS-CoV-2 in non-critical patients may help to better understand the disease progression. We collected 334 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 212 still in hospital with nucleic acid test positive on halfway for SARS-CoV-2 and 122 discharged from hospital, compared specific antibodies, immune cells, and cytokine changes between the hospitalized and discharged patients. The hospitalized patients had a longer illness time compared with discharged patients. Analysis of viral loads explained long-term or persistent infection of SARS-CoV-2, which existed with the median time of 18.5days of the positive nucleic acid test. Serum analysis showed that the specific anti-N IgG antibody was positive in all detected patients after infection of two weeks. Neutrophils, Monocytes, NK cells, and CD4+ T cells significantly increased, while total lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells decreased from non-critical hospitalized patients after longer-term infection. Further analysis of the cytokines showed that IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 from the hospitalized patients were significantly higher, indicating a potential of the increased CD4+ T cell differentiation.

0	Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 - Preliminary Report. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death., METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison., RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

0	Covid-19 related IgA vasculitis. IgA vasculitis is a systemic small-vessel vasculitis which may be triggered by different microorganisms. IgA vasculitis cases have been reported in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders treated with TNF inhibitors. Here we report the case of a young Crohn's disease patient in clinical remission under adalimumab admitted for an IgA vasculitis, with an extended ileitis, and a positive PCR testing for Covid-19. Serum IgA levels were markedly increased and serology for Covid-19 was weakly positive for IgA. Even if we cannot prove the causality of Covid-19, it is remarkable to note that this case of IgA vasculitis was associated with high IgA levels in the serum and the Covid-19 serology was positive only for IgA.

However, the mechanism of the disease, including some of the symptoms such as the neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms, is still poorly understood. Objective: The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence on the neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms of the disease. This may help with early diagnosis, prevention of disease spread, and treatment planning. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (first 100 hits) were searched until April 17, 2020. The key search terms used were ""coronavirus"" and ""signs and symptoms."" Only studies written in English were included. Study Selection: The selection was performed by two independent reviewers using EndNote and Rayyan software. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were followed for abstracting data and assessing the quality of the studies. These were carried out by two and three independent reviewers, respectively. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. The data were analyzed using qualitative synthesis and pooled using a random-effect model. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The outcomes in the study include country, study design, participant details (sex, age, sample size), and neurological and musculoskeletal features. Result: Sixty studies (n = 11, 069) were included in the review, and 51 studies were used in the meta-analysis. The median or mean age ranged from 24 to 95 years. The prevalence of neurological and musculoskeletal manifestations was 35% for smell impairment (95% CI 0-94%; I 2 99.63%), 33% for taste impairment (95% CI 0-91%; I 2 99.58%), 19% for myalgia (95% CI 16-23; I 2 95%), 12% for headache (95% CI 9-15; I 2 93.12%), 10% for back pain (95% CI 1-23%; I 2 80.20%), 10% for dizziness (95% CI 3-19%; I 2 86.74%), 3% for acute cerebrovascular disease (95% CI 1-5%; I 2 0%), and 2% for impaired consciousness (95% CI 1-2%; I 2 0%). Conclusion and Relevance: Patients with COVID-19 present with neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms. Therefore, clinicians need to be vigilant in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

0	A synergistic role of convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients: a clinical case report. Acute respiratory distress syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, which causes global public health emergencies, has sped widely for more than 5 months and has the risk of long-term transmission. No effective treatment has been discovered to date. In the cases we report, the patient continued to deteriorate even after administration of antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon-alpha, and ribavirin, as well as intravenous injection of meropenem, methylprednisolone, and immunoglobulin. So, we infused the patient with convalescent plasma (CP), and the absolute lymphocyte count increased the next day and returned to normal on the fourth day. Followed by intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), bilateral infiltrates were absorbed and the pulmonary function was significantly improved. We note that the intravenous infusion of CP and MSCs for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients may have synergistic characteristics in inhibiting cytokine storm, promoting the repair of lung injury, and recovering pulmonary function. We hope to provide a reference for the research direction of COVID-19 clinical strategies.	false
0	Correlation analysis between disease severity and clinical and biochemical characteristics of 143 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan and has quickly spread across the world. The mortality rate in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is high. This study analyzed clinical and biochemical parameters between mild and severe patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early., METHODS: In this single center, cross-sectional study, 143 patients were included and divided to mild/moderate and sever/critical groups. Correlation between the disease criticality and clinical features and peripheral blood biochemical markers was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve., RESULTS: Significantly, disease severity was associated with age (r = 0.458, P < 0.001), comorbidities (r = 0.445, P < 0.001), white cell count (r = 0.229, P = 0.006), neutrophil count (r = 0.238, P = 0.004), lymphocyte count (r = - 0.295, P < 0.001), albumin (r = - 0.603, P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = - 0.362, P < 0.001), serum potassium (r = - 0.237, P = 0.004), plasma glucose (r = 0.383, P < 0.001), total bilirubin (r = 0.340, P < 0.001), serum amyloid A (r = 0.58, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.345, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.477, P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.548, P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.342, P < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.264, P = 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.284, P = 0.001) and D-dimer (r = 0.477, P < 0.001) ., CONCLUSIONS: With the following parameters such as age > 52 years, C-reactive protein > 64.79 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase > 245 U/L, D-dimer > 0.96 mug/mL, serum amyloid A > 100.02 mg/L, or albumin < 36 g/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented. Lymphocyte count, serum potassium, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and procalcitonin may also be a prognostic indicator.	false
0	Novel multiple swab method enables high efficiency in SARS-CoV-2 screenings without loss of sensitivity for screening of a complete population. BACKGROUND: In the pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR is one of the pillars on which countermeasures are based. Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in low-probability settings is proposed, but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput NAT analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for SARS-COV-2., METHODS: We evaluated a new approach of a multiple swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. Analytical sensitivity was constant up to a total number of 50 swabs. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (five-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (ten-sample pools)., RESULTS: The novel method did not cause false negative results with non-significantly differing Ct values between single swab and multiple swab NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified., CONCLUSIONS: The new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly. The multiple swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently. Secondly the example in Germany shows that blood transfusion services can support general health systems with their experience in NAT and their high throughput instruments. Screening of a huge number of inhabitants is currently the only option to prevent a second infection wave and enable exit strategies in many countries. This article is protected by copyright.

0	Rapidly fatal outcome of Covid-19 after successful emergency surgery during pandemic outbreak in Northern Italy. INTRODUCTION: A pandemic outbreak of novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 and responsible of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread from China to Europe, being Northern Italy the first focus outside Asia. Little is known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing surgery., PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we report the first confirmed case of early postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient recovering after Hartmann's procedure for acute diverticulitis. After an otherwise unevenful postoperative course, on post-operative day 8, the patient suddenly presented hyperpyrexia and cough, rapidly evolving to respiratory failure and death 36 h after symptoms onset. CT-scan identified bilateral, diffuse, interstitial pneumonitis and oropharyngeal swab test confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A previous contact with the partner, developing the same symptoms, remained unrecognized until ICU admission., DISCUSSION: During a pandemic outbreak, the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an inside patient initially considered to be infection-free has a pivotal importance not only for the prompt patient's management, but also to avoid infection spreading to other patients and hospital personnel. In the reported case, a more precise information to the patient regarding the imperative necessity to inform the medical personnel of any person of his entourage presenting, at any time, any tell-tale sign, symptom or examination which may be attributed to COVID-19, may have had allowed to anticipate patient's isolation and examinations and procedures aimed at identifying such an infection., CONCLUSION: Persistent hyperleucocytosis and increased CRP serum level in spite of uneventful postoperative course were the only, aspecific markers of an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection before symptoms' onset, and should be considered in future clinical practice in order to adopt the prompt and appropriate patient management and limit COVID-19 contagion in surgical units.

0	Functional and cognitive outcomes after COVID-19 delirium. PURPOSE: To ascertain delirium prevalence and outcomes in COVID-19., METHODS: We conducted a point-prevalence study in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients at University College Hospital. Delirium was defined by DSM-IV criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 4 weeks; secondary outcomes were physical and cognitive function., RESULTS: In 71 patients (mean age 61, 75% men), 31 (42%) had delirium, of which only 12 (39%) had been recognised by the clinical team. At 4 weeks, 20 (28%) had died, 26 (36%) were interviewed by telephone and 21 (30%) remained as inpatients. Physical function was substantially worse in people after delirium - 50 out of 166 points (95% CI - 83 to - 17, p = 0.01). Mean cognitive scores at follow-up were similar and delirium was not associated with mortality in this sample., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that delirium is common, yet under-recognised. Delirium is associated with functional impairments in the medium term.	false
0	Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Laboratory Utilization. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was formally characterized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since that time, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demand for healthcare resources. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in laboratory test utilization in the setting of increasing local incidence of COVID-19., METHODS: We performed a retrospective assessment of laboratory test order and specimen container utilization at a single, urban tertiary care medical center. Data were extracted from the laboratory information system database over a 10-week period, spanning the primordial inflection of COVID-19 incidence in our region. Total testing volumes were calculated during the first and last two-weeks of the observation period and used as reference points to examine the absolute and relative differences in test order volume between the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 surge periods., RESULTS: Between February 2, 2020 and April 11, 2020, there were 873,397 tests ordered and final verified. The in-house SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate for admitted patients in the last week of the observation period was 30.8%. Significant increases in workload were observed in the send-out laboratory section and for COVID-19 diagnosis (PCR) and management-related testing. Otherwise, there was a net decrease in overall demand across nearly all laboratory sections. Increases in testing were noted for tests related to COVID-19 management. Viral transport media and citrated blue top containers demonstrated increases in utilization., CONCLUSION: Increasing local incidence of COVID-19 had a profound impact on laboratory operations. While volume increases were seen for laboratory tests related to COVID-19 diagnostics and management, including some with limited evidence to support their use, overall testing volumes decreased substantially. During events such as COVID-19, monitoring of such patterns can help inform laboratory management, staffing, and test stewardship recommendations for managing resource and supply availability.

0	Acute Kidney Injury and Special Considerations during Renal Replacement Therapy in Children with Coronavirus Disease-19: Perspective from the Critical Care Nephrology Section of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care. Children seem to be less severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as compared to adults. Little is known about the prevalence and pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children affected by SARS-CoV-2. Dehydration seems to be the most common trigger factor, and meticulous attention to fluid status is imperative. The principles of initiation, prescription, and complications related to renal replacement therapy are the same for coronavirus disease (COVID) patients as for non-COVID patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains the most common modality of treatment. When to initiate and what modality to use are dependent on the available resources. Though children are less often and less severely affected, diversion of all hospital resources to manage the adult surge might lead to limited CRRT resources. We describe how these shortages might be mitigated. Where machines are limited, one CRRT machine can be used for multiple patients, providing a limited number of hours of CRRT per day. In this case, increased exchange rates can be used to compensate for the decreased duration of CRRT. If consumables are limited, lower doses of CRRT (15-20 mL/kg/h) for 24 h may be feasible. Hypercoagulability leading to frequent filter clotting is an important issue in these children. Increased doses of unfractionated heparin, combination of heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation, or combination of prostacyclin and heparin might be used. If infusion pumps to deliver anticoagulants are limited, the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin might be considered. Alternatively in children, acute peritoneal dialysis can successfully control both fluid and metabolic disturbances. Intermittent hemodialysis can also be used in patients who are hemodynamically stable. The keys to successfully managing pediatric AKI in a pandemic are flexible use of resources, good understanding of dialysis techniques, and teamwork. Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19: a primer for cardiologists. In the late autumn of 2019, a new potentially lethal human coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus has created a global health emergency and an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly variable. Most patients (~85%) develop no or mild symptoms, while others become seriously ill, some succumbing to disease-related complications. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, its transmission and the clinical and immunological features of COVID-19 are described. In addition, an overview is presented of the virological assays for detecting ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infections and the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection. Also discussed are the different approaches to developing a COVID-19 vaccine and the perspectives of treating COVID-19 with antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants/antithrombotics. Finally, the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are briefly touched upon. While there is still much to learn about SARS-CoV-2, the tremendous recent advances in biomedical technology and knowledge and the huge amount of research into COVID-19 raise the hope that a remedy for this disease will soon be found. COVID-19 will nonetheless have a lasting impact on human society.	false
0	Proteomics and informatics for understanding phases and identifying biomarkers in COVID-19 disease. The emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has necessitated the urgent development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Rapid research and development, on an international scale, has already generated assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host immunoglobulins. However, the complexities of COVID-19 are such that a fuller definition of patient status, trajectory, sequelae and responses to therapy is now required. There is accumulating evidence - from studies of both COVID-19 and the related disease SARS - that protein biomarkers could help to provide this definition. Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase) and the inflammatory response (e.g. C-reactive protein) have already been identified as possible predictors of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Proteomics technologies, with their ability to detect many proteins per analysis, have begun to extend these early findings. In order to be effective, proteomics strategies must include not only methods for comprehensive data acquisition (e.g. using mass spectrometry) but also informatics approaches via which to derive actionable information from large data-sets. Here we review applications of proteomics to COVID-19 and SARS, and outline how pipelines involving technologies such as artificial intelligence could be of value for research on these diseases.	false
0	Impact on hospital admission of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in an Italian Hospital. : The worldwide pandemic caused by the novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in a new and lethal disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence of COVID-19 has posed a great threat to people's health worldwide and many people who need cardiovascular care were afraid of hospital admission, also in geographic areas with a few number of cases. This document shows how the pandemic is impacting hospital admission and the care of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients. We analyzed the number of interventional cardiology procedures to treat ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in our catheterization laboratory, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a specific period.	false
0	A Universal Design of Betacoronavirus Vaccines against COVID-19, MERS, and SARS. Vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and previously emerging MERS/SARS caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10- to 100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development. The framework of immunogen design can be universally applied to other beta-CoV vaccines to counter emerging threats. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Recovery of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with tocilizumab: successful outcome in two critically ill patients. Background: Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 is a challenge for nowadays medical practice. Although there is no clarity in the principal mechanism of lung damage and ARDS development, it has been suggested that one of the main reasons of this pathology is the hyperactivation of the immune system, better known as cytokine storm syndrome. Tocilizumab has been proposed to treat COVID-19 severe cases associated to ARDS. Results & methodology: Here we present two successful cases of tocilizumab administration in two COVID-19 patients with prior administration of antiviral therapy (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir) with adequate response and resolution of ARDS, septic shock and severe pneumonia within the first 72 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case supports the usage of tocilizumab as an effective therapy in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome. Further studies should be done in order to assess its effectiveness and security.	false
0	 Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID‐19: a living systematic review.  Abstract - Background Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.  Objectives To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID‐19. Search methods We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID‐19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID‐19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 4 June 2020. Selection criteria We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID‐19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non‐randomised Studies ‐ of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) tool for controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non‐controlled NRSIs.  Main results This is the first living update of our review. We included 20 studies (1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs, 16 non‐controlled NRSIs) with 5443 participants, of whom 5211 received convalescent plasma, and identified a further 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due to study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID‐19  We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low‐certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; very low‐certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory support (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19), 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome.  Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID‐19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non‐controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable. The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow‐up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event.  Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13 studies, 201 participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201 participants) reported on adverse events of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence).  Serious adverse events (14 studies, 5201 participants)  Fourteen studies (5201 participants) reported on serious adverse events. The majority of participants were from one non‐controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited to the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion. This study included death as a serious adverse event; they reported 15 deaths, four of which they classified as potentially, probably or definitely related to transfusion. Other serious adverse events reported in all studies were predominantly allergic or respiratory in nature, including anaphylaxis, transfusion‐associated dyspnoea, and transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious adverse events. Authors' conclusions We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID‐19. For safety outcomes we also included non‐controlled NRSIs. There was limited information regarding adverse events. Of the controlled studies, none reported on this outcome in the control group. There is only very low‐certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID‐19.  While major efforts to conduct research on COVID‐19 are being made, problems with recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies are conceivable. The early termination of the first RCT investigating convalescent plasma, and the multitude of studies registered in the past months illustrate this. It is therefore necessary to critically assess the design of these registered studies, and well‐designed studies should be prioritised. Other considerations for these studies are the need to report outcomes for all study arms in the same way, and the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co‐interventions administered in all study arms.  There are 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are RCTs. This is the first living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. These updates may show different results to those reported here. Plain language summary Plasma from people who have recovered from COVID‐19 to treat individuals with COVID‐19 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by a newly recognised type of coronavirus. People infected with this virus may not show signs of the disease, others may develop symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat. In some people the infection is more severe and can cause breathing difficulties, leading to hospitalisation, admission to intensive care or death. Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment is available. People who have recovered from COVID‐19 develop natural defences to the disease in their blood (antibodies). Antibodies are found in part of the blood called plasma. Plasma from blood donated from recovered patients, which contains COVID‐19 antibodies, can be used to make two preparations. Firstly, convalescent plasma, which is plasma that contains these antibodies. Secondly, hyperimmune immunoglobulin, which is more concentrated, and therefore contains more antibodies. Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin have been used successfully to treat other respiratory viruses. These treatments (given by a drip or injection) are generally well‐tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur. What did we want to find? We wanted to know whether plasma from people who have recovered from COVID‐19 is an effective treatment for people with COVID‐19, and whether this treatment causes any unwanted effects. We are continually updating this review as more evidence becomes available. Our methods On 4 June 2020 we searched major medical databases for clinical studies on treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID‐19. Studies could be conducted anywhere in the world and include participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, with mild, moderate or severe COVID‐19. Key results We included 20 completed studies with 5443 participants; 5211 participants received convalescent plasma. We found one randomised controlled trial ((RCT) 103 participants; 52 participants received convalescent plasma). RCTs are clinical studies where people are randomly allocated to receive the treatment (intervention group) or to receive a different treatment or no treatment (control group). RCTs produce the best evidence. We found three controlled non‐randomised studies of interventions ((controlled NRSIs) 236 participants; 55 participants received convalescent plasma). These controlled NRSIs did not randomly allocate participants but did include a control group of participants who did not receive convalescent plasma. The remaining 16 studies (5201 participants) were not randomised and did not include a control group (non‐controlled NRSIs) but provided information about unwanted effects of convalescent plasma. To assess whether convalescent plasma is an effective treatment for COVID‐19, we evaluated results from the RCT and three controlled NRSIs. The control groups received standard care at the time of treatment without convalescent plasma. There was not enough evidence to determine whether or not convalescent plasma affected the risk of death due to any cause at hospital discharge, time to death, or need for breathing support. To assess whether convalescent plasma causes unwanted effects, we also evaluated the 16 non‐controlled NRSIs (5201 participants). We identified some serious unwanted effects, which could be related to convalescent plasma, including death, allergic reactions or respiratory complications. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious unwanted events. None of the included studies reported effects on quality of life. Certainty of the evidence Our certainty (confidence) in the evidence was very limited because there was only one randomised study and most studies did not use reliable methods to measure their results. Furthermore, participants received various treatments alongside convalescent plasma, and some had underlying health problems. Conclusion We are very uncertain whether plasma from people who have recovered from COVID‐19 is an effective treatment for people hospitalised with COVID‐19. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious harms. These findings could be related to the natural progression of the disease, other treatments that the participants received, or to convalescent plasma. Our searches found 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. This is the first living update of our review, and we will continue to update this review with results from completed studies.	false
0	COVID-19 in children: Epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis and management. The new pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected children, including neonates, who mostly comprise of approximately 2% of total confirmed cases. Most children are asymptomatic or have mild disease and much lower mortality compared to adults for yet unknown reasons. Recovery from illness has largely been universal and <2% have severe disease requiring intensive care. Standardised guidelines from initial studies are now available for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Treatment is mostly supportive with no recommendations for any specific drugs so far. As the pandemic evolves, it is expected that more children will be diagnosed and treated with evolving newer regimens. Research should now focus on early diagnosis, better drugs for children, intensive care modalities, and a universal vaccine. New developments will help in better prevention asides from the other precautionary measures already being practiced.	false

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection serology: a useful tool to overcome lockdown?. The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly, inducing a progressive growth in infected patients number. Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.	false
0	"Opportunity of periodic monitoring of COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic virus carriers, and postinfectious individuals with IgM/IgG rapid antibody tests among healthcare workers during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The first Hungarian COVID-19 case was reported on March 4, 2020 by Hungarian officials. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic. The single-stranded viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR from the respiratory tract, urine, blood and, particulary in children, from stool samples for 30-40 days. We have no valid data of how many HCWs have been infected since the Hungarian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the lack of the systematic screening. HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., ""already protected"", the ones in the acute phase, i.e., ""the infectious"", and the virus-naive, i.e., ""at risk"" workers. Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Copyright © Szerzo(k)."	false

0	Pediatric COVID-19: Systematic review of the literature. Objectives: There is limited data regarding the demographics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population. Method(s): A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data. Result(s): Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1 day to 17 years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1 year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.0018%. Conclusion(s): In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

0	"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): the portrait of a perfect storm. The ""novel"" coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated ""COVID-19"") is the third coronavirus outbreak emerging during the past two decades. This infectious disease, sustained by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Despite the concerning epidemiological burden, many people, including some policymakers, are underestimating this pandemic and are remaining enigmatically inactive against a human pathology which, for a combination of reasons, can be reasonably defined as a perfect storm (i.e., the ""wrong virus"" at the ""wrong time""). These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken. Everybody should be inexcusably aware that this is not a drill, and that the consequences of inadequate action will be tragedy. Copyright 2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

0	Potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in an animal model by a human monoclonal antibody. Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID19 pandemic. We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phage-displayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from high-titer intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge (10 5 plaque forming units). Another antibody, VH ab5 did not compete with hACE2 and ab1, and did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 although its affinity was comparable to that of ab1. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.	false
0	Test performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Background: Serological tests are crucial tools for assessments of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, infection and potential immunity. Their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate assay performance data., Method: We conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two ELISAs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The specimen set comprised 128 plasma or serum samples from 79 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; 108 pre-COVID-19 negative controls; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples were blinded and LFA results were interpreted by two independent readers, using a standardized intensity scoring system., Results: Among specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals, the percent seropositive increased with time interval, peaking at 81.8-100.0% in samples taken >20 days after symptom onset. Test specificity ranged from 84.3-100.0% in pre-COVID-19 specimens. Specificity was higher when weak LFA bands were considered negative, but this decreased sensitivity. IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and detection was highest when IgM and IgG results were combined. Agreement between ELISAs and LFAs ranged from 75.7-94.8%. No consistent cross-reactivity was observed., Conclusion: Our evaluation showed heterogeneous assay performance. Reader training is key to reliable LFA performance, and can be tailored for survey goals. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence. Well-designed studies to elucidate the mechanisms and serological correlates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies.	false
0	COVID-19 pandemic: A review based on current evidence. In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, a novel coronavirus, initiated an outbreak of pneumonia from Wuhan in China, which rapidly spread worldwide. The clinical characteristics of the disease range from asymptomatic cases or mild symptoms, which include nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion to severe cases such as pneumonia, respiratory failure demanding mechanical ventilation to multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death. As the transmission rate is quite alarming, we require an effective therapeutic strategy to treat symptomatic patients and adopt the preventive measures in order to contain the infection and prevent community transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, hence repurposing of the drugs is an attractive and a feasible option because PK/PD profile, toxicity profile, and drug interactions are already known. This review emphasizes on the different aspects of COVID-19 such as the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and preventive measures to be adopted in order to fight this pandemic. It also highlights upon the ethics preparedness and challenges faced by a developing country like India during such an outbreak. The review focuses on the various approaches adopted till date for developing effective therapeutic strategies including combination of drugs, vaccine therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to combat this viral outbreak.Copyright: © 2020 Indian Journal of Pharmacology.	false
0	COVID-19 and the re-opening of schools: A policy maker's dilemma. The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the world. In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school's closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus. Moreover, the lockdown and the school closure could have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education and their mental health. As many countries have already entered or are planning a phase of gradual lifting of the containment measures of social distancing, it seems plausible that the re-opening of nursery schools and primary schools could be considered a policy to be implemented at an early stage of recovery efforts, putting in place measures to do it safely, such as the maintenance of social distance, the reorganisation of classes into smaller groups, the provision of adequate sanitization of spaces, furniture and toys, the prompt identification of cases in the school environment and their tracing. Therefore, policy makers have the task of balancing pros and cons of the school re-opening strategy, taking into account psychological, educational and social consequences for children and their families. Another issue to be considered is represented by socio-economic disparities and inequalities which could be amplified by school's closure.Copyright © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access	false

Recently, two separate approaches yielded successful antibody treatments for Ebola - one from genetically-humanized mice, and the other from a human survivor. Here, we describe parallel efforts using both humanized mice and convalescent patients to generate antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, yielding a large collection of fully-human antibodies that were characterized for binding, neutralization and three dimensional structure. Based on these criteria, we selected pairs of highly-potent individual antibodies that simultaneously bind the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, providing ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that aims to decrease the potential for virus escape mutants that might arise in response to selective pressure from a single antibody treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Isolation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection from disease in a small animal model. Countermeasures to prevent and treat COVID-19 are a global health priority. We enrolled a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-recovered participants, developed neutralization assays to interrogate antibody responses, adapted our high-throughput antibody generation pipeline to rapidly screen over 1800 antibodies, and established an animal model to test protection. We isolated potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to two epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and to distinct non-RBD epitopes on the spike (S) protein. We showed that passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against disease in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters, as revealed by maintained weight and low lung viral titers in treated animals. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19. The nAbs define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	Stroke as a complication and prognostic factor of COVID-19. Introduction: Contradictory data have been reported on the incidence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with history of stroke. Method(s): This study systematically reviews case series reporting stroke as a complication of COVID-19, and analyses the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and history of stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in patients with COVID-19 are also reviewed. Conclusion(s): History of stroke increases the risk of death due to COVID-19 by 3 times. Stroke currently seems not to be one of the main complications of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia	false

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has dramatically increased the workload for health systems and a consequent need to optimise resources has arisen, including the selection of patients for swab tests. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and undergoing swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. Complete blood counts (CBCs) were analysed looking for predictors of test positivity. Eight significant predictors were identified and used to build a 'complete' CBC score with a discriminatory power for COVID-19 diagnosis of AUC 92% (p<0.0001). When looking at the weight of individual variables, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), age, platelets and eosinophils (MAPE: MCV <=90 fL, 65 points; age >=45 years, 100 points; platelets <=180x103/muL, 73 points; eosinophils <0.01/muL, 94 points) gave the highest contribution and were used to build a 'simplified' MAPE score with a discriminatory power of AUC 88%. By setting the cut-off MAPE score at >=173 points, sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis were 83% and 82%, respectively, and the actual test positivity rate was 60% as compared to 6% of patients with MAPE score <173 points (odds ratio 23.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1-58.3, p-value <0.0001). In conclusion, CBC-based scores have potential for optimising the SARS-CoV-2 testing process: if these findings are confirmed in the future, swab tests may be waived for subjects with low score and uncertain symptoms, while they may be considered for asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients with high scores.

0	Anxiety and depression and its correlates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan. OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke-out in Wuhan China in December 2019, and spread throughout the entire country within a short time. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety., RESULTS: A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.	false
0	Real-time assessment of COVID-19 prevalence among multiple sclerosis patients: a multicenter European study. We assessed the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients across Europe by leveraging participant data collected as part of the ongoing EU IMI2 RADAR-CNS major programme aimed at finding new ways of monitoring neurological disorders using wearable devices and smartphone technology. In the present study, 399 patients of RADAR-MS have been included (mean age 43.9 years, 60.7% females) with 87/399 patients (21.8%) reporting major symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A trend for an increased risk of COVID-19 symptoms under alemtuzumab and cladribine treatments in comparison to injectables was observed. Remote monitoring technologies may support health authorities in monitoring and containing the ongoing pandemic.	false
0	Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the time of COVID-19-how has the landscape changed for Pakistan?. The incidence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been rising consistently in Pakistan, and the country is likely to experience another surge of cases in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. It is imperative to consider how the rising proportion of XDR-TB is best tackled during the pandemic; this includes finding a solution to the problem of non-adherence at the level of community-based healthcare, the utility and practicality of simultaneous testing for COVID-19 and TB, and reconciliation of the World Health Organization's recommendation of home-based treatment with the need for frequent monitoring of anti-tubercular therapy in XDR-TB. Operational research is needed expeditiously to bypass these limitations.	false
0	Health-related concerns and precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of Canadians with and without underlying health conditions. BACKGROUND: The risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as hospitalization, admission to intensive care units and death, is elevated for older individuals and those with certain underlying health conditions including diabetes, chronic conditions affecting lungs, heart or kidneys, and a compromised immune system., DATA AND METHODS: Data collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020 from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1: Impacts of COVID-19 (n=4,627) were used to estimate the prevalence of underlying health conditions, health concerns and precautionary behaviours among Canadians aged 15 or older living in the provinces. Multivariate analyses examined associations between these variables after accounting for age, sex and education., RESULTS: Close to 1 in 4 Canadians (24%) had an underlying health condition that increased their risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Overall, 36% of the population were very or extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their own health. Individuals with underlying health conditions had higher odds (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 2.5) of being highly concerned than those without these conditions, after adjustment for demographic characteristics. High percentages of Canadians took precautions to reduce the risk of infection regardless of whether or not they had underlying health conditions., DISCUSSION: Health status was associated with higher levels of concern for one's own health in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most Canadians were taking precautions recommended by public health authorities to protect themselves and others.	false
0	Musculoskeletal Consequences of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the majority of patients who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, some patients develop severe symptoms that can permanently detract from their quality of life. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both viruses infect the respiratory system, and there are direct and indirect effects of this infection on multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system. Epidemiological data from the SARS pandemic of 2002 to 2004 identified myalgias, muscle dysfunction, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis as common sequelae in patients with moderate and severe forms of this disease. Early studies have indicated that there is also considerable musculoskeletal dysfunction in some patients with COVID-19, although long-term follow-up studies have not yet been conducted. The purpose of this article was to summarize the known musculoskeletal pathologies in patients with SARS or COVID-19 and to combine this with computational modeling and biochemical signaling studies to predict musculoskeletal cellular targets and long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.	false
0	Clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant patient after caesarean delivery. The clinical implications of COVID-19 in pregnancy remain unknown. While preliminary reports demonstrate that pregnant patients have a similar symptomatic presentation to the general population, the appropriate management and timing of delivery in these patients is still unclear, as pregnancy may impose additional risk factors and impede recovery in gravid patients. In this brief report, we present a case of COVID-19 in a pregnant patient with severe respiratory compromise, whose clinical status significantly improved after caesarean delivery. We also address the potential benefits of experimental therapy, including tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 receptors. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

0	Management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Canada during the coronavirus pandemic. The emergence of the covid-19 disease pandemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus has required a re-evaluation of treatment practices for clinicians caring for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). The American Society for Hematology (ash) has provided a series of recommendations for the treatment of patients with cll during the pandemic, covering a range of topics, including testing for covid-19, cll treatment initiation and selection, use of immunoglobulin therapy, in-person monitoring, and treatment of patients with cll and covid-19. We summarize the ash recommendations and discuss their applicability as guidelines for the treatment of cll during the covid-19 pandemic in Canada. Copyright 2020 Multimed Inc.	false
0	Obesity and Higher Risk for Severe Complications of Covid-19: What to do when the two pandemics meet. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread around the globe, infecting more than ten million individuals, with more than 500,000 dead; about one half of the infected people have recovered. Despite this fact, a subgroup of individuals affected by COVID-19 is at greater risk of developing worse outcomes and experience a high rate of mortality. Data on the association between obesity and COVID-19 are growing; the available studies, have reported a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients experiencing a severe COVID-19 course, with serious complications requiring hospitalization and admission to intensive care units. This paper attempts to highlight potential mechanisms behind the greater vulnerability to COVID-19 of individuals with obesity. The presence of uncontrolled chronic obesity-related comorbidities, particularly pulmonary diseases, can present a primary fertile soil for respiratory tract infection. Combined with immune system impairments, such as alteration in the T-cell proliferation and macrophage differentiation, and the high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the adipose organ, this may worsen the general condition toward a systemic diffusion of infection. Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.

0	Acute complications and mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly characterized. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to summarize the evidence on clinically relevant outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19., METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and medRxiv were searched up to April 20, 2020, for studies including hospitalized symptomatic adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The secondary outcomes included acute cardiac or kidney injury, shock, coagulopathy, and venous thromboembolism. The main analysis was based on data from peer-reviewed studies. Summary estimates and the corresponding 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were obtained through meta-analyses., RESULTS: A total of 44 peer-reviewed studies with 14,866 COVID-19 patients were included. In general, risk of bias was high. All-cause mortality was 10% overall (95% PI, 2 to 39%; 1687/14203 patients; 43 studies), 34% in patients admitted to intensive care units (95% PI, 8 to 76%; 659/2368 patients; 10 studies), 83% in patients requiring invasive ventilation (95% PI, 1 to 100%; 180/220 patients; 6 studies), and 75% in patients who developed ARDS (95% PI, 35 to 94%; 339/455 patients; 11 studies). On average, ARDS occurred in 14% of patients (95% PI, 2 to 59%; 999/6322 patients; 23 studies), acute cardiac injury in 15% (95% PI, 5 to 38%; 452/2389 patients; 10 studies), venous thromboembolism in 15% (95% PI, 0 to 100%; patients; 3 studies), acute kidney injury in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 41%; 318/4682 patients; 15 studies), coagulopathy in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 39%; 223/3370 patients; 9 studies), and shock in 3% (95% PI, 0 to 61%; 203/4309 patients; 13 studies)., CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was very high in critically ill patients based on very low-quality evidence due to striking heterogeneity and risk of bias. The incidence of clinically relevant outcomes was substantial, although reported by only one third of the studies suggesting considerable underreporting., TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration ID for this study is CRD42020177243 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=177243 ).	false
0	The theoretical mortality risk of an asymptomatic patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test developing COVID-19 following elective orthopaedic surgery. AIMS: The risk to patients and healthcare workers of resuming elective orthopaedic surgery following the peak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been difficult to quantify. This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway., METHODS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario., RESULTS: The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery., CONCLUSION: Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.	false

0	Combating the Coronavirus Pandemic: Early Detection, Medical Treatment, and a Concerted Effort by the Global Community. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, a pandemic, as the coronavirus has now infected over 2.6 million people globally and caused more than 185,000 fatalities as of April 23, 2020. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a respiratory illness with symptoms such as dry cough, fever, sudden loss of smell, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. To date, there is no specific vaccine or treatment proven effective against this viral disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is thus critical to curbing its spread and improving health outcomes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used to detect the presence of COVID-19. Other techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and microfluidics, have allowed better disease diagnosis. Here, as part of the effort to expand screening capacity, we review advances and challenges in the rapid detection of COVID-19 by targeting nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies. We also summarize potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 and discuss ongoing clinical trials of interventions to reduce viral progression.	false
0	Novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in children. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019. The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.Copyright © TUBITAK.	false
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Specific Antibody Responses in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients. A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged to cause a human pandemic. Although molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are needed for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir, and epidemiologic studies. We developed serologic assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike protein-specific, and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrated that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected persons seroconverted by 2 weeks after disease onset. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity, and sensitivity varied between the 2 assays; the IgA ELISA showed higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described can be instrumental for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiologic, and vaccine evaluation studies.	false

0	COVID-19 and comorbidities: A systematic review and meta-analysis. 1.0 Abstract SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic that began with an outbreak of pneumonia cases in the Hubei province of China. Knowledge of those most at risk is integral for treatment, guideline implementation and resource allocation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate comorbidities associated with severe and fatal cases of COVID-19. A search was conducted on PubMed and EmBase on April 20, 2020. Pooled estimates were collected using a random effects model. Thirty three studies were included in the systematic review and twenty two in the meta-analysis. Of the total cases 40.80% (95%CI: 35.49%, 46.11%) had comorbidities, while fatal cases had 74.37% (95%CI: 55.78%, 86.97%). Hypertension was more prevalent in severe [47.65% (95%CI: 35.04%, 60.26%)] and fatal [47.90% (95%CI: 40.33%, 55.48%)] cases compared to total cases [14.34% (95%CI: 6.60%, 28.42%)]. Diabetes was more prevalent among fatal cases [24.89% (95%CI: 18.80%, 32.16%)] compared to total cases [9.65% (95%CI: 6.83%, 13.48%)]. Respiratory diseases had a higher prevalence in fatal cases [10.89% (95%CI: 7.57%, 15.43%)] in comparison to total cases [3.65% (95%CI: 2.16%, 6.1%)]. Studies assessing the mechanisms accounting for the associations between severe cases and hypertension, diabetes and respiratory diseases are crucial in understanding this new disease, managing patients at risk and developing policies and guidelines that will reduce future risk of severe COVID-19 disease.	false

0	Risk and Management of Patients with Mastocytosis and MCAS in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic: Expert Opinions. The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has massively distorted our health care systems and caused catastrophic consequences in our affected communities. The number of victims continues to increase and patients at risk can only be protected to a degree, since the virulent state may be asymptomatic. Risk factors concerning COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality include advanced age, an impaired immune system, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treated with chemotherapy. Here within, we discuss the risk and impact of COVID-19 in patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. As no published data are yet available, expert opinions are, by necessity, based on case experience and reports from patients. Whereas the overall risk to acquire the SARS-CoV-2 virus may not be elevated in mast cell disease, certain conditions may increase the risk of infected patients to develop severe COVID-19. These factors include certain co-morbidities, mast cell activation-related events affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, such treatments should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis during a COVID-19 infection. By contrast, other therapies, such as anti-mediator-type drugs, venom immunotherapy, or vitamin D, should be continued. Overall, patients with mast cell disorders should follow the general and local guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic and advice from their medical provider.Copyright © 2020.

0	COVID-19 pandemic in the italian population: Validation of a post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire and prevalence of PTSD symptomatology. Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted worldwide attention for its rapid and exponential diffusion. The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event. Psychological interventions to counteract short-and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Immune responses and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during an outbreak in Iran: Comparison with SARS and MERS. The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans. There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	false
0	COVID-19 and its effects on the digestive system and endoscopy practice. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several studies have demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is also a potential route. As the pandemic is continuously evolving, and more data are made available, this article highlights the best evidence and practices regarding the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus relevant to GI practice. Published clinical studies have supported that SARS-CoV-2 affects the GI tract and the liver. The largest published dataset comprised of 4243 patients and showed a pooled prevalence of GI symptoms at 17.6%. GI symptoms varied and usually preceded pulmonary symptoms by 1-2 days. These include anorexia (26.8%), nausea and vomiting (10.2%), diarrhea (12.5%), and abdominal pain (9.2%). Incidence of liver injury ranges from 15 to 53%. Evidence shows that the severity of COVID-19 infection is compounded by its effects on nutrition, most especially for the critically ill. As such, nutrition societies have recommended optimization of oral diets and oral nutritional supplements followed by early enteral nutrition if nutritional targets are not met, and parenteral nutrition in the distal end of the spectrum. In addition to possible fecal-oral transmission, GI endoscopy procedures, which are considered to be aerosol-generating procedures, contribute to increased risk to GI health-care professionals. Infection prevention measures and guidelines are essential in protecting both patients and personnel.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Neutrophil to CD4+ lymphocyte ratio as a potential biomarker in predicting virus negative conversion time in COVID-19. Background: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. Our study aimed to evaluate the robustness of neutrophil to CD4+ lymphocyte ratio (NCD4LR) in predicting the negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to evaluate the independency of NCD4LR in predicting NCT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): Compared with low NCD4LR patients, patients with high NCD4LR had an older age; higher incidence of fever, fatigue, chest distress/breath shortness, severer disease assessment on admission; higher levels of inflammatory indicators; low levels of lymphocyte subsets, and a longer NCT. Multivariate analysis also identified NCD4LR as an independent risk factor for delayed NCT. ROC analysis showed that NCD4LR had a better performance than neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in predicting the virus negative conversion within 2 weeks (AUC = 0.772), 3 weeks (AUC = 0.710), 4 weeks (AUC = 0.728), or 5 weeks (AUC = 0.815). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that NCD4LR is a potential and useful biomarker for predicting the virus negative conversion time in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, due to the NCDLR value is easily calculated, it can be widely used as a clinical biomarker for disease progression and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

0	Covid-19 and diabetes mellitus: unveiling the interaction of two pandemics. A novel RNA betacoronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO. Guo et al published the first report of biochemical features in patients with diabetes and the further risk that this disease can determine to the progression of Covid-19. Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation, may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection. Targeting the overexpression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false

0	Validation of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ELISA for use in contact investigations and serosurveillance. Since emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, there has been a critical need to understand prevalence, transmission patterns, to calculate the burden of disease and case fatality rates. Molecular diagnostics, the gold standard for identifying viremic cases, are not ideal for determining true case counts and rates of asymptomatic infection. Serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can contribute to filling these knowledge gaps. In this study, we describe optimization and validation of a SARS-CoV-2-specific-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the prefusion-stabilized form of the spike protein [1]. We performed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses to define the specificities and sensitivities of the optimized assay and examined cross reactivity with immune sera from persons confirmed tohave had infections with other coronaviruses. These assays will be used to perform contact investigations and to conduct large-scale, cross sectional surveillance to define disease burden in the population.	false

Objectives: To describe the pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care in a module hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and provide reference for domestic and foreign pharmacists participating in the epidemic prevention and control. Setting(s): The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. Practice description: One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth 1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. Practice innovation: The new COVID-19 ""module"" pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and ""zero contact"" pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform ""WeChat."" This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. Evaluation: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. Result(s): The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. Conclusion(s): The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.Copyright © 2020 American Pharmacists Association"	false
0	Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE(S): The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHOD(S): IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULT(S): The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSION(S): Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Coping with hypoxemia: Could erythropoietin (EPO) be an adjuvant treatment of COVID-19?. A very recent epidemiological study provides preliminary evidence that living in habitats located at 2500 m above sea level (masl) might protect from the development of severe respiratory symptoms following infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. This epidemiological finding raises the question of whether physiological mechanisms underlying the acclimatization to high altitude identifies therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome pivotal to the reduction of global mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article compares the symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) with those of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores overlapping patho-physiological mechanisms of the respiratory system including impaired oxygen transport, pulmonary gas exchange and brainstem circuits controlling respiration. In this context, we also discuss the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on oxygen sensing in the carotid body. Finally, since erythropoietin (EPO) is an effective prophylactic treatment for AMS, this article reviews the potential benefits of implementing FDA-approved erythropoietin-based (EPO) drug therapies to counteract a variety of acute respiratory and non-respiratory (e.g. excessive inflammation of vascular beds) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Prognosis of COVID-19 in Patients with Liver and Kidney Diseases: An Early Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The mortality and severity in COVID-19 is increased in patients with comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with underlying kidney and liver diseases. We retrieved data on the clinical features and primary composite end point of COVID-19 patients from Medline and Embase which had been released from inception by the April 16, 2020. The data on two comorbidities, liver diseases and chronic kidney disease, were pooled and statistically analysed to explain the associated severity and mortality rate. One hundred and forty-Two abstracts were screened, and 41 full articles were then read. In total, 22 studies including 5595 COVID-19 patients were included in this study with case fatality rate of 16%. The prevalence of liver diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were 3% (95% CI; 2-3%) and 1% (95% CI; 1-2%), respectively. In patients with COVID-19 and underlying liver diseases, 57.33% (43/75) of cases were severe, with 17.65% mortality, while in CKD patients, 83.93% (47/56) of cases were severe and 53.33% (8/15) mortality was reported. This study found an increased risk of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with liver diseases or CKD. This will lead to better clinical management and inform the process of implementing more stringent preventative measures for this group of patients.Copyright © 2020 MDPI AG.

0	Neurosurgery and Neurology Practices during the Novel COVID-19 Pandemic: A Consensus Statement from India. Background: The COVID-19 infection outbreak has aroused increasing attention and affected thousands of people nationwide. The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission. Objective(s): The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India Methodology: In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India. Result(s): Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly. Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources. Conclusion(s): These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.Copyright © 2020 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.	false

0	Research methodology and characteristics of journal articles with original data, preprint articles and registered clinical trial protocols about COVID-19. BACKGROUND: The research community reacted rapidly to the emergence of COVID-19. We aimed to assess characteristics of journal articles, preprint articles, and registered trial protocols about COVID-19 and its causal agent SARS-CoV-2. METHOD(S): We analyzed characteristics of journal articles with original data indexed by March 19, 2020, in World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 collection, articles published on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv by April 3, 2010. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of clinical trials indexed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) by April 7, 2020. RESULT(S): Among the first 2118 articles on COVID-19 published in scholarly journals, 533 (25%) contained original data. The majority was published by authors from China (75%) and funded by Chinese sponsors (75%); a quarter was published in the Chinese language. Among 312 articles that self-reported study design, the most frequent were retrospective studies (N=88; 28%) and case reports (N=86; 28%), analyzing patients' characteristics (38%). Median Journal Impact Factor of journals where articles were published was 5.099. Among 1088 analyzed preprint articles, the majority came from authors affiliated in China (51%) and were funded by sources in China (46%). Less than half reported study design; the majority were modeling studies (62%), and analyzed transmission/risk/prevalence (43%). Of the 927 analyzed registered trials, the majority were interventional (58%). Half were already recruiting participants. The location for the conduct of the trial in the majority was China (N=522; 63%). The median number of planned participants was 140 (range: 1 to 15,000,000). Registered intervention trials used highly heterogeneous primary outcomes and tested highly heterogeneous interventions; the most frequently studied interventions were hydroxychloroquine (N=39; 7.2%) and chloroquine (N=16; 3%). CONCLUSION(S): Early articles on COVID-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modeling studies. The diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for COVID-19 research. Chinese scholars had a head start in reporting about the new disease, but publishing articles in Chinese may limit their global reach. Mapping publications with original data can help finding gaps that will help us respond better to the new public health emergency.	false
0	Early Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 28 Cases of Coronavirus Disease in South Korea. Objectives: The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea was reported in January 2020, with 28 confirmed cases reported as of February 14th, 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all 28 cases were analyzed in response to this disease., Methods: The epidemiological characteristics and early clinical features of the 28 patients from Korea with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed using COVID-19 reporting and surveillance data and the epidemiological investigation reports prepared by the rapid response team., Results: There were 16 patients that entered Korea from foreign countries: Wuhan, China (11 patients), Zhuhai, China, (1 patient), Singapore (2 patients), Japan (1 patient), and Thailand (1 patient). The early symptoms were fever, sore throat, cough or sputum production, chills, and muscle ache. Three patients were asymptomatic, however, 18 developed pneumonia. Of the 28 cases, 16 were index cases imported from abroad, with 10 cases of secondary infection originating in Korea, and the route of transmission still under investigation for 2 patients. The 10 patients with secondary infection were infected from contact with family members or acquaintances of primary patients, and the suspected sites of transmission were mostly at home., Conclusion: COVID-19 in Korea was spread by 16 infected individuals traveling from other countries, leading to second-generation cases. The initial symptoms were mostly minor, but the disease was infectious at this stage, resulting from close contact, particularly at home. Establishing an early detection strategy for COVID-19 is crucial for managing the transmission of the disease. Copyright ©2020, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	false

0	Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Pediatric Patients: A Review of Epidemiology, Symptomatology, Laboratory and Imaging Results to Guide the Development of a Management Algorithm. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic. Compared to adults, there has been a significantly smaller number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, although the incidence is increasing every day. This article looks to review specific epidemiological factors, symptomatology, laboratory and imaging workup, and other relevant metrics derived from the limited published literature that are specific to the pediatric population, to provide a review for the pediatric practitioner and guide, in part, the creation of a clinical algorithm for the management of COVID-19 in the pediatric population that can be utilized by pediatric institutions.

0	The diagnostic value of detecting sudden smell loss among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in early stage: The possible early sign of COVID-19. Importance: The newly emerged coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is threatening the world. Olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is reported as one of the symptoms worldwide. As reported so far, different clinical features have been reported according to outbreak sites and gender; most of the patients, who complained of anosmia or hyposmia, were Europeans. We had a fast review for novel articles about COVID-19 infection and olfactory function. Observations: Rapid reviews for COVID-19 or other viral infection and olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions were done in this review. Up to date, a lot of reports have shown that olfactory dysfunction is related to viral infections but no exact mechanism, clinical course, and definite treatment have been discovered, which is also same in COVID-19. In general, intranasal steroid (INS) and oral steroid for short time help improve the recovery of the olfactory function in case of olfactory dysfunction after virus infection. Considering severe respiratory complications and immunocompromised state of COVID-19, the use of steroid should be limited and cautious because we do not have enough data to support the usage of steroid to treat olfactory dysfunction in the clinical course of COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: In the days of pandemic COVID-19, we should keep in mind that olfactory dysfunctions, even without other upper respiratory infection or otolaryngologic symptoms, might be the early signs of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false

0	The prevalence of symptoms in 24,410 adults infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis of 148 studies from 9 countries. BACKGROUND: To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, an evidence-based understanding of the symptoms is critical to inform guidelines for quarantining and testing. The most common features are purported to be fever and a new persistent cough, although the global prevalence of these symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 worldwide. METHOD(S): We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, medRxiv and bioRxiv on 5th April 2020 for studies of adults (>16 years) with laboratory test confirmed COVID-19. No language or publication status restrictions were applied. Data were independently extracted by two review authors into standardised forms. All datapoints were independently checked by three other review authors. A random-effects model for pooling of binomial data was applied to estimate the prevalence of symptoms, subgrouping estimates by country. I2 was used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. RESULT(S): Of 851 unique citations, 148 articles were included which comprised 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from 9 countries. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (78% [95% CI 75%-81%]; 138 studies, 21,701 patients; I2 94%), a cough (57% [95% CI 54%-60%]; 138 studies, 21,682 patients; I2 94%) and fatigue (31% [95% CI 27%-35%]; 78 studies, 13,385 patients; I2 95%). Overall, 19% of hospitalised patients required non-invasive ventilation (44 studies, 6,513 patients), 17% required intensive care (33 studies, 7504 patients), 9% required invasive ventilation (45 studies, 6933 patients) and 2% required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (12 studies, 1,486 patients). The mortality rate was 7% (73 studies, 10,402 patients). CONCLUSION(S): We confirm that fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms of adults infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a large proportion of infected adults which symptoms-alone do not identify.	false
0	COVID-19 outbreak in North Italy: An overview on dentistry. A questionnaire survey. This survey assessed the symptoms/signs, protective measures, awareness, and perception levels regarding COVID-19 among dentists in Lombardy, Italy. Moreover, an analysis of the answers gathered in areas with different prevalence of the disease was carried out. All Lombardy's dentists were sent an online ad hoc questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four domains: personal data, precautionary measures (before patient arrival; in the waiting room; in the operating room), awareness, and perception. Three thousand five hundred ninety-nine questionnaires were analyzed. Five hundred two (14.43%) participants had suffered one or more symptoms referable to COVID-19. Thirty-one subjects were positive to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and 16 subjects developed the disease. Only a small number of dentists (n = 72, 2.00%) were confident of avoiding infection; dentists working in low COVID-19 prevalence areas were more confident than those working in the Milan area and high prevalence area (61.24%, 61.23%, and 64.29%, p < 0.01 respectively). The level of awareness was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Milan area (71.82%) than in the other areas. This survey demonstrated that dentists in the COVID-19 highest prevalence area, albeit reported to have more symptoms/signs than the rest of the sample, were the ones who adopted several precautionary measures less frequently and were the more confident of avoiding infection.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	The CoV-2 outbreak: how hematologists could help to fight Covid-19. COVID-19 is a medical emergency, with 20 % of patients presenting with severe clinical manifestations. From the pathogenetic point of view, COVID-19 mimics two other well-known diseases characterized by cytokine storm and hyper-activation of the immune response, with consequent organ damage: acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19. The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab. We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs. A possible combined treatment algorithm for COVID-19 is here proposed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons. Objective: The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method(s): An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. Result(s): A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusion(s): Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Modeling shield immunity to reduce COVID-19 epidemic spread. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 20201-4. Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.	false
0	Dynamic evolution of COVID-19 on chest computed tomography: experience from Jiangsu Province of China. Objectives: To determine the patterns of chest computed tomography (CT) evolution according to disease severity in a large coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cohort in Jiangsu Province, China. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 10, 2020, to February 18, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province were included, retrospectively. Quantitative CT measurements of pulmonary opacities including volume, density, and location were extracted by deep learning algorithm. Dynamic evolution of these measurements was investigated from symptom onset (day 1) to beyond day 15. Comparison was made between severity groups. Result(s): A total of 484 patients (median age of 47 years, interquartile range 33-57) with 954 CT examinations were included, and each was assigned to one of the three groups: asymptomatic/mild (n = 63), moderate (n = 378), severe/critically ill (n = 43). Time series showed different evolution patterns of CT measurements in the groups. Following disease onset, posteroinferior subpleural area of the lung was the most common location for pulmonary opacities. Opacity volume continued to increase beyond 15 days in the severe/critically ill group, compared with peaking on days 13-15 in the moderate group. Asymptomatic/mild group had the lowest opacity volume which almost resolved after 15 days. The opacity density began to drop from day 10 to day 12 for moderately ill patients. Conclusion(s): Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity and their evolution on CT varied with disease severity in COVID-19. These findings are valuable in understanding the nature of the disease and monitoring the patient's condition during the course of illness. Key Points: * Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity on CT change over time in COVID-19. * The evolution of CT appearance follows specific pattern, varying with disease severity.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.	false
0	Dynamic chest CT evaluation in three cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). There have been some reports of imaging findings regarding the disease's characteristic features. Here, we report three cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dynamic pulmonary CT evaluation. The CT scan showed multiple regions of ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation in COVID-19 patients and the CT scan was useful in tracking the progression or regression of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R.

0	Management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, in the radiology department. Objectives: From December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19 was reported in China. Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Key Findings: The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. Conclusion(s): In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice: An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers	false
0	Several Common Respiratory Viral Pathogens in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantion Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHOD(S): 108 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected from 22 PID patients before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from July 2016 to July 2018 in the Department of Hematology. The TR-PCR was used to detect for respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus(RSV),human metapneumoviros(hMPV),coronavirus(CoV) and parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV1-3). And the clinical characteristics and co-infection were analyzed. RESULT(S): Among the total 108 specimens, viral pathogens were identified in 41 (37.96%) specimens. Among which the pathogens of highest detection rate was RSV (25.9%). Different types of PID showed different virus infection rates, among which the highest infection rate was severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients, with the virus detection rate was 57.9%. The incidence of co-infection with two or more than two viruses was 19.5%. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with PID who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are more susceptible to respiratory viruses. RSV is an important respiratory tract virus pathogen after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	false

Bioorthogonal activation of prodrugs provides a strategy for on-demand on-site production of therapeutics. Intracellular activation provides a strategy to localize therapeutics, potentially minimizing off-target effects. To this end, nanoparticles embedded with transition metal catalysts (nanozymes) were engineered to generate either ""hard"" irreversible or ""soft"" reversible coronas in serum. The hard corona induced nanozyme aggregation, effectively inhibiting nanozyme activity, whereas only modest loss of activity was observed with the nonaggregating soft corona nanozymes. In both cases complete activity was restored by treatment with proteases. Intracellular activity mirrored this reactivation: endogenous proteases in the endosome provided intracellular activation of both nanozymes. The role of intracellular proteases in nanozyme reactivation was verified through treatment of the cells with protease inhibitors, which prevented reactivation. This study demonstrates the use of intracellular proteolysis as a strategy for localization of therapeutic generation to within cells."	false
0	Mental Health and Psychosocial Problems of Medical Health Workers during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China. Objective: We explored whether medical health workers had more psychosocial problems than nonmedical health workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). Result(s): Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p <= 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Conclusion(s): During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them. They were in need of attention and recovery programs.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.	false
0	"The possible impairment of respiratory-related neural loops may be associated with the silent pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2. As compared to many other viral pulmonary infections, there existed several peculiar manifestations in the COVID-19 patients, including the ""silence"" of pneumonia in both mild and severe cases and a long intensive care unit stay for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Similar silent pneumonia has been documented in the infection induced by H5N1 influenza virus HK483, and was found to result from the direct attack of the virus on the bronchopulmonary C-fibers at the early stage and the final infection in the brainstem at the late stage. The long stay of critical patients in the intensive care unit is possibly due to the depression of central respiratory drive, which resulted in the failure to wean from the mechanic ventilation. Carotid and aortic bodies and bronchopulmonary C-fibers are two key peripheral components responsible for the chemosensitive responses in the respiratory system, while triggering respiratory reflexes depends predominantly on the putative chemosensitive neurons located in the pontomedullary nuclei. In view of the findings for H5N1 influenza virus, the silence of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 may be due to the possible impairment of peripheral chemosensitive reflexes as well as the damage to the respiratory-related central neurons.

0	The infodemics of COVID-19 amongst healthcare professionals in India. Background: There is a deluge of information and misinformation about COVID-19. The present survey was conducted to explore the sources of information /misinformation for healthcare professionals from India. Method(s): A cross-sectional online survey using snowballing technique was conducted from 24 Mar to 10 Apr 2020. The questionnaire was pretested and developed using standard techniques. It was circulated among medical students and physicians. Data were analysed using the STATA software. Result(s): Data of 758 participants were analysed. A total of 255 (33.6%) medical students, 335 (44.2%) nonspecialists and 168 (22.1%) specialists participated. The most common source of formal and informal information was official government websites and online news, respectively. A total of 517 (68.2%) participants accepted receiving misinformation. Social media and family and friends were the most common sources of misinformation. Seventy-two percent of participants agreed that spread of information helped to contain COVID-19, but more than that 75% agreed to having received inaccurate information. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt the need for regulation of information during such times; 26% and 33% felt that information about COVID-19 made them feel uncomfortable and distracts routine decision-making, respectively, and 50% felt it was difficult to differentiate correct from incorrect information about COVID-19. Conclusion(s): The study explored the sources of information and misinformation and found a high prevalence of misinformation, especially from social media. We suggest the need to better manage the flow of information so that it can be an effective weapon against SARS-CoV2. There is a need for doctors to adapt to the changing times of infodemics accompanying pandemics.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 Confinement and Health Risk Behaviors in Spain. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19. In response, most affected countries have enacted measures involving compulsory confinement and restrictions on free movement, which likely influence citizens' lifestyles. This study investigates changes in health risk behaviors (HRBs) with duration of confinement. An online cross-sectional survey served to collect data about the Spanish adult population regarding health behaviors during the first 3 weeks of confinement. A large sample of participants (N = 2,741) (51.8% women; mean age 34.2 years [SD 13.0]) from all Spanish regions completed the survey. Binomial logistic regressions adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, civil status, education, and occupation), body mass index (BMI), previous HRBs, and confinement context (i.e., solitude and exposure to COVID-19) were conducted to investigate associations between the number of weeks confined and a set of six HRBs (physical activity, alcohol consumption, fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours). When adjusted, we observed significantly lower odds of experiencing a higher number of HRBs than before confinement overall in a time-dependent fashion: OR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49-0.81 for the second and OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36-0.61 for the third week of confinement. These results were equally consistent in all age and gender subgroup analyses. The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each HRB except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of COVID-19 confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.

0	Continuous physiological monitoring using wearable technology to inform individual management of infectious diseases, public health and outbreak responses. Optimal management of infectious diseases is guided by up-to-date information at the individual and public health levels. For infections of global importance, including emerging pandemics such as COVID-19 or prevalent endemic diseases such as dengue, identifying patients at risk of severe disease and clinical deterioration can be challenging, considering that the majority present with a mild illness. In our article, we describe the use of wearable technology for continuous physiological monitoring in healthcare settings. Deployment of wearables in hospital settings for the management of infectious diseases, or in the community to support syndromic surveillance during outbreaks, could provide significant, cost-effective advantages and improve healthcare delivery. We highlight a range of promising technologies employed by wearable devices and discuss the technical and ethical issues relating to implementation in the clinic, focusing on low- and middle- income countries. Finally, we propose a set of essential criteria for the rollout of wearable technology for clinical use.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Papillary thyroid carcinoma presenting as miliary nodules on chest roentgenogram in the paediatric setting: A case report. Introduction: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common carcinoma to occur in childhood with a peak incidence between 11-17 years, and typically presents with advanced locoregional disease. Pulmonary metastases are seen in up to 46% of cases and should enter the differential diagnosis of miliary nodules seen on chest roentgenogram, even in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. Presentation of case: An 11-year-old male presented with a short history of cough, shortness of breath and constitutional symptoms. Examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy and diffuse bilateral nodular infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram. Investigation for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative and this initiated biopsy of a cervical lymph node. Histopathological examination revealed metastatic PTC. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed for preoperative staging. The patient subsequently underwent total thyroidectomy with selective neck dissection. Discussion(s): There are several potential causes when dealing with miliary nodules on chest roentgenogram. Thorough interrogation of the clinical, radiological, pathological and microbiological data is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Postoperative adjuvant therapy with radioactive iodine is recommended in children with metastatic disease, but this should be restricted preferably to a single dose to avoid the complication of pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the differential diagnostic considerations of a patient presenting with constitutional symptoms and a miliary pattern on chest roentgenogram. Carcinomas are uncommon in children but should not be forgotten.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Protecting Labor and Delivery Personnel from COVID-19 during the Second Stage of Labor. . Second stage of labor exposes providers to aerosol.. . COVID-19 risk during second stage of labor is high.. . N95 should be used during second stage of labor.. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population. Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation. In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP. The second stage of labor can last up to 4hours. During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage. We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients. This includes providing labor and delivery personnel full PPE including N95 for the second stage of labor. This is critical to ensure the adequate protection for health care workers and to prevent spread to other health care workers and patients.Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false
0	Recommendations for the Operation of Endoscopy Centers in the setting of the COVID19 pandemic - A WEO guidance document. SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2) is the etiologic agent causing the disease COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 19), resulting in a worldwide pandemic. Non emergent endoscopy services have been disrupted as incidence and hospitalizations were rising. It is anticipated that the peak incidence may be leveling off in many parts of the world, but there is a concern for resurgence of the virus activity. Thus, it is important for endoscopy units to have plans in place during peak times of the epidemic and when resuming endoscopic services as the pandemic wanes. The global endoscopy community is faced with the challenge of providing care during this time. The WEO-COVID guidance task force has provided this resource document based on the current evidence and consensus opinion. These WEO recommendations are meant to guide endoscopists worldwide, should be interpreted in light of specific clinical conditions and resource availability and may not apply in all situations. This guidance document does not supersede the need to check for all local regulations and legislations.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Thoracic computerised tomography scans in one hundred eighteen orthopaedic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: identification of chest lesions; added values; help in managing patients; burden on the computerised tomography scan department. Purpose: Based on the recent literature, chest computed tomography (CT) examination could aid for management of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Result(s): Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. Conclusion(s): Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.	false
0	Ophthalmologists' strategy for the prevention and control of coronavirus pneumonia with conjunctivitis or with conjunctivitis as the first symptom. China is currently in a critical stage of controlling the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). As ophthalmologists working in the center of Wuhan city, the virus's front line, we recently found conjunctivitis in five COVID-19 patients of a total of 92 COVID-19 patients.One of these five patients had conjunctivitis as the first symptom and was then diagnosed with COVID-19.These observations suggest: the mechanism and pathway of transmission of the novel coronavirus need to be further clarified; the symptoms of conjunctivitis accompanying novel coronavirus infection and conjunctiva as an important entrance point of the virus need to be further verified; early diagnosis, implementation of medical isolation, and giving appropriate treatment to patients with asymptomatic and mild-symptom conjunctivitis are essential to prevent the spread of the epidemic; those with conjunctivitis symptoms should be distinguished from other types of viral conjunctivitis; strict personal protection measures should be taken; and more sensitive techniques should be developed as soon as possible for virus detection in tear and conjunctiva swabs.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.	false
0	The different clinical characteristics of corona virus disease cases between children and their families in China-the character of children with COVID-19. This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health staff.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

0	Kawasaki disease shock syndrome or toxic shock syndrome in children and the relationship with COVID-19. Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms. However, in the last two months, first in Europe and recently in the United States, a small number of children have developed a more severe inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, which often leads to hospitalization and sometimes requires intensive care. A potential relationship was observed, especially between the occurrence of the Kawasaki disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Dynamic inflammatory response in a critically ill COVID-19 patient treated with corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of corticosteroids therapy on the inflammatory response in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient. METHOD(S): A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission. Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3+T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) were dynamically monitored. RESULT(S): On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3+ T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range. With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3+ T, CD8+ T and CD4 + T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: Y=18.59X+109.4, P<0.05). On D2 of admission, the patient's IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher than normal values, IFN-gamma was at a normal high value, and then rapidly decreased; IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-alpha were all in the normal range. On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time. On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative. On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged. At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90. CONCLUSION(S): In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.	false
0	Rapid design and implementation of an integrated patient self-triage and self-scheduling tool for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To rapidly deploy a digital patient-facing self-triage and self-scheduling tool in a large academic health system to address the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at the University of California, San Francisco Health, a large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into 1 of 4 categories-emergent, urgent, nonurgent, or self-care-and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULT(S): This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under 2 weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls, and in-person visits. CONCLUSION(S): Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Follow-up testing of viral nucleic acid in discharged patients with moderate type of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcome of patients with moderate type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after discharge by retesting viral nucleic acid. METHOD(S): Seven patients with moderate COVID-19 met the discharge criteria enacted by National Health Commission were quarantined in hospital for 7 days, then continuously quarantined at home for 4 weeks after discharged. During the quarantined period, the symptoms and signs were documented, and sputum or nasal swab and feces samples were collected to test SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR method. RESULT(S): There was no symptoms and signs during the quarantine period in all 7 patients. However, respiratory swabs from 3 patients were confirmed positive of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at 5 to 7 days after they met the discharge criteria. CONCLUSION(S): There is a relatively high incidence of positive viral nucleic acid in patients met the discharge criteria, and it is suggested that patients met the current discharge criteria should be quarantined in hospital for another 7 days and the follow-up viral testing is necessary.	false
0	Risk of nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease 2019: an experience in a general ward setting in Hong Kong. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. Aim(s): To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. Method(s): Contacts were identified and risk categorized as 'close' or 'casual' for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Finding(s): A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of 'close contact'. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.Copyright © 2020 The Healthcare Infection Society	false
0	Universal Testing for COVID-19 in Essential Orthopaedic Surgery Reveals a High Percentage of Asymptomatic Infections. BACKGROUND: The long incubation period and asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 present considerable challenges for health-care institutions. The identification of infected individuals is vital to prevent the spread of illness to staff and other patients as well as to identify those who may be at risk for disease-related complications. This is particularly relevant with the resumption of elective orthopaedic surgery around the world. We report the results of a universal testing protocol for COVID-19 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the coronavirus pandemic and to describe the postoperative course of asymptomatic patients who were positive for COVID-19. METHOD(S): A retrospective review of adult operative cases between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, at an orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City was performed. Initially, a screening questionnaire consisting of relevant signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) or exposure dictated the need for nasopharyngeal swab real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for all admitted patients. An institutional policy change occurred on April 5, 2020, that indicated nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for all orthopaedic admissions. Screening and testing data for COVID-19 as well as relevant imaging, laboratory values, and postoperative complications were reviewed for all patients. RESULT(S): From April 5, 2020, to April 24, 2020, 99 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 prior to their planned orthopaedic surgical procedure. Of the 12.1% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 58.3% were asymptomatic. Three asymptomatic patients developed postoperative hypoxia, with 2 requiring intubation. The negative predictive value of using the signs and symptoms of disease to predict a negative test result was 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0% to 97.1%). Including a positive chest radiographic finding as a screening criterion did not improve the negative predictive value of screening (92.5% [95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%]). CONCLUSION(S): A protocol for universal testing of all orthopaedic surgery admissions at 1 hospital in New York City during a 3-week period revealed a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Importantly, the majority of these patients were asymptomatic. Using chest radiography did not significantly improve the negative predictive value of screening.

0	Protease inhibitors: Candidate drugs to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication. The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a pandemic. However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 mug/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 mug/ mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020 Tohoku University Medical Press.	false

Background and purpose - The ongoing Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a toll on healthcare systems around the world. This has led to guidelines advising against elective procedures, which includes elective arthroplasty. Despite arthroplasty being an elective procedure, some arthroplasties are arguably essential, as pain or functional impairment maybe devastating for patients, especially during this difficult period. We describe our experience as the Division of Arthroplasty in the hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.Patients and methods - The number of COVID-19 cases reported both nationwide and at our institution from February 2020 to date were reviewed. We then collated the number of arthroplasties that we were able to cope with on a weekly basis and charted it against the number of new COVID-19 cases admitted to our institution and the prevalence of COVID-19 within the Singapore population.Results - During the COVID-19 pandemic period, a significant decrease in the volume of arthroplasties was seen. 47 arthroplasties were performed during the pandemic period from February to April, with a weekly average of 5 cases. This was a 74% reduction compared with our institutional baseline. The least number of surgeries were performed during early periods of the pandemic. This eventually rose to a maximum of 47% of our baseline numbers. Throughout this period, no cases of COVID-19 infection were reported amongst the orthopedic inpatients at our institution.Interpretation - During the early periods of the pandemic, careful planning was required to evaluate the pandemic situation and gauge our resources and manpower. Our study illustrates the number of arthroplasties that can potentially be done relative to the disease curve. This could serve as a guide to reinstating arthroplasty as the pandemic dies down. However, it is prudent to note that these situations are widely dynamic and frequent re-evaluation is required to secure patient and healthcare personnel safety, while ensuring appropriate care is delivered.	false
0	Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis in COVID-19 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Early reports of COVID-19 clinical features describe a hypercoagulable state, and recent guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin, but this would be contraindicated in the presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We address the key clinical question whether HIT is also present during COVID-19. We report 3 cases of thrombocytopenia with anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies among 16 intubated COVID-19 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, a higher than expected incidence of 19%. Each patient had evidence of thrombosis (pulmonary embolism, upper extremity venous thromboses, and skin necrosis, respectively). The serotonin release assay confirmed HIT in one case, and two cases were negative. We believe this is the first reported case of HIT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognition that the thrombocytopenia represented HIT in the confirmed case was delayed. We recommend clinicians monitor platelet counts closely during heparin therapy, with a low threshold to evaluate for HIT.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false

0	Computational modelling of flavivirus dynamics: The ins and outs. Enveloped viruses such as the flaviviruses represent a significant burden to human health around the world, with hundreds of millions of people each year affected by dengue alone. In an effort to improve our understanding of the molecular basis for the infective mechanisms of these viruses, extensive computational modelling approaches have been applied to elucidate their conformational dynamics. Multiscale protocols have been developed to simulate flavivirus envelopes in close accordance with biophysical data, in particular derived from cryo-electron microscopy, enabling high-resolution refinement of their structures and elucidation of the conformational changes associated with adaptation both to host environments and to immunological factors such as antibodies. Likewise, integrative modelling efforts combining data from biophysical experiments and from genome sequencing with chemical modification are providing unparalleled insights into the architecture of the previously unresolved nucleocapsid complex. Collectively, this work provides the basis for the future rational design of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccine development strategies targeting enveloped viruses.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, 2020. On 5 February 2020, in Yokohama, Japan, a cruise ship hosting 3,711 people underwent a 2-week quarantine after a former passenger was found with COVID-19 post-disembarking. As at 20 February, 634 persons on board tested positive for the causative virus. We conducted statistical modelling to derive the delayadjusted asymptomatic proportion of infections, along with the infections' timeline. The estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (95% credible interval (CrI): 15.5-20.2%). Most infections occurred before the quarantine start.Copyright © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.	false
0	Docking study of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-An in silico insight into the comparative efficacy of repurposing antiviral drugs. Recent outbreak of novel Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic around the world is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The death toll associated with the pandemic is increasing day by day. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and there are ample evidences that its Spike protein (S-protein) is mainly associated with pathogenesis as it is surface-exposed and mediates entry into host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. Therefore, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies upon infection and there is always a quest to inhibit the S-protein which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments for Covid-19 is still under debate globally because of some side effects associated with it. This study involves the In silico interactions of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. With the help of various computational methods, we have re-explored the potential role of both of these antiviral drugs for the treatment of Covid-19 patients by comparing the efficacy of both of the drugs to bind to S-protein at its host receptor region. In our research Hydroxychloroquine exhibited potential inhibitory effectsof S-protein with binding energy -7.28kcal/mol than Chloroquine (-6.30kcal/mol) at SARS-CoV-2 receptor recognition of susceptible cells. The outcomes of this research strongly appeal for in vivo trials of Hydroxychloroquine for the patients infected with Covid-19. Furthermore, the recommended doses of Hydroxychloroquine may reduce the chances of catching Covid-19 to the healthcare workers and staff who are in contact with or delivering direct care to coronavirus patients as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. We further hypothesize that the comparative S-protein-drug docking interactions may help to understand the comparative efficacy of other candidate repurposing drugs until discovery of a proper vaccine.	false
0	COVID-19: From bench to bed side. Background and aims: The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know. Method(s): We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics. Result(s): Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India	false

0	Indomethacin and resveratrol as potential treatment adjuncts for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The ongoing pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19) has led to unprecedented challenges for the global healthcare system. This novel coronavirus disease phenotype ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant cytokine storm with respiratory failure, polyorgan dysfunction, and death. Severe disease is characterized by exuberant inflammation resulting from high circulating cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These inflammatory mediators are responsible for the detrimental effects on the immune, hematologic, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal and other body systems. In addition to inhibition of viral replication, blunting this inflammatory response before overt cytokine storm is important to improve outcomes. Although there are upcoming promising agents such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, inexpensive, safe, and widely available adjunct treatments to ameliorate disease burden would be welcome. Two potential antiinflammatory agents include indomethacin, which has been shown in experimental models to decrease canine coronavirus (CCoV) levels in dogs and exhibit antiviral activity against several other viruses, and the polyphenol, resveratrol, a potent antioxidant that has shown antiviral activity against several viruses.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Positive SARS-Cov-2 test in a woman with COVID-19 at 22 days after hospital discharge: A case report. Background: In a few discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the nucleic acid test shows positive results again. Whether this is due to relapse of the disease, reinfection by the virus, or a false-positive result at hospital discharge is worth exploring. Case presentation: A woman with COVID-19 was discharged from the hospital after integrative treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine because she met the discharge standards. However, she obtained positive results on a nucleic acid test 22 days later. Conclusion(s): Based on this positive test result in a discharged patient with COVID-19, anal tests and coronavirus antibody tests should be combined with throat swab tests to further develop the diagnosis and discharge standards for patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Beijing University of Chinese Medicine	false
0	Corona virus (Covid-19) pandemic: A systematic review. The recently emerged CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) is now considered as a pandemic threat worldwide. It is novel class of virus that affects the respiratory tract and leads to difficulty in breathing. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans. It has been known to infect human hosts and cause respiratory diseases. Currently, there is still dearth of information on foremost source of viral transmission along with exact pathogenic mechanism of action. Besides this, the hospital outbreak of super-spreading virus has made a greater concern about global health due to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are highly pahogenic. There have been around 1,519,503 reported cases of coronavirus disease worldwide and 88,549 reported deaths along with 3,30,916 total recovered patients to date (9/4/2020).The disease is transmitted by inhalation of infected droplets .The symptoms are usually fever, sputum production, nasal congestion, pneumonia, sore throat,breathlessness. Diagnosis of disease is done by routine lab findings, specimen examination using RT-PCR and by using diagnostic kits. Prevention entails regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose and home isolation of suspected cases. Treatment is usually supportive of ayurvedic, herbal medicines and allopathic combinations mostly antiviral drugs. This revelation may exert crucial guidance for understanding the viral infection and measures to prevent and treat infection.Copyright © 2020 Pharmainfo Publications. All rights reserved.	false
0	Impact of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 degreeC), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = -0.0100, 95% CI: -0.0125, -0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Letter to the editor: efficacy of different methods of combination regimen administrations including dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and interferon-beta to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients: a structured summary of a study protocol for a r. OBJECTIVES: There is little information about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) management for critically ill patients. Most of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to excessive inflammatory response and the ensuing cytokine storm. Anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids can be used to effectively reduce the effect of this cytokine storm and lung damage. However, corticosteroids can have side effects, so simultaneous administration of immunoglobulin (IV-IG) and interferon-beta can help manage treatment using corticosteroids. Therefore, we designed a trial to test our hypothesis that early administration of dexamethasone in combination with IV-IG and interferon-beta can reduce the effect of the cytokine storm in critically ill patients COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms (1:1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) less than 90% and respiratory rate higher than 24 per minute or have involvement of more than 50% of their lung when viewed using computed tomography (CT)-scan. The age range of patients will be 18-70 years old. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: the need for intubation; allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study drug including dexamethasone, IV-IG, and interferon-beta; pregnancy or lactation; known HIV positive or active hepatitis B or C. The study will be conducted in several hospitals of the Golestan province, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The study subjects will be randomly allocated to three treatment arms: two experimental groups (two arms: Intervention 1 and Intervention 2) and one Control Group, which will be matched for age and sex using frequency matching method. Each eligible patient in the control arm will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 based on WHO guidelines and the Ministry of the Health and Medical Education (MOHME) of Iran. Each patient in the Intervention Group 1 will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 and dexamethasone, at the first 24 hours' time of admission. The intervention begins with the administration of dexamethasone based on the SpO2 levels. If the level of SpO2 does not improve after 24 hours, IV-IG (400 mg/kg once daily for 5 days) and interferon-beta (7 doses every other day) will be prescribed along with dexamethasone administration. In Intervention Group 2, the administration of dexamethasone will be started within the first 24 hours' time of admission and will be continued for 48-72 hours and then the SpO2 level will be checked. Then, if the level of SpO2 has not improved after that time, IV-IG and interferon-beta will be prescribed as the same dosage as Group 1. If the percentages of the SpO2 level are between 85 and 90/ 80 and 85/ 75 and 80/ less than 75, the dosages will be 4 mg every 12 hours/ 4 mg every 8 hours/ 8 mg every 12 hours/ 8 mg every 8 hours, respectively. According to the WHO recommendation, all participants will have the best available supportive care with full monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: An increase in the SpO2 level to reach more than 90% in each case, which will be assessed by the oximeter. Secondary: The duration of hospital stays; intubation status and the percentage of patients who are free of mechanical ventilation; the mortality rates during hospitalization and one month after the admission time. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated into either control or intervention groups with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a computer random number generator to generate a table of random numbers for simple randomization. BLINDING (MASKING): The project's principal investigator (PI) is unblinded. However, the PI will not analyse the data and interpret the results. An unblinded researcher (a pharmacist) will cover the drug's bottles with aluminium foil and prepare them interventions and control drugs in a syringe with a code so that patients are blinded. This person will have no patients contact. The staff and nurses, caring for the patients, will be unblinded for each study group due to the nature of this study. The staff that take outcome measurements will be blinded. The laboratory technicians will also be blinded as well as the statistical team. These study statisticians will have access to coded data and will analyse the data labelled as group X, group Y, and group Z. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size will be 105 critically ill COVID-19 patients, who will be allocated randomly to the three trial arms with 35 patients in each group. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment is ongoing. The study began on April 18 2020 and will be completed June 19 2020. This summary describes protocol version 1; April 2 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.irct.ir/. Identifier: IRCT20120225009124N4 version 1; Registration date: April 2 2020.

0	Mental health status of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in Jordan: A cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 global pandemic coupled with high transmission rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID-19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. RESULT(S): The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (>=1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. CONCLUSION(S): During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Virtual empathy and liver cancer. My first call was a 56 y/o male with hepatitis C-induced cirrhosis. He successfully cleared the virus with treatment and was very compliant with his surveillance ultrasounds for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Exactly the first day our institution, as most in the state, chose to close elective clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic I received the results from his magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confirming that the lesion in the previous week's ultrasound was indeed HCC. Video-visits were in the horizon but not yet available, so I had the task of explaining to him over the phone that this time the test showed he had cancer. I have gone through this process countless times, face to face in a ritual that involves silent moments while sensing the subtle feeling of fear in my patient's faces being covered by stoicism.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	What do surgeons need to know about the digestive disorders and paraclinical abnormalities induced by COVID-19?. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported. At first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients. The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images consistent with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	false
0	Seroprevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus in dromedaries and their traders in upper Egypt. Introduction: Camel trade in Egypt depends mainly on importation. Seemingly healthy imported camels are responsible for the ingress of serious diseases into Egypt. A striking example of this concerning public health globally is the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which causes case fatalities of over 34%. Here, we detennined the seroepidemiological situation of the MERS-CoV in imported camels and their traders in Upper Egypt. Methodology: Sera of sixty-three dromedaries and twenty-eight camel traders were recruited (January 2015-December 2016). The age, gender, and sampling locality of each sampled camel and human were obtained. Semi-quantitative anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISAs which utilize the purified spike protein domain Si antigen of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV S1) were used to detect specific IgG antibodies against the virus. Results: The data showed that 58.73% of imported camels and 25% of traders had antibodies specific to MERS-CoV. Interestingly, like seroreactive camels, all seropositive humans were apparently healthy without any history of developing severe respiratory disease in the 14 days prior to sampling. Having specific antibodies among the examined camel sera was significantly different (P < 0.0001) in relation to various sampling localities, gender and age groups. In contrast, the seropositivity rate of MERS-CoV IgG in humans did not differ significantly by any of the studied factors. Conclusions: The current study provides the first serological evidence of occupational exposure of humans to MERS-CoV in Africa. Additionally, it reports that imported camels could be implicated in introducing MERS-CoV into Egypt. Accordingly, application of strict control measures to camel importation is a priority.	false
0	Evolution and treatment of storm cytoquine syndrome associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection among octogenarians. Introduction: Cytokine storm syndrome (CTS) is a serious complication of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. Patients and method: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. Result(s): 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8 mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9 m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925 microg/L; P =.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76 mg / dL; P =.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727 microg/L, CRP of 27 mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18 mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. Conclusion(s): STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.Copyright © 2020 SEGG	false
0	Surface-PASylation of ferritin to form stealth nanovehicles enhances in vivo therapeutic performance of encapsulated ellipticine. Surface functionalisations substantially influence the performance of drug delivery vehicles by improving their biocompatibility, selectivity and circulation in bloodstream. Herein, we present the study of in vitro and in vivo behaviour of a highly potent cytostatic alkaloid ellipticine (Elli) encapsulated in internal cavity of ferritin (FRT)-based nanocarrier (hereinafter referred to as FRTElli). In addition, FRTElli surface was functionalised with three different molecular coatings: two types of protective PAS peptides (10- or 20-residues lengths) with sequences comprising amino acids proline (P), alanine (A) and serine (S) (to form PAS-10-FRTElli or PAS-20-FRTElli, respectively), or polyethylene glycol (PEG-FRTElli). All three surface modifications of FRT disposed sufficient encapsulation efficiency of Elli with no premature cumulative release of cargo. Noteworthy, all tested surface modifications displayed beneficial effects on the in vitro biocompatibility. PAS-10-FRTElli exhibited markedly reduced uptake by macrophages compared to PAS-20-FRTElli, PEG-FRTElli or unmodified FRTElli. The exceptional properties of PAS-10-FRTElli were validated by an array of in vitro analyses including formation of protein corona, uptake efficiency or screenings of selectivity of cytotoxicity. In murine preclinical model bearing triple -negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenograft, compared to free Elli or FRTElli, PAS-10-FRTElli displayed enhanced accumulation of Elli within tumour tissue, while hampering the uptake of Elli into off-target tissues. Noteworthy, PAS-10-FRTElli led to decreased in vivo complement (C3) activation and protein corona formation. Taken together, presented in vivo results indicate that PAS-10-FRTElli represents a promising stealth platform for translation into clinical settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

0	COVID-19 in a MS patient treated with ocrelizumab: does immunosuppression have a protective role?. Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world. It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Method(s): In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Result(s): Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred. Discussion(s): This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Targeted Immunosuppression Distinguishes COVID-19 from Influenza in Moderate and Severe Disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.	false
0	Human Plasma Protein Corona of Abeta Amyloid and Its Impact on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Cross-Seeding. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most severe form of neurological disorder, characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular tau tangles. For decades, therapeutic strategies against the pathological symptoms of AD have often relied on the delivery of monoclonal antibodies to target specifically Abeta amyloid or oligomers, largely to no avail. Abeta can be traced in the brain as well as in cerebrospinal fluid and the circulation, giving rise to abundant opportunities to interact with their environmental proteins. Using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, here we identified for the first time the protein coronae of the two major amyloid forms of Abeta-Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40-exposed to human blood plasma. Out of the proteins identified in all groups, 58 proteins were unique to the Abeta1-42 samples and 31 proteins unique to the Abeta1-40 samples. Both fibrillar coronae consisted of proteins significant in complement activation, inflammation, and protein metabolic pathways involved in the pathology of AD. Structure-wise, the coronal proteins often possessed multidomains of high flexibility to maximize their association with the amyloid fibrils. The protein corona hindered recognition of Abeta1-42 fibrils by their structurally specific antibodies and accelerated the aggregation but not the beta-cell toxicity of human islet amyloid polypeptide, the peptide associated with type 2 diabetes. This study highlights the importance of understanding the structural, functional, and pathological implications of the amyloid protein corona for the development of therapeutics against AD and a range of amyloid diseases.	false
0	Duplicate US1 Genes of Duck Enteritis Virus Encode a Non-essential Immediate Early Protein Localized to the Nucleus. The duplicate US1 genes of duck enteritis virus (DEV) encode a protein with a conserved Herpes_IE68 domain, which was found to be closely related to the herpes virus immediate early regulatory protein family and is highly conserved among counterparts encoded by Herpes_IE68 genes. Previous studies found the homologous proteins HSV-1 ICP22 and VZV ORF63/ORF70 to be critical for virus transcription and replication. However, little is known about the DEV ICP22 protein. In this paper, we describe the characteristics of this protein based on pharmacological experiments, real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays. We also investigate the role of the protein in DEV replication via mutation of US1. As a result, we found that the DEV ICP22 protein is a non-essential immediate early protein predominantly located in the nucleus of infected DEF cells and that DEV replication is impaired by US1 deletion. We also found that ICP22 contains a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) at 305-312AA, and ICP22 cannot enter the nucleus by itself after mutating residue 309.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Wu, Wang, Ma, Jia, Chen, Zhu, Liu, Yang, Zhao, Zhang, Huang, Ou, Mao, Zhang, Liu, Yu, Pan, Tian, Rehman, Chen and Cheng.	false
0	Standardization of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for serosurveys of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using clinical and at-home blood sampling. The extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the United States population is currently unknown. High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.	false
0	How to Handle a COVID-19 Patient in the Angiographic Suite. This is a single-center report on coordination of staff and handling of patients during the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in a region with high incidence and prevalence of disease. The selection of procedures for interventional radiology (IR), preparation of staff and interventional suite before the arrival of patients, the facility ventilation systems and intra- and post-procedural workflow optimization are described. The control measures described may increase the cost of the equipment, prolong procedural times and increase technical difficulties.

0	First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: A proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.Copyright © 2020	false

0	Management of acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Consensus Statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the American College of Emergency Physici. The worldwide pandemic caused by the novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in a new and lethal disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with this novel coronavirus. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury, and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on (a) varied clinical presentations; (b) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; (c) the roles of the emergency department, emergency medical system, and the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL); and (4) regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI-capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely manner, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI-capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.

0	Religion as a Health Promoter During the 2019/2020 COVID Outbreak: View from Detroit. The 2019/2020 COVID outbreak has surfaced as a global pandemic. The news has carried stories of the heroic efforts of medical and other health practitioners, with public health officials charting the course of spread. In an urban center like Detroit, the generosity of everyday citizens and church organizations has also played an important role. This inspection of the pandemic from the view of Detroit will examine the epidemiology of the coronavirus, translation of professional practice into people's awareness of the chronic disease risk factors which are prevalent in Detroit, moral and ethical views on the distribution of resources, and three major ways that religious faith has helped to sustain people's health and welfare in the midst of the broad social challenges posed by this novel coronavirus.	false
0	SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare personnel with high-risk occupational exposure: evaluation of seven-day exclusion from work policy. BACKGROUND: Starting in late February 2020, Greece is experiencing a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Healthcare personnel (HCP) were disproportionately affected, accounting for approximately 10% of notified cases. Exclusion from work for 7 days was recommended for HCP with high-risk occupational exposure. Our aim was to evaluate the 7-day exclusion from work policy for HCP with high-risk exposure., METHODS: HCP with a history of occupational exposure to COVID-19 were notified to the Hellenic National Public Health Organization, regardless of their exposure risk category. Exposed HCP were followed for 14 days after last exposure., RESULTS: We prospectively studied 3398 occupationally exposed HCP; nursing personnel accounted for most exposures (n=1705; 50.2%). Of the 3398 exposed HCP, 1599 (47.1%) were classified as low-risk, 765 (22.5%) as moderate-risk, and 1031 (30.4%) as high-risk exposures. Sixty-six (1.9%) HCP developed COVID-19 at a mean of 3.65 days (range: 0-17 days) post-exposure. Of the 66 HCP with COVID-19, 46, 7, and 13 had a history of high-, moderate- or low-risk exposure (4.5%, 0.9%, and 0.8% of all high-, moderate-, and low-risk exposures, respectively). Hospitalization and absenteeism were more prevalent among HCP with high-risk exposure. A logistic regression analysis showed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased risk for the onset of COVID-19: male, administrative personnel, underlying disease and high-risk exposure., CONCLUSION: HCP with high-risk occupational exposure to COVID-19 had increased probability of serious morbidity, healthcare seeking, hospitalization and absenteeism. Our findings justify the 7-day exclusion from work policy for HCP with high-risk exposure. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

It could result in serious distress and disability. Previous epidemic studies report high prevalence rates among people exposed to the trauma resulted from an infectious disease epidemic. While the control of the epidemic and care of patients with COVID-19 are still the dominant task of the whole world, this commentary calls for attention to early intervention and prevention of PTSD among huge numbers of COVID-19 survivors, their family members, health care professionals and other first-line helpers.

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can be diagnosed using RT-qPCR, but inadequate access to reagents and equipment has slowed disease detection and impeded efforts to mitigate viral spread. Alternative approaches based on combinations of isothermal amplification and CRISPR-mediated detection, such as the SHERLOCK ( S pecific H igh S ensitivity E nzymatic R eporter Un LOCK ing) technique, offer reduced dependence on RT-qPCR equipment, but previously reported methods required multiple fluid handling steps, complicating their deployment outside clinical labs. Here we developed a simple test chemistry called STOP (SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in one hour that is suitable for point-of-care use. This simplified test, STOPCovid, provides sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests and has a limit of detection of 100 copies of viral genome input in saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs per reaction. Using lateral flow readout, the test returns result in 70 minutes, and using fluorescence readout, the test returns result in 40 minutes. Moreover, we validated STOPCovid using nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and were able to correctly diagnose 12 positive and 5 negative patients out of 3 replicates. We envision that implementation of STOPCovid will significantly aid ""test-trace-isolate"" efforts, especially in low-resource settings, which will be critical for long-term public health safety and effective reopening of the society."	false
0	Comparison of immunogenicity between intradermal and intramuscular injections of repeated annual identical influenza virus strains post-pandemic (2011-2012) in COPD patients. We compared the antibody responses and persistence of the reduced-dose, 9 micro g hemagglutinin (HA)/strain intradermal (ID) injection via the Mantoux technique and the 15 mug HA/strain intramuscular (IM) injection of the repeated annual identical trivalent, inactivated, split-virion vaccine 2011-2012 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Eighty patients were randomized to ID (n = 41) and IM (n = 39) groups. Four weeks post-vaccination, the antibody responses of the two groups were similar; those for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2)-but not influenza B-met the criteria of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). The antibody responses for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 rapidly declined in both groups, especially with the ID injection, whereas those for influenza A(H3N2) maintained above the CPMP criteria throughout 12 months post-vaccination. The geometric mean titres for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 persisted above the protective threshold (>= 40) until 6 months post-vaccination in both the ID and IM groups. The seroprotection rates of the ID and IM groups were above 60% until 3 months and 6 months post-vaccination, respectively. In conclusion, the 9 mug HA/strain ID injection of vaccine 2011-2012 elicited antibody responses similar to the standard dose of 15 mug of the HA/strain IM injection at 4 weeks post-vaccination. However, the antibody responses for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 rapidly declined, especially in the case of the ID injection, whereas they were comparable for influenza A(H3N2). Additional strategies for increasing vaccine durability should be considered, especially for new pandemic strains affecting elderly COPD patients.	false
0	Persistent viral RNA positivity during the recovery period of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As an emerging infectious disease, the clinical course and virological course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain to be further investigated. In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the clinical course for more than 2 months. This patient had recovered from pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral-specific antibodies were produced during the recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva. In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral-specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 from the host's immune system. Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	false
0	Preliminary Data Related to the Effect of Climacostol Produced by the Freshwater Ciliate Climacostomum virens on Human Adenovirus. The new epidemiological scenario has so far focused on the environmental circulation of human viral pathogens. Owing to the side effects of chemical disinfectants, there is an increasing need for knowledge on the use of virucidal compounds, especially those of a natural origin. Climacostol is a molecule produced by a freshwater ciliate and it exhibits activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. We thus also speculated that there might be an effect on viral viability, which has never been tested. To evaluate such activity, we chose human adenovirus (HAdV), which is representative of waterborne viruses. We conducted experiments using HAdV serotype 5, whose titer was determined by infecting HeLa cell cultures. HAdV5 was shown to be sensitive to climacostol at a concentration of 0.0002 mg/mL, with an approximate 3 Log10 reduction when the initial titer of HAdV5 was approximately 104 and 103 TCID50/mL. These preliminary results could be an important starting point for further research aimed at improving the characterization of climacostol activity under different experimental conditions and against various viruses, including enveloped ones (i.e., the coronavirus). The production of climacostol by a protist living in fresh water also suggests a possible application in the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants.	false
0	COVID-19 infection may cause ketosis and ketoacidosis. This study included 658 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Forty-two (6.4%) out of 658 patients presented with ketosis on admission with no obvious fever or diarrhea. They had a median age of 47.0 years (IQR, 38.0-70.3), while 16 (38.1%) were men. Patients with ketosis were younger (median age: 47.0 vs 58.0 years, P = 0.003) and had greater prevalence of fatigue (31.0% vs 10.6%, P < 0.001), diabetes (35.7% vs 18.5%, P = 0.007), and digestive disorders (31.0% vs 12.0%, P < 0.001). However, they had longer length of hospital stay (19.0 [12.8-33.3] days vs 16.0 [10.0-24.0] days, P < 0.001) and higher mortality rate (21.4% vs 8.9%, P = 0.017). Three (20.0%) out of the 15 cases with diabetic ketosis developed acidosis, 5 cases (26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died, and one (25.0%) of the deaths presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) cases of the 27 non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died, respectively, and one (25.0%) of the deaths presented with acidosis. This suggested that COVID-19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis, and induced DKA for those patients with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. Meanwhile, diabetes increased the length of hospital stay for patients with ketosis but had no effect on their mortality. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Diabetes and covid-19: more than the sum of two morbidities. The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has caused a public health emergency worldwide. Risk, severity and mortality of the disease have been associated with non-communicable chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. Accumulated evidence has caused great concern in countries with high prevalence of this morbidity, such as Brazil. This text shows the picture of diabetes in Brazil, followed by epidemiological data and explanatory hypothesis for the association between diabetes and covid-19. We emphasized how the burden of these two morbidities in a middle-income country has aggravated this pandemic scenario. The comprehension of this association and biological plausibility may help face this pandemic and future challenges.	false
0	Potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs during COVID-19 crisis. Patients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications. Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population. However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization. Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency. Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.	false
0	ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Management of diabetes insipidus and hyponatraemia. COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counseling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatraemia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of the postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU, from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.	false
0	Population-scale Longitudinal Mapping of COVID-19 Symptoms, Behavior, and Testing Identifies Contributors to Continued Disease Spread in the United States. Despite social distancing and shelter-in-place policies, COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. A lack of timely information about factors influencing COVID-19 spread and testing has hampered agile responses to the pandemic. We developed How We Feel, an extensible web and mobile application that aggregates self-reported survey responses, to fill gaps in the collection of COVID-19-related data. How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users' health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self- reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self- reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, and behavioral self- reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.	false
0	Efficacy of Serology Testing in Predicting Reinfection in Patients with SARS-CoV-2. In many parts of the United States, SARS-CoV-2 cases have reached peak infection rates, prompting administrators to create protocols to resume elective cases. As elective procedures and surgeries get scheduled, ASCs must implement some form of widespread testing in order to ensure the safety of both the ASC staff as well as the patients being seen. The CDC recently announced the approval of new serological testing for SARS-CoV-2, a test that can indicate the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum against viral particles. However, the possibility for reinfection raises questions about the utility of this new serological test, as the presence of IgG may not correspond to long-term immunity. The coronavirus has been known to form escape mutations, which may correspond to reduction in immunoglobulin binding capacity. Patients who develop more robust immune responses with formation of memory CD8+ T-cells and helper CD4+ T-cells will be the most equipped if exposed to the virus, but unfortunately the serology test will not help us in distinguishing those individuals. Given the inherent disadvantages of serological testing, antibody testing alone should not be used when deciding patient care and should be combined with PCR testing.	false

Purpose: The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst global crisis after the Second World War. Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of the public, especially the high-risk groups, are critical to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 among patients with chronic disease., Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 chronic disease patients from March 02 to April 10, 2020, at Addis Zemen Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses with a 95% confidence interval were fitted to identify factors associated with poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used to determine the magnitude of the association between the outcome and independent variables. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant., Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.5+/-13.5. The prevalence of poor knowledge and poor practice was 33.9% and 47.3%, respectively. Forty-one percent of the participants perceived that avoiding of attending a crowded population is very difficult. Age (AOR=1.05, (95% CI (1.01-1.08)), educational status of ""can't read and write"" (AOR=7.1, 95% CI (1.58-31.93)), rural residence (AOR=19.0, 95% CI (6.87-52.66)) and monthly income (AOR=0.8, 95% CI (0.79-0.89)) were significantly associated with poor knowledge. Being unmarried (AOR=3.9, 95% CI (1.47-10.58)), cannot read and write (AOR=2.7, 95% CI (1.03-7.29)), can read and write (AOR=3.5, 95% CI (1.48-8.38)), rural residence (AOR=2.7, 95% CI (1.09-6.70)), income of <7252 Ethiopian birr (AOR=2.3, 95% CI (1.20-4.15)) and poor knowledge (AOR=8.6, 95% CI (3.81-19.45)) were significantly associated with poor practice., Conclusion: The prevalence of poor knowledge and poor practice was high. Leaflets prepared in local languages should be administered and health professionals should provide detailed information about COVID-19 to their patients. Copyright © 2020 Akalu et al."	false
0	[Prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19]. Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Method: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted from January 31st to February 5th at isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were divided into non-survival group and survival group according to the clinical outcomes 5 weeks after admission. Data including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results were obtained. Cardiac injury was defined as serum concentration of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) above 0.04 mug/L. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plotted survival curve and analyze the impact of myocardial injury on the survival outcome of COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 202 patients were included, the age was 63 (51, 70) years old, 88 (43.6%) of them were male, 85 (42.1%) of them had comorbidities, 125 (61.9%) of them were severely to critically ill. Till March 11, 33 patients died, all of them were critically ill patients. The age, proportion of males, comorbidities, respire rate, serum levels of hs-cTnI and incidence of heart failure in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P<0.05). The hospitalization time of non-survival group was significantly shorter than that of survival group (6(4, 9) vs. 32(23, 36), P<0.001). Myocardial injury was an important prognostic factor of COVID-19 (HR=5.382, 95%CI 2.404-12.05, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the presence of myocardial injury was significantly associated with the reduced survival rate among COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Conclusion: Myocardial injury is an important prognostic factor of COVID-19, COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of death.	false
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Genomic Observations and Emerging Therapies. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the disease COVID-19, first emerged in late December 2019 in China, and has subsequently become a pandemic with unprecedented clinical impact. The virus appears to more severely affect older individuals and those with co-morbid medical conditions, specifically those with chronic lung disease, obesity, heart failure and diabetes. Fortunately, children appear to be less severely affected, though mortality and severe disease have been reported. In addition, children's role in spreading the disease (potentially through asymptomatic shedding of the virus) remains an important area requiring further investigation. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the importance of metagenomic next generation sequencing as a tool for pandemic investigation. Though no proven therapeutic options currently exist, ongoing genomic and clinical trial data may help inform the identification and development of both repurposed and novel therapeutic agents for use in this disease.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.	false

There are few cases of pregnant women with novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) in the literature, most of them with a mild illness course. There is limited evidence about in utero infection and early positive neonatal testing. A 41-year-old G3P2 with a history of previous cesarean deliveries and diabetes mellitus presented with a 4-day history of malaise, low-grade fever, and progressive shortness of breath. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, COVID-19 serology was negative. The patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on day 5 of disease onset. The patient underwent a cesarean delivery, and neonatal isolation was implemented immediately after birth, without delayed cord clamping or skin-to-skin contact. The neonatal nasopharyngeal swab, 16hours after delivery, was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)-M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Maternal IgM and IgG were positive on postpartum day 4 (day 9 after symptom onset). We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 during pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported positive PCR in the neonate, raising the concern for vertical transmission. We suggest pregnant women should be considered as a high-risk group and minimize exposures for these reasons. KEY POINTS: . We report a severe presentation of COVID-19 in pregnancy requiring invasive ventilatory support.. . This is a case of positive RT-PCR in first day of life, suggesting possible vertical transmission.. . There were no detectable maternal antibodies for COVID-19 until after delivery..Copyright Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.	false

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (~4%) compared to health care professionals (~14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19., METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines., CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its ""LARGe ACTion"" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2020 L'Encephale, Paris. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

0	Environmental concern regarding the effect of humidity and temperature on 2019-nCoV survival: fact or fiction. The new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a new type of virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Environmental conditions necessary for survival and spread of 2019-nCoV are somewhat transparent but unlike animal coronaviruses. We are poorly aware of their survival in environment and precise factors of their transmission. Countries located in east and west of globe did not have a significant impact on prevalence of disease among communities, and on the other hand, north and south have provided a model for relative prediction of disease outbreaks. The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25 degreeC, and if this temperature rises to 30 degreeC, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%. Also, temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the COVID-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-nCoV transmission. Thus, considering the available and recent evidence, it seems that low temperatures, as well as dry and unventilated air, may affect stability and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.	false
0	COVID-19 and dermatology. Sars-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) was observed in China in the last months of 2019. In the following period, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: Skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and finally skin findings due to COVID- 19 treatment agents. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases and new skin lesion occurence / new skin disease occurence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could cause itch, dryness and contact dermatitis. Skin findings could also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The incidence of skin lesions because of COVID-19 was reported between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions such as maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain- like, thrombotic / ischemic etc. could be observed in COVID-19. Some authors state that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific skin finding is absent. But, especially in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition skin lesions could occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. As a result, many skin lesions could appear because of COVID-19. Even if there were no COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carrefully in this pandemic period. Key worlds: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, dermatology, skin findings.	false
0	Epidemiological and clinical features of 125 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Fuyang, Anhui, China. Objective: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China. Method(s): In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological findings of patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020. Result(s): Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16). Conclusion(s): In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development. Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6-16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants' level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (>=7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels >=7.5 muM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.

0	The Effect of Ligand Mobility on the Cellular Interaction of Multivalent Nanoparticles. Multivalent nanoparticle binding to cells can be of picomolar avidity making such interactions almost as intense as those seen with antibodies. However, reducing nanoparticle design exclusively to avidity optimization by the choice of ligand and its surface density does not sufficiently account for controlling and understanding cell-particle interactions. Cell uptake, for example, is of paramount significance for a plethora of biomedical applications and does not exclusively depend on the intensity of multivalency. In this study, it is shown that the mobility of ligands tethered to particle surfaces has a substantial impact on particle fate upon binding. Nanoparticles carrying angiotensin-II tethered to highly mobile 5 kDa long poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains separated by ligand-free 2 kDa short PEG chains show a superior accumulation in angiotensin-II receptor type 1 positive cells. In contrast, when ligand mobility is constrained by densely packing the nanoparticle surface with 5 kDa PEG chains only, cell uptake decreases by 50%. Remarkably, irrespective of ligand mobility and density both particle types have similar EC50 values in the 1-3 x 10-9 m range. These findings demonstrate that ligand mobility on the nanoparticle corona is an indispensable attribute to be considered in particle design to achieve optimal cell uptake via multivalent interactions.

0	Oropharyngeal Secretion as Alternative for SARS-CoV-2 Detection. This study aimed to determine if sampling of oropharyngeal secretions (OSs) helps improves detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification testing of potential patients with COVID-19. The first prospective study consisted of 75 patients with COVID-19 who were ready for discharge and who had 2 consecutive negative results per nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of viral samples retrieved with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs). Because of detection of potential false negatives in that cohort, the NAAT results of paired OS and NPS samples from 50 additional recruits with COVID-19 during their recovery stage were used in a second prospective study to compare the diagnostic values of the 2 viral RNA sampling methods. For identification of the frequency of inconsistency between the sampling methods, the McNemar's test was used for difference analysis and the kappa statistic for consistency analysis. OSs obtained from 2 of the 75 participants in the first study yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Both were male and aged >60 y. Subsequent chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassays indicated that they were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. For parallel NAAT of OS and NPS samples in the second study, McNemar's test indicated that the difference between the frequencies of inconsistent parts of OS and NPS was statistically significant (P = 0.021). Cohen's kappa coefficient for OS and NPS was 0.244, which is indicative of fair consistency. The NPS test has a risk of sending home more patients (59%) who still have the infection, while the OS test will make such an error in fewer patients (14%). Although OS sampling improves the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, it has to be emphasized that this conclusion is based on a very small sample size. Detection of viral RNA from a patient's secretions is not confirmative of viral infectivity.	false
0	COVID-19 and Cardiovascular Disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting 185 countries and >3 000 000 patients worldwide as of April 28, 2020. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which invades cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and >7% of patients experience myocardial injury from the infection (22% of critically ill patients). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 serves as the portal for infection, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers requires further investigation. COVID-19 poses a challenge for heart transplantation, affecting donor selection, immunosuppression, and posttransplant management. There are a number of promising therapies under active investigation to treat and prevent COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.	false
0	Sex differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that underlie disease outcomes. A growing body of evidence indicates sex differences in the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. However, whether immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 differ between sexes, and whether such differences explain male susceptibility to COVID-19, is currently unknown. In this study, we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients. By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.	false
0	Pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Emerging reports indicate a high incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia during the spring 2020 pandemic. The pronounced pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses observed in these patients may contribute to a transient hypercoagulable state. In this setting, pulmonary embolism may cause further respiratory distress and clinical deterioration., CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical course of three patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress, where pulmonary embolism was detected during the course of the hospitalisation. Two of the cases occurred despite early institution of standard dosage of low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis, and in one case, pulmonary embolism was diagnosed during the convalescent phase of an otherwise benign COVID-19 disease course., INTERPRETATION: These cases highlight the importance of awareness of the potentially increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 disease. Further research is required to establish appropriate clinical management guidelines for prevention of thromboembolic complications in COVID-19.	false
0	[COVID-19 infection in the elderly in French-speaking Switzerland: an inventory of beliefs, convictions and certainties]. Most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are aged over 70 years old, and half of those who die are over 83 years old. Older patients do not always present with typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnoea) but sometimes are and remain asymptomatic (contact screening), or have aspecific presentations (altered general condition, falls, delirium, unusual fatigue). Rectal swab, which minimizes exposition risk, appears useful in long-term care patients with diarrhea. Older age is associated with worse prognosis, but the analysis should be refined by means of prognostic indexes that account for the heterogeneous health, functional, and cognitive status of the elderly population. Gathering elderly patients' wishes and assessing their remaining life expectancy allows to anticipate care decisions according to the level of tension in the health system.	false
0	Management of Osteoarthritis During the COVID-19 Pandemic. The pandemic spread of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in China first, and all over the world at present, has become a global health emergency due to the rapidly increasing number of affected patients. Currently, a clear relationship between COVID-19 infection incidence and/or complications due to chronic or occasional treatments for other pathologies is still not clear, albeit the COVID-19 pandemic may condition the treatment strategy of complex disorders, such as osteoarthritis (OA). Importantly, OA is the most common age-related joint disease, affecting more than 80% of people older than the age of 55, an age burden also shared with the highest severity in COVID-19 patients. OA patients often show a large array of concomitant pathologies, such as diabetes, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases that are again shared with COVID-19 patients and may therefore increase complications. Moreover, different OA treatments, such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids, or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications. In this review we critically analyze the evidence on either negative or positive effects of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario. This would provide orthopedic surgeons in particular, and physicians, pharmacologists, and clinicians in general, a comprehensive description about the safety of the current pharmacological approaches and a decision-making tool to treat their OA patients as the coronavirus pandemic continues.

0	Optimizing Peripandemic Care for Veteran Major Non-Traumatic Lower Extremity Amputees: A Proposal Informed by a National Retrospective Descriptive Analysis of COVID-19 Risk Factor Prevalence. INTRODUCTION: In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vascular surgeons in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System have been undertaking only essential cases, such as advanced critical limb ischemia. Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999-2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via chi2-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort., RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1 +/- 10.4 years and 68.2 +/- 10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01)., CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.

0	Longitudinal Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Among Asymptomatic Staff in Five Colorado Skilled Nursing Facilities: Epidemiologic, Virologic and Sequence Analysis. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and has become a major global pathogen in an astonishingly short period of time. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 also has been notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. SNF residents tend to possess several risk factors for the most severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of long-term care facilities represent approximately 40 percent of US SARS-CoV-2 deaths. To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among SNF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we sampled workers weekly at five SNFs in Colorado using nasopharyngeal swabs, determined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus among these workers, and sequenced 48 nearly complete genomes. This manuscript reports results from the first five to six weeks of observation. Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic infection, a strong correlation between RNA detection and the presence of infectious virus in NP swabs, persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time. Our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to virus transmission within the workplace.	false
0	Rapid asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 during the incubation period demonstrating strong infectivity in a cluster of youngsters aged 16-23 years outside Wuhan and characteristics of young patients with COVID-19: A prospective contact-tracing study. Background: The outbreak of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan. Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available. Method(s): A cluster of 22 close-contacts of a 22-year-old male (Patient-Index) including youngsters with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized close-contacts testing negative for severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Anhui Province, China was prospectively-traced. Result(s): Since January 23, 2020, we enrolled a cluster of eight youngsters with COVID-19 (median age [range], 22 [16-23] years; six males) originating from Patient-Index returning from Wuhan to Hefei on January 19. Patient-Index visited his 16-year-old female cousin in the evening on his return, and met 15 previous classmates in a get-together on January 21. He reported being totally asymptomatic and were described by all his contacts as healthy on January 19-21. His very first symptoms were itchy eyes and fever developed at noon and in the afternoon on January 22, respectively. Seven youngsters (his cousin and six classmates) became infected with COVID-19 after a-few-hour-contact with Patient-Index. None of the patients and contacts had visited Wuhan (except Patient-Index), or had any exposure to wet-markets, wild-animals, or medical-institutes within three months. For affected youngsters, the median incubation-period was 2 days (range, 1-4). The median serial-interval was 1 day (range, 0-4). Half or more of the eight COVID-19-infected youngsters had fever, cough, sputum production, nasal congestion, and fatigue on admission. All patients had mild conditions. Six patients developed pneumonia (all mild; one bilateral) on admission. As of February 20, four patients were discharged. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2-infection presented strong infectivity during the incubation-period with rapid transmission in this cluster of youngsters outside Wuhan. COVID-19 developed in these youngsters had fast onset and various nonspecific atypical manifestations, and were much milder than in older patients as previously reported.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false

0	Co-circulation of multiple reassortant H6 subtype avian influenza viruses in wild birds in eastern China, 2016-2017. Background: H6 subtype influenza viruses were prevalent in domestic poultry and wild birds, which also could pose potential threat to humans. However, little is known about the prevalence of H6 subtype viruses in wild birds in eastern China, a crucial stopover or wintering site for migratory wild birds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Method(s): During the routine surveillance in 2016-2017, H6 subtype AIVs positive samples were identified, and the representative strains were selected for further sequence and phylogenetic analysis and the pathogenicity in mice were evaluated. Result(s): Among the 30 H6 positive samples, there were at least four subtypes H6N1, H6N2, H6N5 and H6N8 co-circulated in Shanghai, China. Genetic analysis showed the 8 representative isolates shared homology with different AIV sub-lineages isolated from domestic ducks or wild birds in different countries along the East Asian-Australasian flyways, and were classified into 7 new genotypes. The pathogenicity to mice showed that these H6 viruses could replicate efficiently in the lungs without prior adaptation, but could not cause mice death. Conclusion(s): Eight novel strains belonged to H6N1, H6N2, H6N5 and H6N8 subtypes were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple origins of internal genes indicative of robust reassortment events and frequent wild birds-poultry interaction encouraging the evolution and emergence of new genotypes. The pathogenicity to mammals should be closely monitored to prevent the emergence of novel pandemic viruses.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Clinically practiced and commercially viable nanobio engineered analytical methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has left the world clueless. As the WHO declares this new contagion as a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, the alarming rate of the spawn of the disease in such a short period has disarranged the globe. Standing against this situation researchers are strenuously searching for the key traits responsible for this pandemic. As knowledge regarding the dynamics and host-path interaction of COVID-19 causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently unknown, the formulation of strategies concerning antiviral treatment, vaccination, and epidemiological control stands crucial. Before designing adequate therapeutic strategies, it is extremely essential to diagnose the disease at the outset as early detection can have a greater impact on building health system capacity. Hence, a comprehensive review of strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis is essential in this existing global situation. In this review, sequentially, we have provided the clinical details along with genetic and proteomic biomarkers related to COVID-19. The article systematically enlightens a clear overview of the clinically adopted techniques for the detection of COVID-19 including oligonucleotide-based molecular detection, Point-of-Care immunodiagnostics, radiographical analysis/sensing system, and newly developed biosensing prototypes having commercial viability. The commercial kits/analytical methods based-sensing strategies have also been tabulated categorically. The critical insights on the developer, commercial brand name, detection methods, technical operational details, detection time, clinical specimen, status, the limit of detection/detection ability have been discussed comprehensively. We believe that this review may provide scientists, clinicians and healthcare manufacturers valuable information regarding the most recent developments/approaches towards COVID-19 diagnosis.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false

Background: The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) continues to wreck havoc across China, European countries, USA and now seems to gain a strong foothold in India. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical profiles of these Covid-19 infected patients admitted in Sawai Mansingh Hospital(S.M.S), Jaipur ranging from their age, sex, travel history, clinical symptoms, laboratory evaluation, radiological characteristics, treatment provided along with common side effects and the final outcome. The described cases are one of the earliest cases of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent., Methods: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA., Results and Discussion: During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment., Conclusion: Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.

0	Clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people. However, clinical research on its neurological manifestations is thus far limited. In this study, we aimed to systematically collect and investigate the clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in COVID-19. Method(s): Three medical (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and two preprints (BioRxiv and MedRxiv) databases were systematically searched for all published articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 since the outbreak. All included studies were systematically reviewed, and selected clinical data were collected for meta-analysis via random-effects. Result(s): A total of 41 articles were eligible and included in this review, showing a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. The meta-analysis for unspecific neurological symptoms revealed that the most common manifestations were fatigue (33.2% [23.1-43.3]), anorexia (30.0% [23.2-36.9]), dyspnea/shortness of breath (26.9% [19.2-34.6]), and malaise (26.7% [13.3-40.1]). The common specific neurological symptoms included olfactory (35.7-85.6%) and gustatory (33.3-88.8%) disorders, especially in mild cases. Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and meninges were repeatedly reported after COVID-19. Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological, and pathological evidence supported neurologic involvement of COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Neurological manifestations are various and prevalent in COVID-19. Emerging clinical evidence suggests neurological involvement is an important aspect of the disease. The underlying mechanisms can include both direct invasion and maladaptive inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted to explore the role of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 progression and to verify their underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 in infants and young children. Objective To study the clinical features and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in infants and young children. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020. Results All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. Conclusions Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children.Copyright © 2020 Xiangya Hospital of CSU. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A single arm meta-analysis. Objective: We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. Result(s): Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). Conclusion(s): Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false
0	A novel role of nifuroxazide in attenuation of sepsis-associated acute lung and myocardial injuries; role of TLR4/NLPR3/IL-1beta signaling interruption. Acute lung injury (ALI) and the subsequent multi-system organ failure is a serious health problem with devastating impacts on the health care systems. Indeed, the world has been facing an un-preceded situation in the past couple of months following COVID-19 infestation and the associated high-mortality rates mainly attributed to sepsis and the associated multiple organ failures of particular concern; acute respiratory distress syndrome post lung injury. The current study provides evidence on the ameliorative impact of nifuroxazide, and FDA approved antidiarrheal drug in attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and myocarditis when administrated either in prophylactic or curative regimens. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in lung and heart histopathological characteristics and architecture with retraction of LPS-induced inflammatory-infiltration. This was associated with retraction in serum biomarkers of cellular injury of which; LDH, CK-MB, and ALP. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in both lung and heart oxidative status. Such positive outcomes were underlined by a significant inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on lung and heart contents of toll-like receptor (4) (TLR4)/the inflammasome NALPR3/interleukin- 1beta (IL-1beta). In conclusion: Nifuroxazide attenuates LPS-induced ALI and myocardial injury via interruption of TLR4/NALPR3/IL-1beta signaling. Thus it can offer a potential approach for attenuation of sepsis in critically ill patients.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	Clinical features of 1487 COVID-19 patients with outpatient management in the Greater Paris: the COVID-call study. Clinical features of COVID-19 have been mostly described in hospitalized patients with and without ICU admission. Yet, up to 80% of patients are managed in an outpatient setting. This population is poorly documented. In France, health authorities recommend outpatient management of patients presenting mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The aim of this study was to describe their clinical characteristics. The study took place in an emergency medical dispatching center located in the Greater Paris region. Patients included in this survey met confirmed COVID-19 infection criteria according to the WHO definition. We investigated clinical features and classified symptoms as general, digestive, ear-nose-throat, thoracic symptoms, and eye disease. Patients were included between March 24 and April 6 2020. 1487 patients included: 700 (47%) males and 752 (51%) females, with a median age of 44 (32-57) years. In addition to dry cough and fever reported in more than 90% of cases, the most common symptoms were general symptoms: body aches/myalgia (N=845; 57%), headache (N=824; 55%), and asthenia (N=886; 60%); shortness of breath (N=479; 32%) and ear-nose-throat symptoms such as anosmia (N=415; 28%) and ageusia (N=422; 28%). Chest pain was reported in 320 (21%) cases and hemoptysis in 41 (3%) cases. The main difference between male and female patients was an increased prevalence of ear-nose-throat symptoms as well as diarrhea, chest pains, and headaches in female patients. General symptoms and ear-nose-throat symptoms were predominant in COVID-19 patients presenting mild-to-moderate symptoms. Shortness of breath and chest pain were remarkably frequent.	false

0	Protective immunity after COVID-19 has been questioned: What can we do without SARS-CoV-2-IgG detection?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome that is called COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG. Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity. The T cells studies can be helpful in elucidating the pathways for development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVID-19 and for filling these immunology knowledge gaps.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	White Matter Integrity in Tanzanian Children With Sickle Cell Anemia: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study. Background and Purpose - Widespread reductions in white matter integrity are associated with cognitive dysfunction in sickle cell anemia. Silent cerebral infarction (SCI), vasculopathy (VSC), and low hemoglobin concentration (Hb) are implicated; we aimed to determine independent contributions to microstructural white matter injury and whether white matter integrity differs across arterial territories. Methods- Sixty two children with sickle cell anemia aged 6 to 19 years were prospectively studied at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCI+/- and VSC+/- were identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans by 2 neuroradiologists. Tract-based spatial statistics tested for voxel-wise differences in diffusion tensor imaging metrics (ie, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) between SCI+/- and VSC+/- groups, with correlations between diffusion tensor imaging metrics and Hb. In tract-based spatial statistics analyses, potentially mediating factors (ie, age, sex, as well as Hb, SCI, and/or vasculopathy) were covariates. Differences in mean diffusion tensor imaging metrics across regions of interest in arterial territories were explored. Results - Compared with SCI- patients (n=45), SCI+ patients (n=17) exhibited increased radial diffusivity in multiple regions; negative relationships were observed between mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and Hb (P<0.005). Compared with VSC- patients (n=49), mild (n=6) or moderate (n=7) VSC+ patients exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy in widespread regions (P<0.05) including the anterior longitudinal fasciculi, corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata, and corticospinal tracts. Overall, the posterior cerebral arterial territory had higher mean mean diffusivity and mean radial diffusivity than the anterior and middle cerebral arterial territories, although no patient had vasculopathy in this area. There was an interaction between territory and vasculopathy. Conclusions - SCI, vasculopathy, and Hb are independent risk factors, and thus treatment targets, for diffuse white matter injury in patients with sickle cell anemia. Exacerbation of hemodynamic stress may play a role.	false
0	Lopinavir/ritonavir as a third agent in the antiviral regimen for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Corona Virus Disease (CoVID-19) is an emerging public health problem rapidly spread globally. New treatment options for patients with severe symptoms and ways of reducing transmission in the community are taken into consideration. A retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Alexandroupolis (Greece) including 16 patients with CoVID-19. They were classified into two groups, A and B. Group A received lopinavir/ritonavir as a third agent in the antiviral regimen, while group B did not. Lymphocytes were more significantly increased in patients of group A. Ferritin serum levels were also decreased significantly in these patients. Number of days needed for a first negative result of Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was lower for Group A. The present study suggests that lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce the viral carriage in a shorter period of time compared with other antiviral regimens. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Edizioni Scientifi che per l'Informazione su Farmaci e Terapia.	false
0	Potently neutralizing human antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding and protect animals. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major threat to global health for which there are only limited medical countermeasures, and we lack a thorough understanding of mechanisms of humoral immunity 1,2 . From a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike (S) glycoprotein isolated from the B cells of infected subjects, we identified several mAbs that exhibited potent neutralizing activity with IC 50 values as low as 0.9 or 15 ng/mL in pseudovirus or wild-type ( wt ) SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests, respectively. The most potent mAbs fully block the receptor-binding domain of S (S RBD ) from interacting with human ACE2. Competition-binding, structural, and functional studies allowed clustering of the mAbs into defined classes recognizing distinct epitopes within major antigenic sites on the S RBD . Electron microscopy studies revealed that these mAbs recognize distinct conformational states of trimeric S protein. Potent neutralizing mAbs recognizing unique sites, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, bound simultaneously to S and synergistically neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. In two murine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of either COV2-2916 or COV2-2130 alone or a combination of both mAbs protected mice from severe weight loss and reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lung. These results identify protective epitopes on the S RBD and provide a structure-based framework for rational vaccine design and the selection of robust immunotherapeutic cocktails.	false
0	Endoscopic Findings in Patients Infected With 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Lombardy, Italy. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major worldwide threat caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly spreading to a global pandemic. As of May 11, 2020, 4,176,346 cases have been reported worldwide, 219,814 in Italy, and of them, 81,871 occurred in the Lombardy region.1 Although the respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 have been widely described, the impact on the gastrointestinal (GI) system remains less clear. The reported prevalence of digestive symptoms ranges from 3% to 79%, depending on the setting,2-5 but data on GI endoscopic and histologic findings in COVID-19 patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the GI endoscopic and histologic findings in COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2020 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	false
0	Does Early Childhood Vaccination Protect Against COVID-19?. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an on-going pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which targets the respiratory system of humans. The published data show that children, unlike adults, are less susceptible to contracting the disease. This article aims at understanding why children constitute a minor group among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here, we hypothesize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine could provide a broad neutralizing antibody against numbers of diseases, including COVID-19. Our hypothesis is based on the 30 amino acid sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein (PDB: 6VSB) of both the measles virus fusion (F1) glycoprotein (PDB: 5YXW_B) and the rubella virus envelope (E1) glycoprotein (PDB: 4ADG_A). Computational analysis of the homologous region detected the sequence as antigenic epitopes in both measles and rubella. Therefore, we believe that humoral immunity, created through the MMR vaccination, provides children with advantageous protection against COVID-19 as well, however, an experimental analysis is required.

0	Glycyrrhetinic acid alleviates hepatic inflammation injury in viral hepatitis disease via a HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway. Various human disorders are cured by the use of licorice, a key ingredient of herbal remedies. Glycyrrhizic acid (GL), a triterpenoid glycoside, is the aqueous extract from licorice root. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has been reported to be a major bioactive hydrolysis product of GL and has been regarded as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases, including hepatitis. However, the mechanism by which GA inhibits viral hepatic inflammatory injury is not completely understood. In this study, we found that, by consecutively treating mice with a traditional herbal recipe, licorice plays an important role in the detoxification of mice. We also employed a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection model to illustrate that GA treatment inhibited activation of hepatic inflammatory responses by blocking high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) cytokine activity. Furthermore, decreased HMGB1 levels and downstream signaling triggered by injection of a neutralizing HMGB1 antibody or TLR4 gene deficiency, also significantly protected against MHV-induced severe hepatic injury. Thus, our findings characterize GA as a hepatoprotective therapy agent in hepatic infectious disease not only by suppressing HMGB1 release and blocking HMGB1 cytokine activity, but also via an underlying viral-induced HMGB1-TLR4 immunological regulation axis that occurs during the cytokine storm. The present study provides a new therapy strategy for the treatment of acute viral hepatitis in the clinical setting.Copyright © 2020	false
0	'Quit During COVID-19'-staying smokefree in mental health in-patient settings. Cigarette smoking is one of the main preventable causes of cancers globally. At this time of global emergency, mental health professionals all over the world are joining hands with the public health and other healthcare communities to focus on acute measures to save lives from COVID-19. This has been particularly challenging in mental health hospital settings where numerous additional factors need to be considered, including difficulties of implementing social distancing, potential impacts of social isolation, increased stress levels and implications of all this on smoking. In this article, we will briefly discuss the prevalence of smoking in mental health patients, especially in those in mental health hospital settings and also what is the possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic in these people. Then we will go through the main reasons as to why encouraging smoking cessation in mental health patients is so important and measures we can take for supporting mental health patients quit smoking even during COVID-19 times. The smoking cessation interventions have a direct bearing on preventing future cancers and achieving smoking cessation among cancer patients in this already disadvantaged group.

0	G6PD variant distribution in sub-Saharan Africa and potential risks of using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine based treatments for COVID-19. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine have been proposed as potential treatments for COVID-19. These drugs have warning labels for use in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data of 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa showed significant G6PD variation across the continent. We identified nine variants, of which four are potentially deleterious to G6PD function, and one (rs1050828) that is known to cause G6PD deficiency. We supplemented data for the rs1050828 variant with genotype array data from over 11,000 Africans. Although this variant is common in Africans overall, large allele frequency differences exist between sub-populations. African sub-populations in the same country can show significant differences in allele frequency (e.g. 16.0% in Tsonga vs 0.8% in Xhosa, both in South Africa, rho=2.4x10 -3 ). The high prevalence of variants in the G6PD gene found in this analysis suggests that it may be a significant interaction factor in clinical trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 in Africans.	false
0	COVID-19 and online teaching in higher education: A case study of Peking University. Starting from the spring of 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 caused Chinese universities to close the campuses and forced them to initiate online teaching. This paper focuses on a case of Peking University's online education. Six specific instructional strategies are presented to summarize current online teaching experiences for university instructors who might conduct online education in similar circumstances. The study concludes with five high-impact principles for online education: (a) high relevance between online instructional design and student learning, (b) effective delivery on online instructional information, (c) adequate support provided by faculty and teaching assistants to students; (d) high-quality participation to improve the breadth and depth of student's learning, and (e) contingency plan to deal with unexpected incidents of online education platforms.

0	"Harnessing the immune system via FcgammaR function in immune therapy: a pathway to next-gen mAbs. The human fragment crystallizable (Fc)gamma receptor (R) interacts with antigen-complexed immunoglobulin (Ig)G ligands to both activate and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens. More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcgammaR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a ""scaffolding"" role for FcgammaR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcgammaR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcgammaRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent ""next-gen"" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcgammaRs or the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcgammaR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FcgammaR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice, income, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urologists. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice, income, health and lifestyle behavior of Brazilian urologists during the month of April 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 39-question, web-based survey was sent to all urologist members of the Brazilian Society of Urology. We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. RESULT(S): Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction >= 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of >= 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p< 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95%CI 1.74-10.54, p=0.012). CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.

0	Coronavirus in water environments: Occurrence, persistence and concentration methods - A scoping review. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23degreeC-25 degreeC than at 4 degreeC); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	false
0	Systematic rapid living review on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19: update to April 30th 2020. BACKGROUND: This paper adds to the series of systematic rapid living reviews, started in April 2020, to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): To present the results of a systematic scientific literature search performed on papers published from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. METHOD(S): A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, Web of Science and the main international guideline databases for articles published (including Epub), in English, from April 1st to April 30th, 2020. Papers were included if they reported on one of the following: 1) prevalence and features of the emerging disability after Covid-19; 2) rehabilitation strategies applied for Covid-19 patients, regardless of setting or stage; 3) information about rehabilitation services after Covid-19; 4) impact on diseases of rehabilitative interest; 5) complications of rehabilitative interest. RESULT(S): Out of 445 articles retrieved for the time frame, 50 were finally included for qualitative analysis. They consist of 7 guidelines, 1 scoping review, 1 randomized controlled trial, 4 descriptive studies (qualitative), 1 case series, 1 case report, and 35 expert opinions. CONCLUSION(S): This systematic rapid living review showed an increasing evidence on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19 outbreak during April 2020. The main novelties include: 1) the first appearance of epidemiological data on the likely high incidence of neurological complications/disabling sequelae in patients hospitalized for COVID-19; 2) rapid guidelines on the management of chronically disabled patients in the COVID-19 era; 3) advices to provide COVID-19 patients with early respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase, and with telemonitoring and telerehabilitation in the post-acute phase. Although the overall quality of studies has increased, prospective cohort studies on disability course in COVID-19 pandemic and experimental studies on the effects of rehabilitation are still warranted.	false
0	Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters of a severe COVID-19 case. Background: Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other countries and regions. Method(s): We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days. Result(s): Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased. On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values. From 8 to 14 days of admission, the patient's condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly. On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased. Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis. In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease. Conclusion(s): Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses. Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.	false
0	Neurological involvement of coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review. Background: In December 2019, unexplained cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, which were found to be secondary to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak, a pandemic. Objective(s): To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. Method(s): We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. Result(s): We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. Conclusion(s): Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options. Physicians should be cautious not to overlook other neurological diagnoses that can mimic COVID-19 during the pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Positive rectal swabs in young patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To investigate the widely concerned issue about positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results after discharge in patients recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): We identified seven cases of COVID-19 who was readmitted to hospital because of positive RT-PCR after discharge, including three pediatrics and four young adult patients. Result(s): Six patients had positive rectal swabs but negative throat swabs, and one patient had positive throat swabs. All the patients continued to be asymptomatic and had unchanged chest computed tomography from previous images. The time from hospital discharge to positive RT-PCR after recovery was 7-11 days. The time from positive to negative rectal swabs was 5-23 days. Conclusion(s): The study might suggest the positive RT-PCR after recovery did not mean disease relapse or virus reinfection. Adding RT-PCR test of rectal swabs to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine might be necessary.Copyright © 2020 The British Infection Association	false
0	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Mimicking as Pulmonary Tuberculosis in an Inmate. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global infectious disease with emerging medical knowledge. Clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is very variable amongst patients, and the literature about unusual presentations is growing rapidly. This lack of knowledge leads to diagnostic, therapeutic, and management challenges in such patients. Here, we describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a low prevalence area which was initially diagnosed and managed as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a high-risk inmate population. These ambiguous presentations can lead to mismanagement of such patients resulting in potentially fatal outcomes and public health crises in confined facilities. This also highlights the significance of a high index of clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 especially in high risk and vulnerable populations. Copyright © 2020, Akbar et al.	false
0	Therapeutic Potential of B-1a Cells in COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory illness caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its clinical presentation can vary from the asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Due to our insufficient understanding of its pathophysiology and lack of effective treatment, the morbidity and mortality of severe COVID-19 patients are high. Patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS fueled by exaggerated neutrophil influx into the lungs and cytokine storm. B-1a cells represent a unique subpopulation of B lymphocytes critical for circulating natural antibodies, innate immunity, and immunoregulation. These cells spontaneously produce natural IgM, interleukin (IL)-10, and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Natural IgM neutralizes viruses and opsonizes bacteria, IL-10 attenuates the cytokine storm, and GM-CSF induces IgM production by B-1a cells in an autocrine manner. Indeed, B-1a cells have been shown to ameliorate influenza virus infection, sepsis, and pneumonia, all of which are similar to COVID-19. The recent discovery of B-1a cells in humans further reinforces their potentially critical role in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and their anticipated translational applications against viral and microbial infections. Given that B-1a cells protect against ARDS via immunoglobulin production and the anti-COVID-19 effects of convalescent plasma treatment, we recommend that studies be conducted to further examine the role of B-1a cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and explore their therapeutic potential to treat COVID-19 patients.	false
0	Features of Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 Patients With Dysphonia. Introduction: To explore the prevalence of dysphonia in European patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and the clinical features of dysphonic patients. Method(s): The clinical and epidemiological data of 702 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were collected from 19 European Hospitals. The following data were extracted: age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco consumption, comorbidities, general, and otolaryngological symptoms. Dysphonia and otolaryngological symptoms were self-assessed through a 4-point scale. The prevalence of dysphonia, as part of the COVID-19 symptoms, was assessed. The outcomes were compared between dysphonic and nondysphonic patients. The association between dysphonia severity and outcomes was studied through Bayesian analysis. Result(s): A total of 188 patients were dysphonic, accounting for 26.8% of cases. Females developed more frequently dysphonia than males (P = 0.022). The proportion of smokers was significantly higher in the dysphonic group (P = 0.042). The prevalence of the following symptoms was higher in dysphonic patients compared with nondysphonic patients: cough, chest pain, sticky sputum, arthralgia, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The severity of dyspnea, dysphagia, ear pain, face pain, throat pain, and nasal obstruction was higher in dysphonic group compared with nondysphonic group. There were significant associations between the severity of dysphonia, dysphagia, and cough. Conclusion(s): Dysphonia may be encountered in a quarter of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and should be considered as a symptom list of the infection. Dysphonic COVID-19 patients are more symptomatic than nondysphonic individuals. Future studies are needed to investigate the relevance of dysphonia in the COVID-19 clinical presentation.Copyright © 2020 The Voice Foundation	false
0	Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial. BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULT(S): Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION(S): Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.Copyright © 2020.

0	SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically overt SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases residing in Tuscany, and to compare it with that observed in the general Tuscan population. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. Result(s): 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab). Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications. Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20-0.21%), p = .597]. Conclusion(s): Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety. With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections-SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012-both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by beta-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	COVID-19: A recommendation to examine the effect of mouthrinses with beta-cyclodextrin combined with citrox in preventing infection and progression. Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations. Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission. If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain beta-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage. We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of betaCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

0	Commentary: Could iron chelators prove to be useful as an adjunct to COVID-19 Treatment Regimens?. The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to global health. Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	Colchicine's effects on metabolic and inflammatory molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome: results from a pilot randomized controlled trial. Objective: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that colchicine may have metabolic and cardiovascular and benefits in at-risk patients; however, the mechanisms through which colchicine may improve outcomes are still unclear. We sought to examine colchicine's effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Method(s): Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. Result(s): At baseline, age (48.0 +/- 13.8 vs. 44.7 +/- 10.3 years) and BMI (39.8 +/- 6.4 vs. 41.8 +/- 8.2 kg/m2) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. Conclusion(s): In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects. Further research is warranted to investigate whether colchicine's IL-6 suppressive effects may be beneficial in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, US GOVT.	false
0	Prevalence of Taste and Smell Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019. Importance: Early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may help control the diffusion of the disease into the population. Objective(s): To investigate the presence of sinonasal manifestations at the onset of COVID-19 to achieve an earlier diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This retrospective telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalized or discharged from a single referral center. Patients who were unable to answer (intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased) or unreachable by telephone were excluded. Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and 3 refused. Exposures: Sinonasal manifestations reported before COVID-19 diagnosis were studied with a validated questionnaire: Italian Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (I-SNOT-22). If reduction of taste and/or smell was documented by item 5 of the I-SNOT-22, further inquiries were made to score them separately on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no problem and 5 indicating problem as bad as it can be. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of sinonasal manifestations preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. Result(s): Among the 204 patients enrolled (110 [53.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 52.6[14.4] years), the median I-SNOT-22 total score was 21 (range, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 identified 116 patients (56.9%) with reduction of taste and/or smell, 113 (55.4%) with taste reduction (median score, 5; range, 2-5), and 85 (41.7%) with smell reduction (median score, 5; range, 1-5). Eighty-two patients (40.2%) reported both. Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7%), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3%). Only 12 patients (14.8%) with severe taste reduction and 12 patients (16.7%) with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. Severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female vs male patients (odds ratios, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] vs 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) and middle-aged vs younger patients (effect sizes, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). No significant association was observed between smoking habits and severe reduction of taste (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) and/or smell (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this telephone survey study suggest that reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of COVID-19. Nasal obstruction was not commonly present at the onset of the disease in this study. The general practitioner may play a pivotal role in identifying potential COVID-19 in patients at an early stage if taste and/or smell alterations manifest and in suggesting quarantine before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.	false

0	"CT Manifestations and Clinical Characteristics of 1115 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Rationale and Objectives: We aimed to assess the prevalence of significant computed tomographic(CT) manifestations and describe some notable features based on chest CT images, as well as the main clinical features of patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed to identify studies assessing CT features, clinical, and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients. A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Result(s): A total of 14 articles (including 1115 patients) based on chest CT images were retrieved. In the lesion patterns on chest CTs, we found that pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) (69%, 95% CI 58-80%), consolidation (47%, 35-60%) and ""air bronchogram sign"" (46%, 25-66%) were more common than the atypical lesion of ""crazy-paving pattern"" (15%, 8-22%). With regard to disease extent and involvement, 70% (95% CI 46-95%) of cases showed a location preference for the right lower lobe, 65% (58-73%) of patients presented with >=3 lobes involvement, and meanwhile, 42% (32-53%) of patients had involvement of all five lobes, while 67% (55-78%) of patients showed a predominant peripheral distribution. An understanding of some important CT features might be helpful for medical surveillance and management. In terms of clinical features, muscle soreness (21%, 95% CI 15-26%) and diarrhea (7%, 4-10%) were minor symptoms compared to fever (80%, 74-87%) and cough (53%, 33-72%). Conclusion(s): Chest CT manifestations in patients with COVID-19, as well as its main clinical characteristics, might be helpful in disease evolution and management.Copyright © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists"	false

0	The Importance of Advancing SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Children. While the role of children in the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be fully defined, they likely play an important role based on our knowledge of other respiratory viruses. Children are more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms and less likely to present for healthcare and be tested for SARS-CoV-2; thus, our current estimates are likely under-representative of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Given the potential direct benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and the substantial indirect benefit through community protection or 'herd immunity', we argue that planning and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should include children. Furthermore, community protection occurred after widespread implementation of prior childhood vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, rubella and rotavirus. We detail considerations for vaccine clinical trials, potential barriers to the implementation of widespread vaccination and argue why children would be an ideal target population for vaccination.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Coronavirus surveillance of wildlife in the Lao People's Democratic Republic detects viral RNA in rodents. Coronaviruses can become zoonotic, as in the case of COVID-19, and hunting, sale, and consumption of wild animals in Southeast Asia increases the risk for such incidents. We sampled and tested rodents (851) and other mammals and found betacoronavirus RNA in 12 rodents. The sequences belong to two separate genetic clusters and are closely related to those of known rodent coronaviruses detected in the region and distantly related to those of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Considering the close human-wildlife contact with many species in and beyond the region, a better understanding of virus diversity is urgently needed for the mitigation of future risks.	false
0	Estimating excess 1-year mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic according to underlying conditions and age: a population-based cohort study. Background: The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. Method(s): In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0.001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. Finding(s): We included 3 862 012 individuals (1 957 935 [50.7%] women and 1 904 077 [49.3%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13.7% were older than 70 years and 6.3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4.46% (95% CI 4.41-4.51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1.5, four with an RR of 2.0, and seven with an RR of 3.0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18 374 excess deaths with an RR of 1.5, 36 749 with an RR of 2.0, and 73 498 with an RR of 3.0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146 996 excess deaths with an RR of 1.5, 293 991 with an RR of 2.0, and 587 982 with an RR of 3.0. Interpretation(s): We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

0	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Sars cov-2) in dentistry. management of biological risk in dental practice. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, and the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Flugge micro droplets or core droplets that remain suspended as aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus. Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak. Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection). This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices.

0	Evaluation of two automated and three rapid lateral flow immunoassays for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Introduction: Several SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been developed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Method(s): Two quantitative automated immunoassays (MaglumiTM2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. Result(s): MaglumiTM IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4 % versus 64.3 %). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99 % and 100 %, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70 %) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91 %-94 %) after 14 days. Conclusion(s): This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Lipase Elevation in Patients With COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Although coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with gastrointestinal manifestations, its effect on the pancreas remains unclear. We aimed to assess the frequency and characteristics of hyperlipasemia in patients with COVID-19. METHOD(S): A retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients across 6 US centers with COVID-19. RESULT(S): Of 71 patients, 9 (12.1%) developed hyperlipasemia, with 2 (2.8%) greater than 3 times upper limit of normal. No patient developed acute pancreatitis. Hyperlipasemia was not associated with poor outcomes or symptoms. DISCUSSION: Although a mild elevation in serum lipase was observed in some patients with COVID-19, clinical acute pancreatitis was not seen.	false
0	Incidental COVID-19 related lung apical findings on stroke CTA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background Authors have noticed an increase in lung apex abnormalities on CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck performed for stroke workup during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective To evaluate the incidence of these CTA findings and their relation to COVID-19 infection. Methods In this retrospective multicenter institutional review board-approved study, assessment was made of CTA findings of code patients who had a stroke between March 16 and April 5, 2020 at six hospitals across New York City. Demographic data, comorbidities, COVID-19 status, and neurological findings were collected. Assessment of COVID-19 related lung findings on CTA was made blinded to COVID-19 status. Incidence rates of COVID-19 related apical findings were assessed in all code patients who had a stroke and in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Results The cohort consisted of a total of 118 patients with mean+/-SD age of 64.9+/-15.7 years and 57.6% (68/118) were male. Among all code patients who had a stroke, 28% (33/118) had COVID-19 related lung findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in 93.9% (31/33) of these patients with apical CTA findings. Among patients who had a stroke confirmed by imaging, 37.5% (18/48) had COVID-19 related apical findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in all (18/18) of these patients with apical findings. Conclusion The incidence of COVID-19 related lung findings in stroke CTA scans was 28% in all code patients who had a stroke and 37.5% in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Stroke teams should closely assess the lung apices during this COVID-19 pandemic as CTA findings may be the first indicator of COVID-19 infection.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	"COVID-19 and dental practice: Overview and protocols during pandemic. In December 2019, in Wuhan (China), there were described the first cases of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 and named COVID-19. Since then the disease has spread in several countries and in March 2020 the WHO declared it pandemic. COVID-19 is associated with a wide range of manifestations from no symptoms to temperature cough, dyspnea, need for artificial ventilation and eventually death. Mortality has been reported to be around 3%. Cases of spreading from asymptomatic infected individuals have been documented. It has become clear that among healthcare professionals, dentists are the most exposed category to the risk of such infection as the routes of transmission are contact, droplets and aerosol, therefore the necessity of providing clear guidelines has suddenly arisen. This article is aimed at analysing the available literature about ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""COVID-19"", and comparing it with the guidelines for other coronavirus infections and dental practice with a view to providing clinical recommendations about prevention and infection control in the dental environment.Copyright © 2020 Masson SpA.

0	Prevalence of hospital PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in patients with chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Background: The susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases and the risks or benefits of immunosuppressive therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Rates of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. Result(s): Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Patients with systemic autoimmune or immune-mediated disease (AI/IMID) showed a significant increase, whereas patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. Patients with IA on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but not those on conventional-synthetic DMARDs, had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. Conclusion(s): Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of ageing, therapies and disease-specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyse the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.

0	Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during the covid-19 pandemic in Paris, France: prospective observational study. OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of children and adolescents affected by an outbreak of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and to evaluate a potential temporal association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: General paediatric department of a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: 21 children and adolescents (aged <=18 years) with features of Kawasaki disease who were admitted to hospital between 27 April and 11 May 2020 and followed up until discharge by 15 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical and biological data, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment, and outcomes. Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies to the virus. RESULT(S): 21 children and adolescents (median age 7.9 (range 3.7-16.6) years) were admitted with features of Kawasaki disease over a 15 day period, with 12 (57%) of African ancestry. 12 (57%) presented with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and 16 (76%) with myocarditis. 17 (81%) required intensive care support. All 21 patients had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms during the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 19 (90%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR result in 8/21, positive IgG antibody detection in 19/21). All 21 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 10 (48%) also received corticosteroids. The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 (24%) of the patients during hospital stay. By 15 May 2020, after 8 (5-17) days of hospital stay, all patients were discharged home. CONCLUSION(S): The ongoing outbreak of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children and adolescents in the Paris area might be related to SARS-CoV-2. In this study an unusually high proportion of the affected children and adolescents had gastrointestinal symptoms, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and were of African ancestry.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

0	Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: Analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017. Objectives To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province. Design National surveillance studies, 2008-17. Setting 31 provinces in mainland China. Participants 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. Main outcome measures Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. Results From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. Conclusions China's success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.Copyright © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

0	Hemodialysis Vascular Access Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Dialysis patients are more vulnerable and susceptible to the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to multiple comorbidities. Since Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease worldwide, it is crucial to act in advance to prevent a potential disaster. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implement proactive infection control measures to prevent it from spreading without sacrificing the dialysis care quality. In this article, we focused on hemodialysis vascular access (HVA) care in particular. As a life-line of hemodialysis (HD) patients, HVA care has a profound impact on the patient's quality of dialysis and life. Specifically, in our facility, the working and office areas of the HD units are separated to reduce cross-infection. All elective procedures for HVA are postponed, and operating rooms equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom are used for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Herein, we share how we modified our HVA care policy not only to prevent our patients from COVID-19 infection but also to maintain the quality of HVA care.	false
0	"Quantifying the impact of physical distance measures on the transmission of COVID-19 in the UK. Background: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R 0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Method(s): We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a ""lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the ""lockdown"" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Result(s): We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R 0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. Conclusion(s): The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."	false
0	"The Current and Future State of Vaccines, Antivirals and Gene Therapies Against Emerging Coronaviruses. Emerging coronaviruses (CoV) are constant global public health threats to society. Multiple ongoing clinical trials for vaccines and antivirals against CoVs showcase the availability of medical interventions to both prevent and treat the future emergence of highly pathogenic CoVs in human. However, given the diverse nature of CoVs and our close interactions with wild, domestic and companion animals, the next epidemic zoonotic CoV could resist the existing vaccines and antivirals developed, which are primarily focused on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV). In late 2019, the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global public health concern. In this review, we will summarize the key advancements of current vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as discuss the challenge and opportunity in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis. At the end, we advocate the development of a ""plug-and-play"" platform technologies that could allow quick manufacturing and administration of broad-spectrum countermeasures in an outbreak setting. We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for in vivo therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs.© Copyright © 2020 Tse, Meganck, Graham and Baric."	false
0	"The novel immunomodulatory biologic LMWF5A for pharmacological attenuation of the ""cytokine storm"" in COVID-19 patients: A hypothesis. Background: A common complication of viral pulmonary infections, such as in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is a phenomenon described as a ""cytokine storm"". While poorly defined, this hyperinflammatory response results in diffuse alveolar damage. The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm. Presentation of the hypothesis: A variety of human in vitro immune models indicate that LMWF5A reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures. Testing the hypothesis: A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Implications of hypothesis: If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."	false
0	Feasibility of a Pilot Program for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Collection in Wuhan, China. BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus has caused an international outbreak. Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHOD(S): Patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than two weeks were recruited. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)-specific donor screening and selection were performed based the following criteria: 1) aged 18-55years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID-19; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 h apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2weeks; and 6) had no COVID-19 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5 Celsius, and 4weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors' plasma was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and S-RBD-specific IgG antibody. RESULT(S): Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first-time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 ml. All Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, anti-syphilis and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors' plasma units were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of >=1:320. CONCLUSION(S): Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of >=1:160 for S-RBD-specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.

0	COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women: Two weeks of confirmed presentations to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals. The novel coronavirus 2019, or COVID-19, infection has rapidly spread through the New York metropolitan area since the first reported case in the state on March 1, 2020. New York currently represents an epicenter for COVID-19 infection in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early experience with seven COVID-positive patients in pregnancy, including two women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 following an asymptomatic initial presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting to a pair of affiliated New York City hospitals over two weeks from March 13 to 27, 2020. Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22. Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation. There were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Applying COVID-19 disease severity characteristics as described by Wu et al, 37 (86%) women possessed mild disease, four (9.3%) exhibited severe disease, and two (4.7%) developed critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described for non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infections (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).

0	Epidemiology and clinical features of emergency department patients with suspected COVID-19: Initial results from the COVID-19 Emergency Department Quality Improvement Project (COVED-1). Objective: The COVID-19 Emergency Department (COVED) Quality Improvement Project aims to provide regular and real-time clinical information to ED clinicians caring for patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. The present study summarises data from the first 2 weeks of the study. Method(s): COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. Result(s): In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (n = 122 [67%]), cough (n = 108 [56%]) or fever (n = 98 [51%]). Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%) patients, respectively. Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients, respectively. Eleven (5%) patients received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the low incidence of positive cases currently precludes the development of predictive tools, the COVED Project demonstrates that the rapid establishment of an agile clinical registry for emergency care is feasible.Copyright © 2020 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine	false

0	Insights for increased risk of failed fibrinolytic therapy and stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. Important health resources are dedicated worldwide to the management of COVID-19. This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19. Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed. Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy. He finally died because of cardiogenic shock. This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI. This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors. In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	false
0	Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures. Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Method(s): We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Finding(s): Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589.5, 49.3, and 37.5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2.2 million. Interpretation(s): Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection: A case report from Uganda. There are no reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV co-infection from sub-Saharan Africa where 70% of people living with HIV are found. We report a case of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection from Uganda. A 34 year old HIV-positive female on antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz) for 5 years, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). She was asymptomatic at presentation but subsequently developed headache, chest pain, diarrhoea, anorexia and fatigue on day 3 of isolation without cough, fever or shortness of breath. Her CD4 count was 965 cells/mm3, the HIV viral load was undetectable (<1,000 cells/mm3) and other laboratory work up was normal. She was successfully managed with hydroxychloroquine and broad spectrum antibiotics, and was discharged after 24 days. This case demonstrates an atypical clinical presentation of COVID - 19 in an HIV infected patient without other co-morbidity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical And Analytical Performance Of An Automated Serological Test That Identifies S1/S2 Neutralizing IgG In COVID-19 Patients Semiquantitatively. BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, highly selective serological testing is essential to define exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULT(S): The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved to be highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The assay's diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or >=15 days from diagnosis, respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The assay's specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values. CONCLUSION(S): The automated LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests/hour. The semiquantitative results provided by the test also associate with the presence of neutralizing antibodies, and may provide a useful tool for the large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use.Copyright © 2020 Bonelli et al.	false
0	Circulating Exosomes from Human Lung Transplant Recipients Having Respiratory Viral Infections Contain Nucleic Acids and Activate Signaling Pathways CGAS/STING and RIG-1. Purpose: Exosomes are membrane bound vesicles are released by cells into body fluids. Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K-alpha Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Method(s): Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem's library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Result(s): Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFNbeta) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion(s): We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.Copyright © 2020	false

During these months in which the COVID-19 emergency is waning, the activity of dermatologists has changes substantially. Since the beginning of March 2020, in the Dermatology Clinic at the University Hospital in Turin (Italy) the outpatient access has been significantly reduced and telemedicine has been useful whenever possible, by putting the patient in contact directly with dermatologists or mediated by the general practitioners.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19 infection: in pursuit of the scientific evidence. BACKGROUND: Chest computed tomography (CT) may be used for the diagnosis of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but clear scientific evidence is lacking. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalences of chest CT findings were calculated using a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2>=50), otherwise a fixed effects model was used., RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. Median number of COVID-19 patients per study was 124 (range 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range >76.3%-100%). 27/28 (96%) of studies had a retrospective design. Methodological quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (8 studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT findings ranged between 10.5%-63.2%., CONCLUSION: Studies on chest CT findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodological quality concerns. More high-quality research is necessary to establish diagnostic CT criteria for COVID-19. Based on the available evidence that requires cautious interpretation, several chest CT findings appear to be suggestive of COVID-19, but normal chest CT findings do not exclude COVID-19, even not in symptomatic patients.

0	Neurosurgical Practice During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic: A Worldwide Survey. Background and Objective: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has consistently changed medical practice throughout specialties, regardless of their contribution in facing the disease itself. We surveyed neurosurgeons worldwide to investigate the situation they are experiencing. Method(s): A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020, by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into 3 subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data were initially elaborated using SurveyMonkey software. Country-specific data were extracted from the World Health Organization website. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.3. Result(s): Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for patients with SARS-CoV-2 (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest radiograph. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), whereas indications were modified for nonurgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). Conclusion(s): Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines. Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems. Sharing data and experiences will be of paramount importance to address the present moment and challenges in the near future.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false

0	Features of anosmia in COVID-19. Background: Medical publications about anosmia with COVID-19 are scarce. We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients with anosmia between March 1st and March 17th, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. Result(s): Fifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (+/- 16) years; 67% were females and 37% were hospitalised. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (+/- 1.6 [0-7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (+/- 1.9 [1-8]) days after infection onset. The mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (+/- 6.3 [1-21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 days. Conclusion(s): Anosmia was present in half of our European COVID-19 patients and was often associated with dysgeusia.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS	false

0	Characteristics of Women of Reproductive Age with Laboratory-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Pregnancy Status - United States, January 22-June 7, 2020. As of June 16, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 2,104,346 cases and 116,140 deaths in the United States.* During pregnancy, women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that could increase their risk for more severe illness from respiratory infections (1,2). To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19-related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15-44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.	false
0	ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination prevents SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 20191,2 and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic3. Vaccines are an essential countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here, we show that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was not Th2 dominated, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. A single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced a humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated rhesus macaques. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is currently under investigation in a phase I clinical trial. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials.	false
0	[Cardiovascular disease in times of COVID-19]. There are increasing reports of a drastic drop in consultations and cardiovascular procedures (including urgencies and emergencies) in regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a consequent marked increase in total mortality that is not fully explained by COVID-19. Cardiovascular disease leads the ranking in deaths in adults in Argentina with 280 deaths per day, and in recent decades we have reduced its mortality by 20-30% through various evidence-based interventions. Herein we conducted predictive analyses to understand what could be the consequences of a worse implementation of those interventions. We estimate that less control of cardiovascular risk factors from April to October 2020 could cause up to 10 500 new preventable cases of cardiovascular disease. In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%. A marginal 10% to 15% increase in relative risk of cardiovascular death would be equivalent to an excess of 6000 to 9000 preventable deaths. In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina. It is necessary to inform the authorities and educate the public so cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors remain a health priority, as long as resources exist and minimizing the risk of contagion and spread of the virus.	false
0	[Cardiac biomarkers and COVID-19 - Phenotypes and Interpretation]. Current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 inducing viral COVID-19 pneumonia, is categorized in 3 stages. Some biomarkers could be assigned to one of these stages, showing a correlation to mortality in COVID-19 patients. Laboratory findings in COVID-19, especially when serially evaluated, may represent individual disease severity and prognosis. These may help planning and controlling therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers for myocardial injury (high sensitive cardiac troponin, hsTn) or hemodynamic stress (NTproBNP) may occur in COVID-19 pneumonia such as in other pneumonias, correlating with severity and prognosis of the underlying disease. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients' mild increases of hsTn or NTproBNP may be explained by cardiovascular comorbidities and direct or indirect cardiac damage or stress caused by or during COVID-19 pneumonia. In case of suspected NSTE-ACS and COVID-19, indications for echocardiography or reperfusion strategy should be carefully considered against the risk of contamination.

0	Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with covid-19?. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARgamma agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Calling for an exponential escalation scheme in vaccine development for COVID-19. Purpose: COVID-19 as a pandemic calls for rapid development of vaccines. Method(s): Here a proposal of a seamless, adaptive, phase 1-3 trial for accelerated vaccine development is described. Result(s): Starting at 10, the number of vaccinated volunteers would exponentially increase by tenfold at an interval of 2 weeks; close surveillance of antibody responses, safety and efficacy is necessary. After only 16 weeks, general vaccination would be feasible if supply meets the demand. Conclusion(s): A COVID-19 vaccine would be rapidly available at a slightly increased risk for undetected late side effects or insufficient efficacy if compared with standard vaccine development schemes.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Call to Action: SARS-CoV-2 and CerebrovAscular DisordErs (CASCADE). Background and purpose: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), now named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may change the risk of stroke through an enhanced systemic inflammatory response, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial damage in the cerebrovascular system. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. Conclusion(s): The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis. It will also guide public health guidelines for at-risk populations to reduce risks of complications from such comorbidities.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Broad and strong memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 in UK convalescent COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 is an ongoing global crisis in which the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics will depend critically on understanding the natural immunity to the virus, including the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. We have conducted a study of 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell responses to those of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell responses using IFNgamma based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart from ORF1. We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, and this effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a proteins. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4 + and/or CD8 + epitopes, which strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors, including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8 + T cells than spike-specific CD8 + T cells were observed. They furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + to CD4 + T cell responses. Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated with milder disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.	false

0	Biomarker variation in patients successfully treated with tocilizumab for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): results of a multidisciplinary collaboration. OBJECTIVES: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to SARS-CoV-2 is likely due to a cytokine storm characterised by a major release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Blocking excessive IL-6 production might be the key to the COVID-19-ARDS treatment. Beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade using a humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ) were previously reported in patients with COVID-19 related ARDS. The aim of the study was to study the variation over time of several biomarkers, demonstrated to be predictors of poor prognostic, in subjects successfully treated with TCZ for severe COVID-19. METHOD(S): Retrospective analysis of a case series of patients with COVID-19-ARDS, evidenced by RT-PCR and lung CT-scan. Patients with increasing O2 requirements, within the window of opportunity for TCZ treatment (Day 7 to Day 17 after onset of symptoms) were treated with TCZ (2 infusions of 8 mg/kg). Demographic, biological and clinical data were collected from the patients' files. Serum levels of CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, lymphocytes, platelets, creatinine, D-dimer and liver enzymes were assayed at the time of the first TCZ administration, then every two days for 8 days. RESULT(S): 40 patients were treated with TCZ. Most of them had several comorbidities, and all had multiple biological abnormalities (lymphopenia, increased CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver enzymes). 30 patients (75%) benefited from TCZ and 10 patients died. In the survivors, following TCZ administration CRP decreased dramatically as early as day 4 (-86.7%, p<0.0001) and returned to normal at day 6. Fibrinogen and lymphocyte count returned to normal values at day 6. Ferritin also decreased significantly. No significant change was observed for D-dimer (p=0.68) and other studied biomarkers (haemoglobin, leucocyte count, AST). CONCLUSION(S): In patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, treatment with TCZ resulted in favourable evolution in 75% of the cases. Biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen) decreased dramatically as early as the 4th day after TCZ injection. Lymphopenia, a predictor of poor prognostic, was reversed 6 days after TCZ injection.	false

0	B-cell depleting therapies may affect susceptibility to acute respiratory illness among patients with multiple sclerosis during the early COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Objective: To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease. Method(s): In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system. Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. Result(s): Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care. In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005). Conclusion(s): The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery. B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Attenuated SARS-CoV-2 variants with deletions at the S1/S2 junction. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.	false

0	Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients Can Contaminate Their Surroundings: an Environment Sampling Study. The contamination of patients' surroundings by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains understudied. We sampled the surroundings and the air of six negative-pressure non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) rooms in a designated isolation ward in Chengdu, China, that were occupied by 13 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who had returned from overseas travel, including 2 asymptomatic patients. A total of 44 of 112 (39.3%) surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as detected by real-time PCR, suggesting extensive contamination, although all of the air samples were negative. In particular, in a single room occupied by an asymptomatic patient, four sites were SARS-CoV-2 positive, highlighting that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients do contaminate their surroundings and impose risks for others with close contact. Placement of COVID-19 patients in rooms with negative pressure may bring a false feeling of safety, and the importance of rigorous environment cleaning should be emphasized.IMPORTANCE Although it has been well recognized that the virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, can be acquired by exposure to fomites, surprisingly, the contamination of patients' surroundings by SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown, as there have been few studies. We performed an environmental sampling study for 13 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and found extensive contamination of patients' surroundings. In particular, we found that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients contaminated their surroundings and therefore imposed risks for other people. Environment cleaning should be emphasized in negative-pressure rooms. The findings may be useful to guide infection control practice to protect health care workers.Copyright © 2020 Wei et al.	false

0	Assessment of Specimen Pooling to Conserve SARS CoV-2 Testing Resources. Objectives To establish the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Methods The most efficient pool size was determined to be 5 specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 microliter from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 microliter each) for a total volume of 250 microliter l. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12-pools. Results All 25 pools were positive with Cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that two pools were positive followed by identification of two individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions. Conclusions When the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.	false

The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit health-care systems and societies in an unprecedented manner. In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being ""with"" rather than ""by"" SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither sig-nificant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, anti-inflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. (AIDS Rev. (ahead of print)).Copyright © 2020, Publicaciones Permanyer. All rights reserved."	false

0	Etiology and genetic evolution of canine coronavirus circulating in five provinces of China, during 2018-2019. As the outbreaks of COVID-19 in worldwide, coronavirus has once again caught the attention of people. Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV-I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions. In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with connective tissue diseases: a descriptive observational analysis. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 in China has very quickly become a global health emergency with almost two million of infected patients worldwide.[1] Along with the spread of the pandemic, there has been a growing concern about the management of fragile rheumatic patients, for whom there is still very little data available. In particular, subjects affected by connective tissue diseases (CTD) are known to have an increased infectious risk compared to the healthy population due to a general impairment of the immune system intrinsic to the autoimmune disease itself, the iatrogenic effect linked to the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and the high number of comorbidities that often complicate the clinical picture.[2,3].	false
0	Assessment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Community Containment Strategies in Shenzhen, China. Importance: A new outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Wuhan, China, is spreading rapidly around the globe. Limited information on control in community settings is available. Objective(s): To detail measures enacted within a community to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate the spread of COVID-19 associated with implementation of the program. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This case series study details the implementation of prevention measures in a specific community setting among community-dwelling individuals exposed to or at risk of COVID-19 in Haiyu, Shenzhen, China, from January 23 to April 10, 2020. Exposures: Community containment strategies for tracking, quarantine, and management were strictly, cooperatively, and effectively implemented by a team that included a general practitioner, a community manager, and public safety bureau officials. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of locally acquired cases with indirect links to confirmed COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis with COVID-19 was confirmed when throat swab samples tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Approximately 34686 individuals live in Haiyu, including 2382 residents aged 65 years or older. Seven individuals with COVID-19 acquired outside the community (age, 20-70 years; 3 [42%] women) were moved from quarantine to a hospital for standard isolation treatment. A total of 20 people who were asymptomatic and who had had direct contact with these individuals were closely observed by health care workers at a nearby hotel. Additionally, 800 individuals considered to be at higher risk were moved from quarantine to home isolation for 14 days. There were no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 with indirect links reported in the Haiyu community from the time that the study began on January 23, 2020, to April 10, 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that cooperation among the authorities of multiple sectors allowed for the implementation of preventive measures that were associated with limited community transmission.	false
0	Application of a portable instrument for rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any environment. The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is creating serious challenges for health laboratories that seek to identify viral infections as early as possible, optimally at the earliest appearance of symptom. Indeed, there is urgent need to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodologies not only to use in health laboratory environments but also directly in places where humans circulate and spread the virus such as airports, trains, boats, and any public aggregation places. The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner. The objective of this article is to describe an innovative multidisciplinary approach to develop an efficient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use portable instrument (bCUBE by Hyris Ltd) that can be employed as a surveillance system for the emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. A solution for Coronavirus testing, compliant with CDC guidelines, is scheduled to be released in the next weeks. In addition, we will describe a workflow and path of an integrated multi-omic approach that will lead to host and pathogen biomarker discovery in order to train the instrument to provide reliable results based on a specific biomarker's fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

0	Analysis of adenovirus infection in acute respiratory tract infection cases in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Objective To study the epidemiological characteristics and mixed infection of adenovirus in acute respiratory tract infections in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019, and to provide scientific basis for the prevention and control of adenovirus. Methods Acute respiratory tract infections were collected from 3 hospitals in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Relevant information was registered and respiratory specimens were sampled for detection of respiratory pathogens by multiplex PCR. Results A total of 1 543 cases of acute respiratory tract infection were included. The positive rate of adenovirus was 2.92%(45/1 543), the positive rates of influenza like illness (ILl) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were 2.74%(29/1 058) and 3.30%(16/485), respectively. The positive rate of ILl during January-May 2019 was 5.43%(7/129), higher than that in the same period of 2015- 2018 (0.52%-4.48%) (Fisher' s exact test value8.92, P0.036). The incidence of adenoviruspositive cases was mainly distributed in the first and second quarters, accounting for 62.22% (28/45). The difference of the incidence of adenovirus-positive cases in each quarter was significant (x 41 5flJj Chin J Epidemiol,May 2020,Vol.41 ,No.5 12.52, P0.006). The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1 .89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups (x216.94, P0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age (x210.16, P0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48% - 4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic (,2 - 11.53, P- 0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILl and SARI were 34.48% (10/ 29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus. Conclusion Adenovirus surveillance should be further strengthened in adolescents with a focus on students and other key groups in the second quarter.Copyright © 2020 Chinese Medical Association.

0	Aligning Student-Led Initiatives and Incident Command System Resources in a Pandemic. Removed from classrooms and clinics amid the COVID-19 pandemic, health professions students have answered the call to serve alternate roles by rapidly mobilizing to address health system and community-identified needs in innovative ways. Many institutions, including the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), have formally recognized student roles by adding service learning requirements to adapted curricula. Although the crisis has spurred an explosion of student-led volunteer initiatives, many risk operating beyond the protection of their academic institution and could bolster their efficacy by harnessing institutional resources.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	"Transmission and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in 104 outside-Wuhan patients, China. Objective: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Method(s): Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 23, 2020. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Demographic, clinical and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Result(s): Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases who were immigrated from Wuhan; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 ""generations"" was observed. Five asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years and 49 (47.12%) were male. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days, 96 (92.31%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. Average hospital stay was 10 (rang, 8-14) days. Conclusion(s): Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers, suggesting the timely control measures after the Wuhan shutdown wok well. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. A 14-day quarantine may need to be prolonged. This article is protected by copyright.

0	A Trial of CONvalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Adults With Acute COVID-19 Respiratory Illness. Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS‐CoV‐2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID‐19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID‐19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections. Passive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID‐19 convalescent plasma for use is patients with severe or life‐threatening infections [2]. Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody‐dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non‐neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re‐infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID‐19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load. Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID‐19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS‐CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell‐mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells. Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID‐19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID‐19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID‐19 will be established. Donor recruitment: Recovered COVID‐19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with public health services, local health authorities, and individual co‐investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self‐identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will be directed to a New York Blood Center site in their area to donate. Criteria for donors: All donors between the ages of 18 and 70 will need to meet donor selection criteria set forth by the FDA and NYBC. In addition, donors will require: Prior diagnosis of COVID‐19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 serology following infection At least 14 days since resolution of COVID‐19 symptoms Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti‐HLA antibodies At least 6 days since last plasma donation Provided informed consent Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer‐generated, web‐accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained. Duration of follow‐up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3 days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted at Day 90+/‐ 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site. Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow‐up. We estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary endpoints will be available after 90‐day from last patient enrollment. Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2‐tailed test at level α = 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization. Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien‐Fleming stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well‐being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference. Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention‐to‐treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID‐19 donor).	false
0	A three-generation family cluster with COVID-19 infection: should quarantine be prolonged?. Objectives: Families are a transmission route for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of the close contact. Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. Study design: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. Method(s): The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. Result(s): In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. Conclusion(s): Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health	false
0	Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries. Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals andintensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.Copyright © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

0	Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. Objective: To understand the incidence trend and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. Method(s): The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Result(s): A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusion(s): At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated. However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges.	false

0	A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Developing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 could be guided by the distribution of epitopes, not only on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein, but also across the full Spike (S) protein. We isolated and characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten convalescent COVID-19 patients. Three mAbs showed neutralizing activities against authentic SARS-CoV-2. An mAb, named 4A8, exhibits high neutralization potency against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, but does not bind the RBD. We defined the epitope of 4A8 as the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein by determining its cryo-EM structure in complex with the S protein to an overall resolution of 3.1 Angstrom and local resolution of 3.3 Angstrom for the 4A8-NTD interface. This points to the NTD as a promising target for therapeutic mAbs against COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

0	A cluster of health care workers with COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei, China, spreads across national and international borders. Method(s): We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China. Result(s): Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases. Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients. There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years). The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%). On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia. Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significantly elevated in 86% of them. The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs. The most frequent findings on pulmonary computed tomographic images were bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacifications (86%). Conclusion(s): Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has occurred among HCWs, and most of these infected HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 are mild cases. Our data suggest that in the epidemic area of COVID-19, stringent and urgent surveillance and infection-control measures should be implemented to protect doctors and nurses from COVID-19 infection.Copyright © 2020	false
0	A clinical, histopathological and laboratory study of 19 consecutive Italian paediatric patients with chilblain-like lesions: lights and shadows on the relationship with COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: Acral chilblain-like lesions are being increasingly reported during COVID-19 pandemic. However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID-19 infection has not been clarified yet. OBJECTIVE(S): To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain-like lesions, and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD(S): Following informed consent, patients underwent: (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT-PCR and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger- and toe-nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence, and, in selected cases, electron microscopy. RESULT(S): Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11/19 (58%) of them and/or their cohabitants reported flu-like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillarcosopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included: epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in 2 cases. Blood exams were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3. CONCLUSION(S): Chilblain-like lesions during COVID-19 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID-19. Further investigations on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and pathogenesis of chilblain-like lesions are warranted.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Transmission Potential of Asymptomatic and Paucisymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infections: A 3-Family Cluster Study in China. Data concerning the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients are lacking. We report a 3-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight of 15 (53%) members from 3 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of 8 patients, 3 were asymptomatic and 1 was paucisymptomatic. An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his 3-month-old daughter. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of 1 household. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were >99.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is mainly produced by damaged or regenerating alveolar type II pneumocytes. This preliminary study analyzed serum concentrations of KL-6 in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to verify its potential as a prognostic biomarker of severity. Twenty-two patients (median age [interquartile range] 63 [59-68] years, 16 males) with COVID-19 were enrolled prospectively. Patients were divided into mild-moderate and severe groups, according to respiratory impairment and clinical management. KL-6 serum concentrations and lymphocyte subset were obtained. Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells/micro L were significantly higher in nonsevere patients than in the severe group (P =.0449) and the best cut-off value was 119 cells/micro L. KL-6 serum concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients than the nonsevere group (P =.0118). Receiver operating characteristic analysis distinguished severe and nonsevere patients according to KL-6 serum levels and the best cut-off value was 406.5 U/mL. NK cell analysis and assay of KL-6 in serum can help identify severe COVID-19 patients. Increased KL-6 serum concentrations were observed in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, revealing a prognostic value and supporting the potential usefulness of KL-6 measurement to evaluate COVID-19 patients' prognosis.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Four point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays for diagnosis of COVID-19 and for assessing dynamics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the role of rapid serological tests in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHOD(S): This retrospective study enrolled 16 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and 58 COVID-19 negative patients at a medical center in Taiwan over a 3-month period. Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests. RESULT(S): The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia. CONCLUSION(S): Though the POC antibody rapid tests based on LFIA showed reliable performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, the results of these tests should be interpreted and applied appropriately in the context of antibody dynamic of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response than COVID-19 patients without pneumonia.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	false
0	TB infection and BCG vaccination: are we protected from COVID-19?. Objectives: The incidence of emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease is variable across the different parts of the world. Apart from travel patterns, other factors determining this difference may include host immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tuberculosis (TB) endemicity and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) coverage on COVID-19. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Method(s): We reviewed available data regarding TB incidence, BCG coverage (as per the World Health Organization), and COVID-19 incidence of 174 countries. We divided the countries into four cohorts depending on annual TB incidence and BCG coverage. Result(s): Countries with high TB incidence had lower COVID-19 than countries with low TB incidence. Similarly, countries with high BCG coverage had lower incidence of COVID-19, suggesting some protective mechanisms in TB-endemic areas. However, the ecological differences and different testing strategies between countries could not be accounted for in this analysis. Conclusion(s): Higher TB incidence and BCG coverage were found to be associated with lesser incidence of COVID-19. This outcome paves the way for further research into pathogenesis and immune response in COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health	false

0	Guidance for otolaryngology health care workers performing aerosol generating medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a predilection for infecting the mucosa of the upper and lower airways. Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. Recommendations: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination. Conclusion(s): By following strict infection prevention recommendations, the risk of HCWs becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients can be minimized. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly, these recommendations should serve as guidance and need to be interpreted based on local factors and availability of healthcare resources.

0	Structure-guided mutagenesis alters deubiquitinating activity and attenuates pathogenesis of a murine coronavirus. Coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain-like protease, termed papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein and as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2/DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly to the wild-type (WT) virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to that of the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) in viral titer in liver and spleen at day 5 postinfection (d p.i.), although both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of the PLP2-ubiquitin complex and that PLP2/DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

0	Clinical Manifestation and Laboratory Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pregnant Women. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has become a major challenge to public health in China and other countries, considering its pathogenicity across all age groups. Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition, and is characterized by altered immunity and elevated hormone levels to actively tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, which undergoes a sudden and substantial fluctuation during the immediate postpartum period. Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and post-partum periods require further elucidation. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods. Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum. Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.Copyright © 2020, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS.	false
0	Continuous Intravenous Anakinra Infusion to Calm the Cytokine Storm in Macrophage Activation Syndrome. Objective: The objective of this study was to report the benefit of a therapeutic approach consisting of intravenous (IV) continuous anakinra (recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) infusions in treating severely ill adult patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Method(s): A retrospective chart review of five patients treated at Regions Hospital from 2016 to 2019 was conducted. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and outcomes were recorded. Result(s): Continuous IV anakinra infusions up to 2400 mg/d resulted in rapid serologic, then clinical response in 4 of 5 severely ill patients who were refractory to all other therapies, including subcutaneous anakinra. Subsequently, 3 of 5 patients have been maintained on anakinra or canakinumab, with no recurrence of MAS. Conclusion(s): Continuous infusion of IV anakinra may result in rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with MAS. This method for treating cytokine storm should be considered in the current COVID-19 pandemic in the subgroup of patients with severe disease who have a cytokine storm presentation.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

0	Convalescent Plasma Compared to Anti-COVID-19 Human Immunoglobulin and Standard Treatment (TE) in Hospitalized Patients. The study population will be patients (≥18 years) hospitalized by COVID‐19 but still with an early form of the disease (in states 1‐3 of the ordinal scale) who do not require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non‐invasive) and who can give their consent informed. All the participants will receive non‐specific supportive treatment for COVID‐19 such as oxygen, IV liquid or corticosteroids. Additionally, they will be randomized to one of the following arms: Experimental arm 1: Plasma with inactivation/reduction of pathogens from convalescent patients with COVID‐19 and who at the same time receive support therapy, in the 200 ‐ 250 mL scheme, on days 1 and 3 of the intervention. Experimental arm: Anti‐COVID‐19 human immunoglobulin produced by Lifefactors Zona Franca S.A.S, intravenous at a dose of immunoglobulin 10% IgG solution (10% mL vial) for: Patient of 50 Kg or more, a dose of 50 mL will be applied on days 1 and 3 of treatment. Patients of less than 50 Kg, the dose will be 1 mL / Kg, will be applied on days 1 and 3 of treatment. This arm will be included once available. The supply of anti‐COVID‐19 human immunoglobulin produced by LifeFactors will be carried out once the national regulatory agency (Invima) grants authorization and/or the regulatory requirements for the production of medications are met. Control arm: Standard (specific) therapy for COVID‐19 according to the suggested pharmacological recommendations of the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases ‐ ACIN. This therapy is subject to changes that are determined by the Colombian Health Regulatory Authorities.	false
0	Practical guidance for the management of adults with immune thrombocytopenia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is to support clinicians and, although recommendations have been provided, it is not a formal guideline. Nor is there sufficient evidence base to conclude that alternative approaches to treatment are incorrect. Instead, it is a consensus written by clinicians with an interest in ITP or coagulation disorders and reviewed by members of the UK ITP forum.Copyright © 2020 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd	false

A maternal woman was positive for SARS-CoV-2 tested in throat swabs but negative tested in other body fluids, and she had IgG and IgA detected in breast milk. Her infant negative for SARS-CoV-2 at birth had elevated IgG in serum but quickly decayed. These findings suggest that breastfeeding might have the potential benefit to the neonates.	false
0	An outbreak of severe Kawasaki-like disease at the Italian epicentre of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: an observational cohort study. Background: The Bergamo province, which is extensively affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, is a natural observatory of virus manifestations in the general population. In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Method(s): All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Finding(s): Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3.0 years [SD 2.5]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7.5 years [SD 3.5]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both. The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 vs group 2, 0.3 vs ten per month), mean age (3.0 vs 7.5 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 vs six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 vs eight of ten; all p<0.01). Interpretation(s): In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Funding(s): None.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	An Aberration Detection-Based Approach for Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance of COVID-19 and Other Novel Influenza-Like Illnesses. Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.	false
0	Advances on Antiviral Activity of Morus spp. Plant Extracts: Human Coronavirus and Virus-Related Respiratory Tract Infections in the Spotlight. (1) Background: Viral respiratory infections cause life-threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year. Human coronavirus and several picornaviruses are responsible for worldwide epidemic outbreaks, thus representing a heavy burden to their hosts. In the absence of specific treatments for human viral infections, natural products offer an alternative in terms of innovative drug therapies. (2) Methods: We analyzed the antiviral properties of the leaves and stem bark of the mulberry tree (Morus spp.). We compared the antiviral activity of Morus spp. on enveloped and nonenveloped viral pathogens, such as human coronavirus (HCoV 229E) and different members of the Picornaviridae family-human poliovirus 1, human parechovirus 1 and 3, and human echovirus 11. The antiviral activity of 12 water and water-alcohol plant extracts of the leaves and stem bark of three different species of mulberry-Morus alba var. alba, Morus alba var. rosa, and Morus rubra-were evaluated. We also evaluated the antiviral activities of kuwanon G against HCoV-229E. (3) Results: Our results showed that several extracts reduced the viral titer and cytopathogenic effects (CPE). Leaves' water-alcohol extracts exhibited maximum antiviral activity on human coronavirus, while stem bark and leaves' water and water-alcohol extracts were the most effective on picornaviruses. (4) Conclusion(s): The analysis of the antiviral activities of Morus spp. offer promising applications in antiviral strategies.	false
0	Advances in the relationship between coronavirus infection and cardiovascular diseases. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has once again aroused people's concern about coronavirus. Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been discovered so far, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU115, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. At the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis. In this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. This review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)	false
0	Adults at high-risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) in Brazil. OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (>= 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age >= 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.	false
0	Diabetes and COVID-19. According to previous reports, diabetes seems to be a risk factor which worsens the serious clinical events caused by COVID-19. But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugs - including those targeting DPP4-related pathways - produce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients. This paper provides related French and international recommendations for people with diabetes who got infected by COVID-19 and upholds that infections may alter glucose control and may require additional vigilance.Copyright © 2020 Societe francaise de pharmacologie et de therapeutique.

0	Testing for SARS-CoV-2: the day the world turned its attention to the clinical laboratory. In the last few months, an unprecedented number of laboratory tests for COVID-19 have been developed at a remarkable speed. With the rapid adoption of these tests into clinical practice, combined with the widespread publicity they received, questions arose related to the different types of tests, their utility, performance, and regulatory approval status. The aim of this publication is to provide a general landscape of laboratory testing for COVID-19 and offer a historical and regulatory perspective associated with them. Specifically, we aim to elaborate on the regulatory complexities of diagnostic testing in the U.S. and its implications to the present outbreak, as well as provide a synopsis of laboratory tests that have been developed for COVID-19. We will first address the detection of Sars-Cov-2 directly by either nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or by the detection of the viral protein for active infections. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of serological tests that can aid not only in diagnosis but additionally help to identify prior infections and potential immunity.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	CT features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia according to clinical presentation: a retrospective analysis of 120 consecutive patients from Wuhan city. Objectives: To characterize the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to clinical severity. We compared the CT features of common cases and severe cases, symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients, and febrile and afebrile patients. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical and thoracic CT features of 120 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to a tertiary university hospital between January 10 and February 10, 2020, in Wuhan city, China. Result(s): On admission, the patients generally complained of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue, with diarrhea often present in severe cases. Severe patients were 20 years older on average and had comorbidities and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. There were no differences in the CT findings between asymptomatic and symptomatic common type patients or between afebrile and febrile patients, defined according to Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. Conclusion(s): The clinical and CT features at admission may enable clinicians to promptly evaluate the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware that clinically silent cases may present with CT features similar to those of symptomatic common patients. Key Points: * The clinical features and predominant patterns of abnormalities on CT for asymptomatic, typic common, and severe cases were summarized. These findings may help clinicians to identify severe patients quickly at admission. * Clinicians should be cautious that CT findings of afebrile/asymptomatic patients are not better than the findings of other types of patients. These patients should also be quarantined. * The use of chest CT as the main screening method in epidemic areas is recommended.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.	false
0	COVID-19: impact on colorectal surgery. Aim: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the medical and surgical healthcare systems. With the ongoing need for urgent and emergency colorectal surgery, including surgery for colorectal cancer, several questions pertaining to operating room (OR) utilization and techniques needed to be rapidly addressed. Method(s): This manuscript discusses knowledge related to the critical considerations of patient and caregiver safety relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the operating room environment. Result(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required contingent upon local availability of COVID-19 testing and the incidence of known COVID-19 infection in the respective community. In addition to standard COVID-19 PPE precautions, a negative-pressure environment, including an OR, has been recommended, especially for the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Hospital spaces ranging from patient wards to ORs to endoscopy rooms have been successfully converted from standard positive-pressure to negative-pressure spaces. Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered. Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles. Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management. Conclusion(s): This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world. Although there is no single universally agreed upon set of answers, we have presented what we think is a balanced cogent description of logical safe approaches to colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright Colorectal Disease © 2020 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland	false
0	Evaluation of two commercial and two non-commercial immunoassays for the detection of prior infection to SARS-CoV-2. Background Seroepidemiology is an important tool to characterize the epidemiology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 but many immunoassays have not been externally validated raising questions about reliability of study findings. To ensure meaningful data, particularly in a low seroprevalence population, assays need to be rigorously characterized with high specificity. Methods We evaluated two commercial (Roche Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgM/IgG) and two non-commercial (Simoa and Ragon/MGH IgG) immunoassays against 68 confirmed positive and 232 pre-pandemic negative controls. Sensitivity was stratified by time from symptom onset. The Simoa multiplex assay applied three pre-defined algorithm models to determine sample result. Results The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays each registered 1/232 false positive, the primary Simoa model registered 2/232 false positives, and the Epitope registered 2/230 and 3/230 false positives for the IgG and IgM assays respectively. Sensitivity >21 days post symptom-onset was 100% for all assays except Epitope IgM, but lower and/or with greater variability between assays for samples collected 9-14 days (67-100%) and 15-21 days (69-100%) post-symptom onset. The Simoa and Epitope IgG assays demonstrated excellent sensitivity earlier in the disease course. The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays were less sensitive during early disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals. Conclusions The Epitope IgG demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. The Roche and Ragon/MGH IgG assays registered rare false positives with lower early sensitivity. The Simoa assay primary model had excellent sensitivity and few false positives.	false
0	The autoimmune response elicited by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) infection is modulated by liver tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). In a previous work we demonstrated that inhibition of mouse indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by methyltryptophan (MT) exacerbated the pathological actions of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) infection, suggesting that tryptophan (TRP) catabolism was involved in viral effects. Since there is a second enzyme that dioxygenates TRP, tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO), which is mainly located in liver, we decided to study its role in our model of MHV-infection. Results showed that in vivo TDO inhibition by LM10, a derivative of 3-(2-(pyridyl) ethenyl) indole, resulted in a decrease of anti- MHV Ab titers induced by the virus infection. Besides, a reduction of some alarmin release, i.e, uric acid and high-mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1), was observed. Accordingly, since alarmin liberation was related to the expression of autoantibodies (autoAb) to fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), these autoAb also diminished. Moreover, PCR results indicated that TDO inhibition did not abolish viral replication. Furthermore, histological liver examination did not reveal strong pathologies, whereas mouse survival was hundred percent in control as well as in MHV-infected mice treated with LM10. Data presented in this work indicate that in spite of the various TDO actions already described, specific TDO blockage could also restrain some MHV actions, mainly suppressing autoimmune reactions. Such results should prompt further experiments with various viruses to confirm the possible use of a TDO inhibitor such as LM-10 to treat either viral infections or even autoimmune diseases triggered by a viral infection.Copyright © 2019 European Federation of Immunological Societies	false

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000 cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate.1-3 Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies.4 Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.	false
0	The impact of biosensing in a pandemic outbreak: COVID-19. COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century. In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Itch in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: an unfolding scenario. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, that broke out in December 2019. In just four months it has spread to almost every country in the world and up to April 182 020, the virus has infected more than 2 million people. Itch is the most common symptom in dermatology and a frequent one of systemic diseases. The association of itch and viral diseases has been widely documented; however, the actual prevalence of itch in the patients suffering from new the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. In this paper, we present a review of the available literature on the topic of itch in the affected population. Moreover, we have also analysed different aspects of itch associated with COVID-19 pandemic, not directly related to the viral infection. Those included use of chemicals, hand sanitizers, common use of personal protective equipment and psychosocial stress. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.	false
0	Oropharyngeal Dysphagia and Aspiration Pneumonia Following Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report. Cranial nerve involvement is a finding often observed in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To our knowledge, this is the first report of oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with COVID-19. A 70-year-old male developed dysphagia and consequent aspiration pneumonia during recovery from severe COVID-19. He had altered sense of taste and absent gag reflex. Videoendoscopy, videofluorography, and high-resolution manometry revealed impaired pharyngolaryngeal sensation, silent aspiration, and mesopharyngeal contractile dysfunction. These findings suggested that glossopharyngeal and vagal neuropathy might have elicited dysphagia following COVID-19. The current case emphasizes the importance of presuming neurologic involvement and concurrent dysphagia, and that subsequent aspiration pneumonia might be overlooked in severe respiratory infection during COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).	false
0	Incorporating issues of Elderly Loneliness into the COVID-19 Public Health Response. As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the COVID-19 outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations. Loneliness is already a chief public health concern that is being made worse by COVID-19. Agencies should recognize the prevalence of loneliness amongst elderly populations and the impacts that their interventions have on loneliness. This letter describes several ways that loneliness can be addressed to build resilience for elderly populations as part of public health response to COVID-19.	false
0	Can cell therapies halt cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients?. A pilot study of COVID-19 patients treated with mesenchymal stem cells demonstrates safety. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapies, which have been explored for decades as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, are now being called into action to combat the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 may be due in part to the patient's response to the infection. In some patients, the virus induces an outpouring of inflammatory mediators that leads to swelling, inflammatory infiltration, and reduced gas exchange in the alveoli of the lungs. To combat this cytokine storm, over 20 clinical trials aiming to treat COVID-19 with MSCs have been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Leng et al. recently conducted a pilot study of MSC transplantation in 10 patients in China. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction and had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and oxygen saturation at rest <95%. Seven of the patients received intravenous infusions of allogeneic MSCs while three received saline as a placebo control. All seven MSC treated patients experienced resolution of symptoms while one of the placebo-treated patients went on to develop ARDS and another died. The response of the most severely ill patient treated with MSCs was monitored throughout recovery. Of note, C-reactive protein levels dropped 10-fold after MSC treatment, suggesting a drop in systemic inflammation. Analysis of cytokine levels before and after treatment revealed that MSC treatment, but not placebo, was associated with a halt in the increase of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and an increase in anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 concentrations in the serum. Although this study is not designed to make definitive claims regarding the efficacy of MSC therapy for COVID-19 or the mechanisms by which MSCs may function to prevent or treat cytokine storm, it does provide important safety data and hints of efficacy that have motivated further exploration of MSCs as a treatment for COVID-19. Of particular note is a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 trial enrolling 240 patients being conducted through a public-private partnership between the U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network and Mesoblast. As multiple clinical trials are launched around the world, we should not have to wait long to determine if MSCs are a viable and effective treatment option for severe COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, American Association for the Advancement of Science	false
0	The Coronavirus Pandemic: What Does the Evidence Show?. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world. The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks. This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19. Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.	false
0	Emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutation hot spots include a novel RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase variant. Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Method(s): We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann-Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. Result(s): We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2-5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0-3] (p value < 0.001). Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false

0	Does SARS-CoV-2 Trigger Stress-InducedAutoimmunity by Molecular Mimicry? A Hypothesis. Viruses can generate molecular mimicry phenomena within their hosts. Why shouldsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not be considered one of these?Information in this short review suggests that it might be so and, thus, encourages research aimingat testing this possibility. We propose, as a working hypothesis, that the virus induces antibodiesand that some of them crossreact with host's antigens, thus eliciting autoimmune phenomena withdevasting consequences in various tissues and organs. If confirmed, by in vitro and in vivo tests,this could drive researchers to find effective treatments against the virus.	false
0	Olfactory and Gustatory Outcomes in COVID-19: A Prospective Evaluation in Nonhospitalized Subjects. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the rate and timing of recovery of olfactory (OD) and gustatory (GD) dysfunction in patients affected by COVID-19., STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: Population-based evaluation in a COVID-19 high-prevalence region., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical course of OD and GD in a cohort of home-quarantined SARS-CoV-2-positive patients from Northern Italy. Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire at recruitment (T0). During follow-up, patients responded to online dedicated surveys modulated according to symptoms at T0., RESULTS: A total of 151 patients completed the follow-up survey. OD and/or GD were observed in 83% and 89% of subjects, respectively. Resolution rates of OD and GD at 30 days from onset were 87% and 82%, respectively. Risk factors for late resolution were grade of dysfunction at onset (total vs partial), gender, and presence of nasal congestion. Three (2%) patients previously reporting complete resolution of symptoms complained of subsequent recurrence of OD and/or GD after a mean of 19 days from resolution of the previous episode., CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related OD and GD had high rate of resolution in the first month from onset of symptoms. However, in 10% to 15% of patients, these symptoms showed only partial improvement after this period.	false
0	COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India. COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	false
0	Cellular pathology in the COVID-19 era: a European perspective on maintaining quality and safety. COVID-19 is a zoonotic viral infection that originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. WHO classified the resulting pandemic as a 'global health emergency' due to its virulence and propensity to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on diagnostic laboratories, particularly those handling cell and tissue specimens. This development carries serious implications for laboratory practice in that safety of personnel has to be balanced against high-quality analysis and timely reporting of results. The aim of this article is to present some recommendations for the handling of such specimens in the preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical phases of laboratory testing and analysis in an era of high COVID-19 prevalence, such as that seen, for example, in the UK, Spain, Italy and France.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: perspectives from an orthopaedic hospital. Purpose: Italy is one of the more severely affected countries in the world by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The aim of this report is to describe how COVID-19 affected the life and organization of one of the main orthopaedic hospitals of the country, and which measures were implemented to face the outbreak. Method(s): A personal interview has been conducted with four doctors involved in the management of COVID-19 outbreak in one of the main orthopaedic hospitals of Italy. Result(s): Hospital was re-organized, elective surgeries were cancelled, and only trauma surgeries were allowed, together with oncologic and urgent cases. Since the number of cases among patients and healthcare workers increased, the hospital management responded not only with a massive testing campaign aimed at detecting contact histories but also with an additional testing campaign for asymptomatic healthcare workers. Conclusion(s): The main lection is that any actions should be quick and decisive, for 1 week during the COVID-19 epidemic could make the difference.Copyright © 2020, SICOT aisbl.	false
0	Analysis of knowledge bases and research hotspots of coronavirus from the perspective of mapping knowledge domain. BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have drawn attention since the beginning of the 21st century. Over the past 17 years, coronaviruses have triggered several outbreaks of epidemic in people, which brought great threats to global public health security. We analyzed the publications on coronavirus with bibliometrics software and qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the knowledge base and hot topics of coronavirus research from 2003 to 2020. METHOD(S): We explored the publications on coronavirus in the Web of Science core collection (WOSCC) from 2003 to 2020. Bibliometric analysis, evaluating knowledge base, and research hotspots were performed based on CiteSpace V (Drexel University, Chaomei Chen). RESULT(S): There were a total of 8433 publications of coronavirus. The research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. The leading country was the United States, and the leading institution was the University of Hong Kong. The most productive researchers were: Yuen KY, Drosten C, Baric RS. The keywords analysis showed that SARS-CoV, infection, acute respiratory syndrome, antibody, receptor, and spike protein were research hotspots. The research categories analysis showed that virology, microbiology, veterinary sciences, infectious diseases, and biochemistry and molecular biology were hot research categories. CONCLUSION(S): Bibliometric analysis of the literature shows the research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. With the end of the epidemic, the research tended to be cooling. Virus identification, pathogenesis, and coronavirus-mediated diseases attracted much attention. We must continue studying the viruses after an outbreak ended.	false

0	Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in nuclear medicine departments: preliminary report of the first international survey. Purpose: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the availability of hospital resources worldwide. The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. Method(s): A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. Result(s): Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). Conclusion(s): According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals. New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Outcome of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients: A preliminary report from Northwestern Italy. Covid-19 pandemic is deeply affecting transplant activity worldwide. It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC	false
0	Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychological health problems in Chinese adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19. Psychological health problems, especially emotional disorders, are common among adolescents. The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.	false
0	Neutralizing Antibodies Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 Inpatients and Convalescent Patients. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic with no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines. The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging. METHOD(S): A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. Antibodies were determined with a modified cytopathogenic neutralization assay (NA) based on live SARS-CoV-2 and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different time points with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULT(S): The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6) by NA and 1:12441.7 (95% CI, 9754.5 to 15869.2) by ELISA. The antibody level by NA and ELISA peaked on day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-45, 46-60, and 61-84 had a higher neutralizing antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (beta=1.0470, P=0.0125; beta=1.0613, P=0.0307; beta=1.3713, P=0.0020). Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher neutralizing antibody titer (beta=0.4639, P=0.0227). CONCLUSION(S): The neutralizing antibodies were detected even at the early stage of disease, and a significant response showed in convalescent patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

0	Prevalence of comorbidities in patients and mortality cases affected by SARS-CoV2: a systematic review and meta-analysis. The new coronavirus, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Risk factors associated with this disease are age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and the mortality rate of COVID-19. We selected studies based upon epidemiological and clinical descriptions of the patients and mortality from the disease to determine the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in all patients and in mortality cases due to COVID-19. The pooled prevalence was estimated using the random effects model, and odds ratios were used to measure the probability of death for a patient with a comorbidity. The total prevalence of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 was 42% (95% CI: 25-60), 61% (95% CI: 42-80) in those admitted to the ICU, and 77% (95% CI: 68-86) among death cases; males were the most affected. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in all three groups studied, accounting for 32%, 26%, and 35%, respectively. The odds ratio of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to one with no comorbidity was 2.4 (P < 0.0001). The higher the prevalence of comorbidities the higher the odds that the COVID-19 patient will need intensive care or will die, especially if the pre-existing disease is hypertension, heart disease, or diabetes.	false
0	Focus on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since the first case of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, more than 2260 cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection and 803 related deaths have been reported since the 16th of October 2018. The vast majority of these cases (71%) were reported in Saudi Arabia but the epidemic has now spread to 27 countries and has not ceased 6 years later, unlike SARS-CoV that disappeared a little less than 2 years after emerging. Due to the high fatality rate observed in MERS-CoV infected patients (36%), much effort has been put into understanding the origin and pathophysiology of this novel coronavirus to prevent it from becoming endemic in humans. This review focuses in particular on the origin, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. The experience gained over recent years on how to manage the different risks related to this kind of epidemic will be key to being prepared for future outbreaks of communicable disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS	false
0	Contribution of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in spreading virus and targeted control strategies. The asymptomatic carrier state of COVID-19 has become a topic of concern for preventing the rebound of possible epidemic. This review describes and defines the COVID-19 asymptomatic carrier state and outlines the methods for identifying, counting and reporting of these cases. The author elaborates that the asymptomatic carrier state can be further divided into asymptomatic infection and pre-symptomatic infection after extended follow-up based on the nature of the disease progression. The author presents the limited available data about the infectivity of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases and their possible contributions to the overall epidemic of COVID-19 observed so far in China. Challenges of a possible second epidemic wave of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are discussed and suggestions for control strategies and scientific research are provided.	false
0	Pitfalls in SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of PCR tests are performed worldwide. Any deviation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will reduce the predictive values of the test. Here, we report the occurrence of contaminations of commercial primers/probe sets with the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence of the RT-qPCR as an example for pitfalls during PCR diagnostics affecting diagnostic specificity. In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations. As such, contaminations may have happened more widely, COVID-19 diagnostic results should be re-assessed retrospectively to validate the epidemiological basis for control measures.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic versus cirrhotic liver: a clinico-radiological comparative analysis. Aim To compare clinico-radiological pattern of non-cirrhotic versus cirrhotic HCC and correlate them with histopathological tumor grade. Materials and methods This prospective study was carried out on 94 patients enrolled following ultrasound diagnosis of a liver mass measuring > 3 cm. Multiphasic MDCT was performed on all treatment-naive cases and 56 cases with imaging pattern consistent with unifocal HCC were selected. Background liver parenchyma was assessed on ultrasound for cirrhosis and NAFLD. Cases were categorized into cirrhotic liver (CL) and non-cirrhotic liver (NCL) groups with 26 and 30 cases, respectively, and guided biopsy of each liver mass was performed. AFP levels were compared in both groups. Serum markers for hepatitis B and C were assessed. Masses in both groups were compared for morphology, attenuation on each phase and washout time. Presence of capsule, corona enhancement, satellite nodules and portal vein invasion was noted. Results AFP level was higher in CL group. HBV serum marker was raised in both groups. Most HCCs in NCL were moderately differentiated (histopathology), larger, had well-defined margins, showed mosaic pattern of enhancement, complete capsule and delayed phase washout. Majority in CL group were poorly differentiated, smaller, had ill-defined margins, showed heterogeneous enhancement, absent capsule and portal venous phase washout. Time of washout correlated with histopathological differentiation of masses, with earlier washout indicating poorer differentiation. Conclusion HCCs in NCL have different clinico-radiological characteristics than HCCs in CL. Time of contrast washout correlates with histopathological grade of HCC. Non-cirrhotic NAFLD may require formulation of new screening guidelines for HCC.	false

0	Symptomatology in head and neck district in coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A possible neuroinvasive action of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: The aim of this manuscript is to investigate transversally Ear Nose Throat (ENT) symptoms COVID-19 infection correlated and to study the neurotropism and neuroinvasiveness of the virus in the head-neck district through the investigation of the sense of smell, taste, tearing, salivation and hearing. Method(s): A total of 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in our study. For each patient we evaluated the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS), the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch Version (SXI-DV), The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED), Schirmer test I, the Hearing Handicap Inventory For Adults (HHIA) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). All the tests we carried out were performed during the active phase of the symptomatology from COVID-19 (Condition A) and 15 after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test negative (Condition B). Result(s): A total of 46 patients (92%) had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection. The 70% of patients reported gustatory disorders. Cough, fever, headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,001) in sQOD-NS, SXI-DV, SPEED, Schirmer test, HHIA and THI between Condition A and Condition B. Conclusion(s): In our population there was an alteration of the sense of taste, of the sense of smell, dry eyes and of the oral cavity and an auditory discomfort, symptoms probably linked to the neurotropism of the virus. Furthermore, anosmia, dysgeusia and xerostomia are early symptoms of COVID-19, which can be exploited for an early quarantine and a limitation of viral contagion.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical evaluation of a rapid colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 IgM/IgG. Background: Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. At present, diagnosis COVID-19 were based on real-time RT-PCR, which have to be performed in biosafe laboratory and is unsatisfactory for suspect case screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19. Objective(s): To evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body detection in suspected COVID-19 cases. Method(s): In the prospective cohort, 150 patients with fever or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang province, China, between January 20 to February 2, 2020. All patients were tested by the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for COVID-19. At least two samples of each patient were collected for RT-PCR assay analysis, and the PCR results were performed as the reference standard of diagnosis. Meanwhile 26 heathy blood donor were recruited. The sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatography assay test were evaluated. Subgroup analysis were performed with respect to age, sex, period from symptom onset and clinical severity. Result(s): The immunochromatography assay test had 69 positive result in the 97 PCR-positive cases, achieving sensitivity 71.1% [95% CI 0.609-0.797], and had 2 positive result in the 53 PCR-negative cases, achieving specificity 96.2% [95% CI 0.859-0.993]. In 26 healthy donor blood samples, the immunochromatography assay had 0 positive result. In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity was significantly higher in patients with symptoms more than 14 days 95.2% [95% CI 0.741-0.998] and patients with severe clinical condition 86.0% [95% CI 0.640-0.970]. Conclusion(s): The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG anti-body had 71.1% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity in this population, showing the potential for a useful rapid diagnosis test for COVID-19. Further investigations should be done to evaluate this assay in variety of clinical settings and populations.Copyright © 2020 E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical Recommendations for Epistaxis Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Epistaxis is a common complaint in the general population, and its treatment is a common procedure in emergency departments. In the COVID-19 era, procedures involving airway management are a particular risk for health care workers due to the high virulence of the virus, the transmission through aerosol, and the risk of contagion from asymptomatic patients. In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management. The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection. In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department. The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.	false
0	Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID): Study Design and Rationale. Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic developed, reports of neurological dysfunctions spanning the central and peripheral nervous systems have emerged. The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. Method(s): The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages <18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. Result(s): In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites. Conclusion(s): This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic. The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.	false
0	COVID-19, an opportunity to reevaluate the correlation between long-term effects of anthropogenic pollutants on viral epidemic/pandemic events and prevalence. Occupational, residential, dietary and environmental exposures to mixtures of synthetic anthropogenic chemicals after World War II have a strong relationship with the increase of chronic diseases, health cost and environmental pollution. The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	false
0	Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients. BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHOD(S): The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULT(S): In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.	false
0	From SARS to COVID-19: What we have learned about children infected with COVID-19. Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were firstly appeared in China. They have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological. To data, the researches have shown that their gene exhibit 79% of identical sequence and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There have been extensive research performed on SARS, however, the understanding of pathophysiology impact of Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) is still limited. In the review, we draw upon the lessons learnt from SARS in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and pathogenesis for further understand the features of COVID-19. By comparing these two diseases, we found, COVID-19 has quicker and wider transmission, obvious family agglomeration, higher morbidity and mortality. Newborns, asymptomatic children and normal chest imaging cases were emerged in COVID-19. Children started with gastrointestinal symptoms may progress to severe condition and newborn whose mother was infected with COVID-19 could have severe complications. The laboratory test data showed, the percentage of neutrophils and the level of LDH is higher, otherwise the number of CD4+ and CD8+T cells is decreased in children's COVID-19 cases. Based on these early observations, as pediatrician, we put forward some thoughts on children's COVID-19 and give some recommendations to contain the disease.Copyright © 2020.

0	Neurological complications of coronavirus and COVID-19. Introduction. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family has a certain tropism for the central nervous system. Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans. Development. Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions. Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.Copyright © 2020 Revista de Neurologia	false
0	Does pandemic justify the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in India?. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic against COVID-19 among health care workers and asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID. This is widely criticised as a hastily taken step with political inclination and minimal evidence backing. In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID-19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses. This has important public health implications which are discussed below. Better communication should have been planned to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. However, as a nation of 1.3 billion, we need to capitalize on this opportunity to generate data and valuable evidence on the use of HCQ to beat this pandemic. All health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial/observational study and get registered online to generate useful data related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients are under surveillance by the state and local health authorities and could also be roped into this study to generate robust evidence. Of course, pandemic does not just justify the use of HCQ, but pandemic is the time to innovate, think out of box and generate evidence to prove the same so that we can lives.

0	Postoperative fever in the time of COVID-19. Summary: Postoperative fever is common following orthopedic trauma surgery. As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.Copyright © 2020 Joule Inc. or its licensors.	false
0	Diffusion and Protein Corona Formation of Lipid-based Nanoparticles in Vitreous Humor: Profiling and Pharmacokinetic Considerations. The vitreous humor is the first barrier encountered by intravitreally injected nanoparticles. Lipid-based nanoparticles in vitreous are studied by evaluating their diffusion with single particle tracking technology and by characterizing their protein coronae with surface plasmon resonance and high-resolution proteomics. Single particle tracking results indicate that the vitreal mobility of the formulations is dependent on their charge. Anionic and neutral formulations are mobile, whereas larger (> 200 nm) neutral particles have restricted diffusion, and cationic particles are immobilized in vitreous. PEGylation increases the mobility of cationic and larger neutral formulations, but does not affect anionic and smaller neutral particles. Convection has a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles, whereas diffusion drives the transport of antibodies. Surface plasmon resonance studies determine that the vitreal corona of anionic formulations is sparse. Proteomics data reveals 76 differentially abundant proteins, whose enrichment is specific to either the hard or the soft corona. PEGylation does not affect protein enrichment. This suggests that protein-specific rather than formulation-specific factors are drivers of protein adsorption on nanoparticles in the vitreous. In summary, our findings contribute to understanding the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles in vitreous, and help advance development of nanoparticle-based treatments for eye diseases.	false
0	Effective Reproductive Number estimation for initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American Countries. Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic and turn in a challenge for Latin America. Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. Method(s): Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. Result(s): The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. Conclusion(s): The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt. Interventions such as domestic and international travel restrictions, educational institutions closure, social distancing, and intensified case surveillance should be adopted to prevent the collapse of the health systems.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Clinical and virologic characteristics of the first 12 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. Data on the detailed clinical progression of COVID-19 in conjunction with epidemiological and virological characteristics are limited. In this case series, we describe the first 12 US patients confirmed to have COVID-19 from 20 January to 5 February 2020, including 4 patients described previously1-3. Respiratory, stool, serum and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, viral culture and whole genome sequencing. Median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 patients were male. Common symptoms at illness onset were cough (n = 8) and fever (n = 7). Patients had mild to moderately severe illness; seven were hospitalized and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. No patients required mechanical ventilation and all recovered. All had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset. Lowest real-time PCR with reverse transcription cycle threshold values in the upper respiratory tract were often detected in the first week and SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from early respiratory specimens. These data provide insight into the natural history of SARS-CoV-2. Although infectiousness is unclear, highest viral RNA levels were identified in the first week of illness. Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness.Copyright © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.	false
0	Weathering the Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: Therapeutic Implications. BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged in Wuhan, Hubei-China, as responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and then spread rapidly worldwide. While most individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, approximately 5% develop severe forms of COVID-19 characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure (MOF) that usually require intensive-care support and often yield a poor prognosis., SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is far from being completely understood, and the lack of effective treatments leads to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions. The exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection, a condition known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, is emerging as the mechanism leading to ARDS and MOF in COVID-19, thus endorsing the hypothesis that properly timed anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies could improve patients' clinical outcomes and prognosis. Key Messages: The objective of this article is to explore and comment on the potential role of the promising immunomodulatory therapies using pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to overcome the dysregulated proinflammatory response in COVID-19.

0	Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of 1,420 European Patients with mild-to-moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019. Background: The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown. Objective(s): To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe. Method(s): Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. Result(s): 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers). The mean age of patients was 39.17+/-12.09 years. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). Fever was reported by on 45.4%. The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5+/-5.7 days. The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex. Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients. The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients. Conclusion(s): The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients. Olfactory dysfunction seems to be an important underestimated symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 that needs to be recognized as such by the WHO.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	COVID-19: In the footsteps of Ernest Shackleton. We describe what we believe is the first instance of complete COVID-19 testing of all passengers and crew on an isolated cruise ship during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 217 passengers and crew on board, 128 tested positive for COVID-19 on reverse transcription-PCR (59%). Of the COVID-19-positive patients, 19% (24) were symptomatic; 6.2% (8) required medical evacuation; 3.1% (4) were intubated and ventilated; and the mortality was 0.8% (1). The majority of COVID-19-positive patients were asymptomatic (81%, 104 patients). We conclude that the prevalence of COVID-19 on affected cruise ships is likely to be significantly underestimated, and strategies are needed to assess and monitor all passengers to prevent community transmission after disembarkation.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	Urologic Surgery and COVID-19: How the Pandemic Is Changing the Way We Operate. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact on all aspects of health care, including surgical procedures. For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission. Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality. Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect health care workers and ensure an adequate workforce. For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available. The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus. Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures for COVID-19 positive patients or when COVID status is unknown. Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Ultra-low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission. Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures. COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection. Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced. Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.	false
0	Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.Copyright © 2020	false
0	The liver injury and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Backgrounds: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. Our study aimed to evaluate the association of liver injury and gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) with the progression of COVID-19. Method(s): A comprehensive search was performed on the PubMed to identify eligible studies that summarized the liver injury and GIS in COVID-19. Result(s): A total of 21 studies with 3024 patients were included. Up to 53% patients had liver dysfunctions and the degree of liver damage was associated the severity of the disease. The prevalence of diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain in patients with COVID-19 were 9.1%, 5.2% and 3.5%, respectively. No significant was found in the prevalence of diarrhoea (OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 0.90 to 1.72; I2 = 0%, P = 0.19) and nausea/vomiting (OR, 1.24; 95%CI, 0.57 to 2.69; I2 = 61%, P = 0.58) between severe and non-severe patients. In addition, diarrhoea (OR, 1.22; 95%CI, 0.50 to 2.98; I2 = 0%, P = 0.66) and nausea/vomiting (OR, 1.09; 95%CI, 0.46 to 2.62; I2 = 0%, P = 0.84) were not associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion(s): The incidences of GIS in patients with COVID-19 is relatively low and are not associated with the COVID-19 progression. Gastroenterologists should pay more attention to the liver injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 during the course of infection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS	false
0	"Endoscopy during the Covid-19 outbreak: experience and recommendations from a single center in a high-incidence scenario. A dramatic SARS-Cov-2 outbreak is hitting Italy hard. To face the new scenario all the hospitals have been re-organised in order to reduce all the outpatient services and to devote almost all their personnel and resources to the management of Covid-19 patients. As a matter of fact, all the services have undergone a deep re-organization guided by: the necessity to reduce exams, to create an environment that helps reduce the virus spread, and to preserve the medical personnel from infection. In these days a re-organization of the endoscopic unit, sited in a high-incidence area, has been adopted, with changes to logistics, work organization and patients selection. With the present manuscript, we want to support gastroenterologists and endoscopists in the organization of a ""new"" endoscopy unit that responds to the ""new"" scenario, while remaining fully aware that resources, availability and local circumstances may extremely vary from unit to unit.Copyright © 2020 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l."	false
0	"Interventions for treatment of COVID-19: A protocol for a living systematic review with network meta-analysis including individual patient data (The LIVING Project). Background: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe. No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19. Methods/design: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an ""active"" comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or ""active placebo"") for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). Discussion(s): COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.

Purpose: Given incomplete data reporting by race, we used data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in US counties to describe racial disparities in COVID-19 disease and death and associated determinants. Method(s): Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Result(s): Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents. Conclusion(s): Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).	false
0	Evaluation of commercial and automated SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs using coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient samples. Antibody-screening methods to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) need to be validated. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs in conjunction with the EUROLabworkstation (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Overall specificities were 91.9% and 73.0% for IgG and IgA ELISAs, respectively. Of 39 coronavirus disease patients, 13 were IgG and IgA positive and 11 IgA alone at sampling. IgGs and IgAs were respectively detected at a median of 12 and 11 days after symptom onset.Copyright © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). All rights reserved.	false
0	The underpinning biology relating to multiple sclerosis disease modifying treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19 that can result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can cause significant mortality, leading to concern that immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis and other disorders have significant risks for both infection and ARDS. Objective(s): To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. Observations: Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. Implications: In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © 2020	false

We thank our colleagues for their constructive discussion on our recently published study1. Regarding prevalence, indeed, growing literature yields a variable frequency of loss of smell (LOS) in Covid-19 patients, that may be hypothetically due to differences in the location and amount of viral load, to the different immune response between younger mild-symptomatic outpatients (higher prevalence) and more severely affected inpatients (lower prevalence)1,2, and to the variable methods of measurement.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

0	Incidental COVID-19 Pneumonia on 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT. We present the case of a patient who underwent F-fluorocholine PET/CT for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in which bilateral pneumonia was diagnosed. In the current state of COVID-19 pandemic, a high prevalence of incidental pneumonia may be expected, even with previous clinical triage, explained by a nondefined number of patients who were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic for infectious process. Therefore, nuclear medicine physicians should be prepared to recognize and diagnose incidental COVID-19 pneumonia manifestation on F-fluorocholine PET/CT, due to the crucial epidemiological implications.	false
0	Molecular, serological, and biochemical diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19: IFCC taskforce evaluation of the latest evidence. The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment. Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers. In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management. This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic. Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.Copyright © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.	false
0	How would you like your COVID-19? From a host with mild course disease, or from a severe one?. The clinical course of COVID-19 presents a broad spectrum, being asymptomatic in some individuals while following a severe course and resulting in mortality in others. It is known that such factors as age and chronic diseases can result in a different clinical courses in individuals, however, variable clinical courses among the similar individuals in terms of age and chronic diseases are also seen. Other possible factors affecting the course of the disease that are mostly speculative or under investigation are genetic factors and the origin of transmission or possible subtype of novel coronavirus. Whether the source of transmission is important in the clinical course of the disease is unknown. A case series composed of seven individuals in a similar age group, with different lines of descent and different genetic structures, but who were infected from the same source is presented here. The similar and different clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of the cases residing in the same nursing home, who presented to the hospital altogether, were evaluated. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the source of transmission is influential in the clinical course of the disease.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.	false
0	'Scientific Strabismus' or Two Related Pandemics: COVID-19 & Vitamin D Deficiency. World Health Organization announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature, and humidity i.e. similar to the behavior of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern midlatitude countries with an average temperature of 5-11 degreeC and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in the Europe.Regardless of age, ethnicity, and latitude; recent data showed that 40% of the Europeans are Vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L), and 13% are severely deficient (25(OH)D <30 nmol/L).A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of Vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and midlatitude countries than the tropical and high latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe Vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia; 46%, Qatar; 46%, Iran; 33.4%, Chile; 26.4%) and midlatitude (France; 27.3%, Portugal; 21.2% and Austria; 19.3%) regions. Severe Vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0% in some high latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands).Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe Vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic Vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.Copyright © The Authors 2020.	false
0	Back-projection of COVID-19 diagnosis counts to assess infection incidence and control measures: Analysis of Australian data. Back-projection is an epidemiological analysis method that was developed to estimate HIV incidence using surveillance data on AIDS diagnoses. It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts. Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period. This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia. It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns. For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels. These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures. It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a 5-fold increase in total infections. Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed. Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

0	Will plant-made biopharmaceuticals play a role in the fight against COVID-19?. Given the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to divulge all the available technologies with the potential to fight against this virus. Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis. The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results. Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines. In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks. The key aspects that will define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	false
0	COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: A need for prudence in elderly patients from a pooled analysis. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the pooled estimate of diabetes prevalence in young (<50 years) versus elderly (>50 years) COVID-19 cohorts. Method(s): Studies published between December-2019 and March-2020 reporting demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases were identified. A total of 11 studies included accounting for 2084 COVID-19 patients. Result(s): The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients with a mean age>50 years was 13.2%, whereas studies with relatively younger patients (mean age <50 years) had a pooled prevalence of 9.0% Conclusion(s): The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients was found to be 13.2% with studies including relatively elderly patients showing higher rates of diabetes. The intermingled effects of diabetes with other cardiovascular comorbidities warrant age-specific outcomes data including the impact of ongoing antidiabetic treatment.Copyright © 2020 Diabetes India	false
0	Confirmation of the high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19: An updated analysis. Introduction: We recently reported a high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three Dutch hospitals. In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses. Method(s): We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first. Result(s): We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41-57%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12). Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8). Conclusion(s): In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright © 2020	false
0	Electrolyte imbalances in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Background: Early studies have reported various electrolyte abnormalities at admission in patients who progress to the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As electrolyte imbalance may not only impact patient care, but provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we aimed to analyse all early data reported on electrolytes in COVID-19 patients with and without severe form. Method(s): An electronic search of Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science was performed for articles comparing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium) between COVID-19 patients with and without severe disease. A pooled analysis was performed to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval. Result(s): Five studies with a total sample size of 1415 COVID-19 patients. Sodium was significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.91 mmol/L [95% CI: -1.33 to -0.50 mmol/L]). Similarly, potassium was also significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (WMD: -0.12 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.18 to -0.07 mmol/L], I2=33%). For chloride, no statistical differences were observed between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (WMD: 0.30 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.41 to 1.01 mmol/L]). For calcium, a statistically significant lower concentration was noted in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.20 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.25 to -0.20 mmol/L]). Conclusion(s): This pooled analysis confirms that COVID-19 severity is associated with lower serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium. We recommend electrolytes be measured at initial presentation and serially monitored during hospitalization in order to establish timely and appropriate corrective actions.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	Australian and New Zealand consensus statement on the management of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myeloma during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge to the care of patients with haematological malignancies. Viral pneumonia is known to cause disproportionately severe disease in patients with cancer, and patients with lymphoma, myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are likely to be at particular risk of severe disease related to COVID-19. This statement has been developed by consensus among authors from Australia and New Zealand. We aim to provide supportive guidance to clinicians making individual patient decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during periods that access to healthcare resources may be limited. General recommendations include those to minimise patient exposure to COVID-19, including the use of telehealth, avoidance of non-essential visits and minimisation of time spent by patients in infusion suites and other clinical areas. This statement also provides recommendations where appropriate in assessing indications for therapy, reducing therapy-associated immunosuppression and reducing healthcare utilisation in patients with specific haematological malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific decisions regarding therapy of haematological malignancies will need to be individualised, based on disease risk, risks of immunosuppression, rates of community transmission of COVID-19 and available local healthcare resources.Copyright © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians	false
0	Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with leptomeningeal enhancement following SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTRODUCTION: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically present with respiratory symptoms, but little is known about the disease's potential neurological complications.We report a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, in association with leptomeningeal enhancement. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman presented with recent unsteadiness and paraesthesia in both hands. Fifteen days earlier, she complained of fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Her chest X-ray showed a lobar consolidation and PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; she was admitted due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia.In the first 48 hours of hospitalisation, she started to experience lumbar pain and weakness of the proximal lower extremities, progressing to bilateral facial nerve palsy, oropharyngeal weakness and severe proximal tetraparesis with cervical flexion 2/5 on the MRC scale. A full spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a brainstem and cervical leptomeningeal enhancement. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albumin-cytological dissociation. Microbiological studies on CSF, including SARS-CoV-2, were negative. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, with significant neurological improvement noted over the next 2 weeks. CONCLUSION(S): Leptomeningeal enhancement is an atypical feature in GBS, but could be a marker of its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

0	A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine. Whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown. METHOD(S): We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis. We enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure). Within 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days). The primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days. RESULT(S): We enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants. Overall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact. The incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was -2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 2.2; P=0.35). Side effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSION(S): After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.

0	Consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for neurologists. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally. Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed. They become silent contagious sources or 'virus spreaders'. In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID-19. It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

0	A precision medicine approach to managing 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin as a therapeutic option for deteriorating patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China. Until now, no definite effective treatment has been identified. We reported on 3 patients with severe COVID-19 who received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with satisfactory recovery. Based on these observations, randomized studies of high-dose IVIg should be considered in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.	false
0	To Do or Not to Do?-A Review of Cancer Surgery Triage Guidelines in COVID-19 Pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global health emergency involving more than 200 countries so far. The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality. This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries. Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome. During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic. Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative. China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic. Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients. Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data. Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients. In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors. While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means. Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward.Copyright © 2020, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.	false

Here, we describe a serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the screening and identification of human SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters. This assay does not require the handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types in serum and plasma and is amenable to scaling. Serological assays are of critical importance to help define previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in populations, identify highly reactive human donors for convalescent plasma therapy and investigate correlates of protection.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.	false
0	Inappropriate Nasopharyngeal Sampling for SARS-CoV-2 Detection Is a Relevant Cause of False-Negative Reports. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA on nasopharyngeal swab is the standard for diagnosing active COVID-19 disease in asymptomatic cases and in symptomatic patients without the typical radiologic findings. For the present COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, we describe 4 symptomatic patients with negative RT-PCR results at the first nasopharyngeal swab, which became positive when collected a few hours later by an otolaryngologist. All the patients showed nasal obstruction. The present report suggests that inadequate nasopharyngeal sampling performed by untrained operators in the presence of nasal obstruction can be a relevant case of false-negative findings at RT-PCR, with a clear negative impact on the efforts to contain the current outbreak.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.	false

0	Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Background: A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective(s): To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Method(s): The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Result(s): Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusion(s): The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.Copyright © 2020	false
0	COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019) - recent trends. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARSCoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARSCoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.	false
0	Clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 in children aged <18 years in Jiangxi, China: an analysis of 23 cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged <18 years. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020. RESULT(S): Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged <18 years.	false

Considering numerical simulations, this study shows that the so-called vertical social distancing health policy is ineffective to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"". Our analysis considers the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, but similar conclusions apply to other cities as well. Code implementation of the model in R-language is provided in the supplementary material."	false
0	Climate factors and incidence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Background: Our understanding of climate factors and their links to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks is incomplete. This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. Method(s): The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 degreeN, 46.6753 degreeE). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. Result(s): A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 +/- 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from April to August. The highest peak timing positioned in August 2015, followed by April 2014, June 2017, March 2015, and June 2016. High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043-1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331-1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948-0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912-0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. Conclusion(s): The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.Copyright © 2019 The Authors	false
