[Diagnostics and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children : season 2].,"Asner, Sandra A; Posfay-Barbe, Klara M","Some uncertainties remain regarding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic procedures and seroprevalence studies in children. RT-PCR assays conducted on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic in children as in adults. Saliva samples might replace soon NP swabs as similar sensitivities have been reported from both samples in adults, but not yet in children. Rapid antigen testing is currently performed on NP swabs collected from children within 4 days of their symptom onset. Serology testing is an essential diagnostic tool in seroprevalence studies, which might guide in the future public health decisions.",2021,/,Revue medicale suisse,17,726,340-343,,,33599409,#81213,Asner 2021,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""
Longitudinal serology in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India – a prospective cohort study,"Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Chattopadhyay, Souvick; Mehdi, Farha; Desiraju, Bapu Koundinya; Chaudhuri, Susmita; Singh, Savita; Bhartia, Vandita; Kshetrapal, Pallavi; Natchu, Uma Chandra Mouli; Wadhwa, Nitya; Sopory, Shailaja; Wahi, Mudita; Pandey, Anil; Das, Asim; Anand, Nidhi; Sharma, Nandini; Sharma, Pragya; Saxena, Sonal; Sindhu, Deepa; Sindhu, Brahmdeep; Sharma, Dharmendra; Dang, Navin; Batra, Gaurav; Kang, Gagandeep; Bhatnagar, Shinjini; =for DBT India Consortium for COVID-19 Research","Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are now widely available, but there are few data on longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly from low-and middle-income countries. We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3840 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India, to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The IgG responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0-7, 10-28 days and 6-10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates in the post-infection windows of 0–7 days, 10–28 days and 6–10 weeks were 46%, 84.7% and 85.3% respectively (n=782). The proportion with a serological response increased with severity of COVID-19 disease. All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values in the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR in a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (p value: 0.48), with similar results among non-seroconverters (p value: 0.16) (n=169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a period of ten weeks from South Asia. The low seropositivity in asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys. <h4>Summary</h4> We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC protein IgG in a multi-hospital-based prospective cohort from northern India up to ten weeks post-infection. The lower seroconversion rate among asymptomatic RT-PCR positive participants has public health significance particularly for interpreting community seroprevalence estimates.",2021,,,,,,PPR279544,10.1101/2021.02.04.21251140,,#80604,Thiruvengadam 2021,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients Based on the Results of Nucleic Acid and Specific Antibodies and the Clinical Relevance of Antibody Levels,"Chen, H.; Qin, R. D.; Huang, Z. F.; He, L.; Luo, W. T.; Zheng, P. Y.; Huang, H. M.; Wang, H.; Sun, B. Q.","Combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody testing is often required in the diagnosis of COVID-19, but whether patients with different nucleic acid and antibody results have different laboratory parameters, severities and clinical outcomes, has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Thus, according to different groups of nucleic acid and antibody results, we aimed to investigate the differences in demographic characteristics, and laboratory parameters among the different groups and predict their clinical outcomes. In our study, nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acids and antibodies were detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and chemiluminescence, respectively. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 with different severities, were divided into the PCR(+)Ab(+), PCR(+)Ab(-), and PCR(-)Ab(+) groups. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were compared among the three groups. The correlation of antibodies with laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes was also explored, and antibodies were used to predict the timing of nucleic acid conversion. We found that a total of 364 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, a total of 184, 37, and 143 patients were assigned to the PCR(+)Ab(+), PCR(+)Ab(-), and PCR(-)Ab(+) groups, respectively. Compared to patients in the PCR(+)Ab(-) or PCR- Ab(+) groups, patients in the PCR(+)Ab(+) group presented worse symptoms, more comorbidities, more laboratory abnormalities, and worse clinical outcomes (P < 0.05). In addition, the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA were all significantly correlated with the days of hospitalization, days of PCR turning negative, and multiple laboratory parameters (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, combined IgM, IgA, and IgG predicted the days of PCR turning negative within 1 week. The best performance was achieved when the cut-off values of IgM, IgG, and IgA were 3.2, 1.8 and 0.5, respectively, with a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 82%. In conclusion, COVID-19 patients who were both positive for nucleic acids and antibodies presented with worse clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, and clinical outcomes. The three specific antibodies were positively correlated with clinical outcomes and most laboratory parameters. Furthermore, antibody levels can predict the time of nucleic acid conversion.",2021,Jan,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,7,,,WOS:000611973400001,10.3389/fmolb.2020.605862,,#82697,Chen 2021,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Rapid community point-of-care testing for COVID-19 (RAPTOR-C19): protocol for a platform diagnostic study.,"Nicholson, Brian D; Hayward, Gail; Turner, Philip J; Lee, Joseph J; Deeks, Alexandra; Logan, Mary; Moore, Abigail; Seeley, Anna; Fanshawe, Thomas; Oke, Jason; Koshiaris, Constantinos; Sheppard, James P; Hoang, Uy; Parimalanathan, Vaishnavi; Edwards, George; Liyange, Harshana; Sherlock, Julian; Byford, Rachel; Zambon, Maria; Ellis, Joanna; Bernal, Jamie Lopez; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Linley, Ezra; Borrow, Ray; Howsam, Gary; Baines, Sophie; Ferreira, Filipa; de Lusignan, Simon; Perera, Rafael; Hobbs, F D Richard","BACKGROUND: The aim of RApid community Point-of-care Testing fOR COVID-19 (RAPTOR-C19) is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of multiple current and emerging point-of-care tests (POCTs) for active and past SARS-CoV2 infection in the community setting. RAPTOR-C19 will provide the community testbed to the COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR)., METHODS: RAPTOR-C19 incorporates a series of prospective observational parallel diagnostic accuracy studies of SARS-CoV2 POCTs against laboratory and composite reference standards in patients with suspected current or past SARS-CoV2 infection attending community settings. Adults and children with suspected current SARS-CoV2 infection who are having an oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptase Digital/Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (d/rRT-PCR) as part of clinical care or community-based testing will be invited to participate. Adults (>= 16 years) with suspected past symptomatic infection will also be recruited. Asymptomatic individuals will not be eligible. At the baseline visit, all participants will be asked to submit samples for at least one candidate point-of-care test (POCT) being evaluated (index test/s) as well as an OP/NP swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR performed by Public Health England (PHE) (reference standard for current infection). Adults will also be asked for a blood sample for laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by PHE (reference standard for past infection), where feasible adults will be invited to attend a second visit at 28 days for repeat antibody testing. Additional study data (e.g. demographics, symptoms, observations, household contacts) will be captured electronically. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for each POCT will be calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals when compared to the reference standard. POCTs will also be compared to composite reference standards constructed using paired antibody test results, patient reported outcomes, linked electronic health records for outcomes related to COVID-19 such as hospitalisation or death, and other test results., DISCUSSION: High-performing POCTs for community use could be transformational. Real-time results could lead to personal and public health impacts such as reducing onward household transmission of SARS-CoV2 infection, improving surveillance of health and social care staff, contributing to accurate prevalence estimates, and understanding of SARS-CoV2 transmission dynamics in the population. In contrast, poorly performing POCTs could have negative effects, so it is necessary to undertake community-based diagnostic accuracy evaluations before rolling these out., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN14226970.",2021,/,Diagnostic and prognostic research,5,1,4,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41512-021-00093-8,33557927,#79017,Nicholson 2021,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""

Excess Deaths in the COVID-19 Pandemic in India,"Sane, Renuka; Shah, Ajay","Background: Excess death estimates, reflecting a combination of covid- 19 and non-covid-19 factors, are required to understand the full impact of the pandemic. Relatively little is known about excess deaths in low and middle income countries (LMIC) owing to weaknesses of official statistics on number of deaths and causes of death. India has the second largest number of covid-19 infections globally and is thus an important LMIC. We contribute to the measurement of two key facts: all causes excess deaths and an upper bound for the IFR. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) is a panel survey dataset across India carried out three times a year. The survey has demographic, economic, and health information about 170,000 households and 600,000 individuals. We use this to estimate excess deaths in the April - August 2020 period across India. We examine correlations between member characteristics such as age, sex, health conditions, urban or rural residence, and economic profile, with the probability of death. We juxtapose this estimated excess death rate with estimates from a seroprevalance survey for the same household dataset, in the state of Karnataka (which has a population of 64 million), to estimate an upper bound for the IFR. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The average annualised crude death rate for May - August 2015-2019 was 8.293 per 1000. This increased to 15.02 per 1000 in May - August 2020. This suggests an annualised excess death rate of 6.7 per 1000. There is a certain divergence of correlations with mortality with member characteristics such as gender, age and income class, as compared with what may be expected with covid-19 related deaths. The estimated upper bound for the IFR in the state of Karnataka is 1.3%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: This rise in all-causes deaths, and the socioeconomic characteristics associated with mortality, can help shape improved responses on the part of health policy in understanding the vulnerable and modifying policies to address the problems. These methods can be applied with some panel datasets in other LMIC in order to estimate similar quantities. These results hint at a significant role for non-covid-19 factors in the increased deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: None.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The work does not involve primary data collection.

Changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike versus nucleoprotein antibody responses impact the estimates of infections in population-based seroprevalence studies,Fenwick C.; Croxatto A.; Coste A.T.; Pojer F.; Andre C.; Pellaton C.; Farina A.; Campos J.; Hacker D.; Lau K.; Bosch B.-J.; Nussle S.G.; Bochud M.; DAcremont V.; Trono D.; Greub G.; Pantaleoa G. ,"A B S T R A C T Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses to the spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form, or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n 93) and in individuals enrolled in a postinfection seroprevalence population study (n 578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein, or within a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute-infection-phase samples. Interestingly, compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the postinfection cohort. Seroprevalence in a ""positive patient contacts"" group (n 177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2%, while the ""randomly selected"" general population group (n 311) was reduced by up to 45% relative to the S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and postinfection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection, but that responses against N appear to wane in the postinfection phase where those against the S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and postinfection phases used the native S protein trimer as the binding antigen, which has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.Copyright © 2021 Fenwick et al.

Biases because of varying test accuracy, results of ongoing large-scale serological studies, and use of antibody testing for monitoring development of herd immunity are summarized. Although current SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing efforts have generated valuable insights, the accuracy of serological tests and the selection criteria for the tested cohorts need to be evaluated carefully.

Anti-RBD geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) progressively increased between month one (74.2 U/ml [95%CI 62.7-87.8), three (103.2 U/ml [95%CI 87.9-121.2]; p<0.001), and six (123.3 U/ml [95%CI 103.4-147.0]; p<0.001) in the whole cohort. Anti-N antibodies were detectable in >97% at all times. Neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 99.5% (195/196) of participants at six months post infection. Their GMC progressively decreased between months one (20.1 AU/ml [95%CI 16.9-24.0]), three (15.2 AU/ml [95%CI 13.2-17.6]; p<0.001) and six (9.4 AU/ml [95%CI 7.7-11.4]; p<0.001). RBD-ACE2 inhibiting antibody titers and anti-RBD antibody concentrations strongly correlated at each timepoint (all r>0.86, p<0.001). Disease severity was associated with higher initial anti-RBD and RBD-ACE2 inhibiting antibody titers, but not with their kinetics., CONCLUSION: Neutralizing antibodies persisted at six months in almost all participants, indicating more durability than initially feared. Anti-RBD antibodies persisted better and even increased over time, possibly related to the preferential detection of progressively higher-affinity antibodies.

Modeling the asymptomatic prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and the ISTAT survey,"Traini, Marco Claudio; Caponi, Carla; Ferrari, Riccardo; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio","objectives: August 3rd, 2020, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) presented preliminary results of seroprevalence survey on the percentage of individuals affected by Covid-19. The survey aims to define (within the entire population of Italy) the portion of individuals that developed an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. For the first time one has an estimate of the asymptomatic infected population and the possibility to acknowledge its potential role in the infection spread in Italy, one of the most affected areas in Europe. The information obtained allow a particularly sensitive validation of epidemiological models which include the asymptomatic class. methods: The present study is devoted to the construction of a model able to simulate, in a systematic way, the asymptomatic group whose relevance in the, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, has been recently investigated and discussed. The investigation involves the description of the first epidemic outbreak in Italy as well as the predictive analysis of the ongoing second wave. In particular the possible correction to the data of the serological tests because of their sensitivity and specificity. results: The model: taken as an example of the models presently used, satisfactory reproduces the data of the ISTAT survey showing a relevant predictive power and relegating in a secondary position models which do not include, in the simulation, the presence of asymptomatic groups. The corrections due to the serological test sensitivity (in particular those ones depending on the symptoms onset) make the comparison between data and models less accurate. conclusions: The predictions of the model confirm a relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals also during the second pandemic wave in Italy. The ratio of reported to unreported cases is predicted to be roughly 1:4. A more detailed knowledge of the results of the survey could allow to correct, in a relevant way, the data by means of the experimental evidences on the antibodies sensibility. The model analyses of the vaccination strategies, confirms the relevance of a massive administration with the beginning of the year to arrive at the end of the infection within August 2021.",2021,,,,,,PPR276228,10.1101/2021.01.27.21250597,,#77360,Traini 2021,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""
Association between regional distributions of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and out-of-hospital sudden death during the first epidemic outbreak in New York,Coleman K.M.; Saleh M.; Mountantonakis S.E. ,"BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHOD(S): The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULT(S): Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman rho 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION(S): The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.Copyright © 2020 Heart Rhythm Society.

B cell responses to these ""common cold"" viruses remain incompletely understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2' cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors.

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design. Method(s): Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382. Finding(s): Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0.40% (95% credible interval 0.29-0.54) to 0.06% (0.04-0.07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time. Interpretation(s): Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

We examined the possible complementary role of lab developed class-specific clinical serology in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. Serological tests for IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using samples from real time RT PCR (qRT-PCR)-confirmed in-patient COVID-19 cases. We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed a higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients when compared to IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve (AUC): 0.91; 95%CI 0.89 to 0.93 vs. IgA AUC: 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98 vs. IgM AUC: 0.95; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first two weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.

The assays, COVIDAR IgG and IgM, which were produced and provided for free to health authorities, private and public health institutions and nursing homes, use a combination of a trimer stabilized spike protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in a single enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. Over half million tests have already been distributed to detect and quantify antibodies for multiple purposes, including assessment of immune responses in hospitalized patients and large seroprevalence studies in neighborhoods, slums and health care workers, which resulted in a powerful tool for asymptomatic detection and policy making in the country. Analysis of antibody levels and longitudinal studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in over one thousand patient samples provided insightful information about IgM and IgG seroconversion time and kinetics, and IgM waning profiles. At least 35% of patients showed seroconversion within 7 days, and 95% within 45 days of symptoms onset, with simultaneous or close sequential IgM and IgG detection. Longitudinal studies of asymptomatic cases showed a wide range of antibody responses with median levels below those observed in symptomatic patients. Regarding convalescent plasma applications, a protocol was standardized for the assessment of end point IgG antibody titers with COVIDAR with more than 500 plasma donors. The protocol showed a positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titers, and was used for clinical trials and therapies across the country. Using this protocol, about 80% of convalescent donor plasmas were potentially suitable for therapies.

COVID-19 testing in outbreak free care homes: What are the public health benefits?.,"Green, R; Tulloch, J S P; Tunnah, C; Coffey, E; Lawrenson, K; Fox, A; Mason, J; Barnett, R; Constantine, A; Shepherd, W; Ashton, M; Beadsworth, M B J; Vivancos, R; Hall, I; Walker, N; Ghebrehewet, S","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 care home outbreaks represent a significant proportion of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the UK. National testing initially focused on symptomatic care home residents, before extending to asymptomatic cohorts., AIM: The aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in outbreak free care homes., METHODS: A two-point prevalence survey of COVID-19, in 34 Liverpool care homes, was performed in April and May 2020. Changes in prevalence were analysed. Associations between care home characteristics, reported infection, prevention and control interventions, and COVID-19 status were described and analysed., FINDINGS: No resident developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study. There was no significant difference between: the number of care homes containing at least one test positive resident between the first (17.6%, 95%CI 6.8-34.5) and second round (14.7%, 95%CI 5.0-31.1) of testing (p>0.99); and the number of residents testing positive between the first (2.1%, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and second round (1.0%, 95%CI 0.5-2.1) of testing (p=0.11). Care homes providing nursing care (RR 7.99, 95%CI 1.1-57.3) and employing agency staff (RR 8.4, 95%CI 1.2-60.8) were more likely to contain test positive residents. Closing residents shared space was not associated with residents testing positive (RR 2.63, 95%CI 0.4-18.5)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 care homes showed no evidence of disease transmission or development of outbreaks; suggesting that current infection prevention and control measures are effective in preventing transmission. Repeat testing at 2-3 weeks had limited or no public health benefits over regular daily monitoring of staff and residents for symptoms. These results should inform policies calling for regular testing of asymptomatic residents. Copyright © 2021.

Infection is associated with development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity that can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be called upon to produce antibodies upon re-infection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection. We find that IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody titres decrease significantly with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells is unchanged. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies they express have greater somatic hypermutation, increased potency and resistance to RBD mutations, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Analysis of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), using immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction, revealed persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 volunteers.

Age is not a disease: Evolution of protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in seniors from the Brevnice nursing home.,"Fejt, Vaclav; Kratka, Zuzana; Zelena, Hana; Furst, Tomas","In the nursing home in Brevnice, 21 out of 23 seniors were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the spring of 2020. Three of them died from the infection. This study monitors the antibodies formation in group of seniors who have overcome the infection. Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA). Six months from the infection, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 18 out of 20 seniors. High levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with higher levels of immunoglobulins and were a good predictor of an increase of IgG in the autumn during the second wave of the epidemic in the Czech Republic. During the autumn wave, neither any of the clients, nor any staff contracted the virus, although the prevalence of PCR positivity in the Vysocina region reached around 5 %. The antigen tests also came out all negative. This study shows that in the senior population, the production of protective antibodies follows a normal pattern, and the seniors are probably immune to a repeated infection for at least 8 months from the first infection. Based on these results, we would like to open the discussion on the testing for seroprevalence in nursing homes, possible changes to the epidemiologic regime in relation to the risk of infection, and about vaccination schemes in these centers.",2020,/,Casopis lekaru ceskych,159,7-8,303-311,,,33445937,#73322,Fejt 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Extremely Low Prevalence of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Among Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients in Israeli Hospitals: a Cross-sectional Study,Temkin E. ,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among clinical staff in designated COVID-19 units vs. that among staff in similar units without known or suspected COVID-19 patients. METHOD(S): We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers (HCW) in 8 Israeli general hospitals. The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. We surveyed HCW in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) from April 30-May 7, 2020. RESULT(S): There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95% CI: 0.005%-1.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2: an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unit. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCW with confirmed COVID-19 in the two weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit. CONCLUSION(S): The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 among HCW, coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID-19 acquired during patient care, suggest that. Israel's national guidelines for personal protective equipment, which are consistent with those of the World Health Organization, adequately protect HCW.Copyright © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

We aimed to determine the proportion IgG seronegative and predictors for seronegativity among persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: We analyzed serologic data collected from health care workers and first responders in New York City and the Detroit metropolitan area with history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result and who were tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at least 2 weeks after symptom onset., RESULTS: Of 2,547 persons with previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 160 (6.3%) were seronegative. Of 2,112 previously symptomatic persons, the proportion seronegative slightly increased from 14 to 90 days post symptom onset (p=0.06). The proportion seronegative ranged from 0% among 79 persons previously hospitalized to 11.0% among 308 persons with asymptomatic infections. In a multivariable model, persons taking immunosuppressive medications were more likely to be seronegative (31.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7%-64.7%), while participants of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (versus non-Hispanic White) (2.7%, 95% CI 1.5%-4.8%), with severe obesity (versus under/normal weight) (3.9%, 95% CI 1.7%-8.6%), or with more symptoms were less likely to be seronegative., CONCLUSIONS: In our population with previous RT-PCR confirmed infection, approximately one in 16 persons lacked IgG antibodies. Absence of antibodies varied independently by illness severity, race/ethnicity, obesity, and immunosuppressive drug therapy. The proportion seronegative remained relatively stable among persons tested up to 90 days post symptom onset.

"The infection rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: Combined analysis of population samples",Qu H.-Q.; Cheng Z.J.; Duan Z.; Tian L.; Hakonarson H. ,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Wuhan had a much higher mortality rate than the rest of China. However, a large number of asymptomatic infections in Wuhan may have never been diagnosed, contributing to an overestimated mortality rate. Objective(s): This study aims to obtain an accurate estimate of infections in Wuhan using internet data. Method(s): In this study, we performed a combined analysis of the infection rate among evacuated foreign citizens to estimate the infection rate in Wuhan in late January and early February. Result(s): Based on our analysis, the combined infection rate of the foreign evacuees was 0.013 (95% CI 0.008-0.022). Therefore, we estimate the number of infected people in Wuhan to be 143,000 (range 88,000-242,000), which is significantly higher than previous estimates. Our study indicates that a large number of infections in Wuhan were not diagnosed, which has resulted in an overestimated case fatality rate. Conclusion(s): Increased awareness of the original infection rate of Wuhan is critical for proper public health measures at all levels, as well as to eliminate panic caused by overestimated mortality rates that may bias health policy actions by the authorities.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Joint Detection of Serum IgM/IgG Antibody Is an Important Key to Clinical Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,"Hu, Fang; Shang, Xiaoling; Chen, Meizhou; Zhang, Changliang","Background: This study was aimed to investigate the application of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection., Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-CoV-2 infected, confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. Nine patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-CoV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients., Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101), respectively, and the sensitivity was 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68), respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies was 98.53% (67/68)., Conclusion: Combined detection of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies had better sensitivity compared with single IgM or IgG antibody testing, which can be used as an important diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection and a screening tool of potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers in clinics, hospitals, and accredited scientific laboratories.

Sensitivity and specificity of lateral flow antigen test kits for covid-19 in asymptomatic population of quarantine centre of province 3,Shrestha B.; Neupane A.; Pant S.; Shrestha A.; Bastola A.; Rajbhandari B.; Thapa A.; Singh A. ,"Background Nearly after 6 months of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 19, along with the world Nepal is still trying to control the spread and prevent general population from acquiring it. With limited resources in manpower, technology and evidence it has been a difficult battle. But with time and more understanding of the virus new technology to detect the virus are coming up. It is a major breakthrough in the diagnostic field as this helps us in not only detecting the virus but also helps us to mobilize our human resources. This comes in a time where the cases are increasing at an alarming rate. Although numbers of Polymerase Chain Reaction testing have increased but due to the time consuming and the cost wise, we need a faster and equally reliable alternative. Antigen test approved by different countries can be used for point of care, screening and surveillance depending upon the requirements after calculating its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Objective To find out sensitivity and specificity of the Antigen test kit for COVID-19. Method Antigen tests were compared with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction as a reference standard in calculated sample size of 113 subjects in a high risk population. Both Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and antigen test were performed in a same subject with in maximum of 2 days' interval. Convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. Ethical approval was taken from Nepal Health Research Council before data collection. Study was done from August to September 2020 from Quarantine center of Province 3. Result There were total of 113 test carried out, among those 47 were positive and 66 were negative in Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. After preparing two by two table, Sensitivity and specificity of the tested was calculated which came out to be 85% and 100% respectively, with accuracy of 93.80%. Conclusion Even though the sensitivity and specificity came to be higher, this test should be interpreted cautiously depending upon the prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 19 in that particular community and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested. When in doubt by clinical correlation should be confirmed with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.Copyright © 2020, Kathmandu University.

Serological Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus by Commercially Available Point-of-Care and Laboratory Diagnostics in Pre-COVID-19 Samples in Japan.,"Lyu, Zhaoqing; Harada Sassa, Mariko; Fujitani, Tomoko; Harada, Kouji H","The number of COVID-19 patients in Japan is considered low, compared with U.S. and European countries. However, recent serological survey reported that several percent of population showed IgG positive to SARS-CoV-2. Specificity in the assays might influence the estimate, and possibility of overdiagnosis should be investigated. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were performed in pre-COVID-19 sera in Japan (400 healthy subjects in 2012-2015). Lateral flow assay (LFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed 1.5% (6/400) and 1.75% (7/400) IgG positives, respectively. Among those false positive samples, only one sample was positive in both LFA and ELISA (0.25%; 95% CI: 0.006-1.39%). Possible bias from pooling method was examined by Monte Carlo method and the possibility was unlikely at low false positive rate. Previous surveys might overestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in several populations of Japan. These false positives could be excluded by combination of different diagnostics.

Here, we generate a pan-human coronavirus programmable phage display assay to perform proteome-wide profiling of coronavirus antigens enriched by 98 COVID-19 patient sera. Next, we employ ReScan, a method to efficiently sequester phage expressing the most immunogenic peptides and print them onto paper-based microarrays using acoustic liquid handling, which isolates and identifies 9 candidate antigens, 8 of which are derived from the 2 proteins used for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. After deployment in a high-throughput assay amenable to clinical lab settings, these antigens show improved specificity over a whole protein panel. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that ReScan will have broad applicability for other emerging infectious diseases or autoimmune diseases that lack a valid biomarker, enabling a seamless pipeline from antigen discovery to diagnostic using one recombinant protein source.

Reliability of serological tests for COVID-19: comparison of three immunochromatography test kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.,"Fujigaki, Hidetsugu; Takemura, Masao; Osawa, Michiko; Sakurai, Aki; Nakamoto, Kentaro; Seto, Koichi; Fujita, Takashi; Hata, Tadayoshi; Akiyama, Hidehiko; Doi, Yohei; Saito, Kuniaki","Background: Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear., Methods: Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 100 serum samples collected from 100 healthy volunteers in 2017 as negative controls., Results: The specificity of the IgM and IgG antibodies showed comparable results among the three immunochromatographic serological test kits. The specificity for IgM antibody was 98.0%, 98.0%, and 97.0%, and the specificity for IgG antibody was identical among the three kits (99.0%). The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0-4 days after onset) were consistent with all three kits (18.2%); however, the IgM antibody-positive rates thereafter showed considerable differences among the kits, making it difficult to interpret the kinetics of IgM response against SARS-CoV-2. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively., Conclusion: There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM, suggesting that at least 2 of these kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.

COVID-19 and immunological dysregulation: can autoantibodies be useful?,Pascolini S.; Vannini A.; Deleonardi G.; Ciordinik M.; Sensoli A.; Carletti I.; Veronesi L.; Ricci C.; Pronesti A.; Mazzanti L.; Grondona A.; Silvestri T.; Zanuso S.; Mazzolini M.; Lalanne C.; Quarneti C.; Fusconi M.; Giostra F.; Granito A.; Muratori L.; Lenzi M.; Muratori P. ,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often associated with interstitial pneumonia. However, there is insufficient knowledge on the presence of autoimmune serological markers in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed the presence and role of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia. We prospectively studied 33 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 31 (94%) of whom had interstitial pneumonia, and 25 age- and sex-matched patients with fever and/or pneumonia with etiologies other than COVID-19 as the pathological control group. All patients were tested for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs), and anti-cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCAs). Clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters were also collected. Fifteen of 33 (45%) patients tested positive for at least one autoantibody, including 11 who tested positive for ANAs (33%), 8 who tested positive for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (24%), and 3 who tested positive for anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (9%). ANCA reactivity was not detected in any patient. Patients that tested positive for autoantibodies had a significantly more severe prognosis than other patients did: 6 of 15 (40%) patients with autoantibodies died due to COVID-19 complications during hospitalization, whereas only 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients who did not have autoantibodies died (p = 0.03). Patients with poor prognosis (death due to COVID-19 complications) had a significantly higher respiratory rate at admission (23 breaths per minute vs. 17 breaths per minute; p = 0.03) and a higher frequency of autoantibodies (86% vs. 27%; p = 0.008). In conclusion, autoantibodies are frequently detected in patients with COVID-19 possibly reflecting a pathogenetic role of immune dysregulation. However, given the small number of patients, the association of autoantibodies with an unfavorable prognosis requires further multicenter studies.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to characterise the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2., Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and epidemiological records of patients hospitalised in a coronavirus field hospital in Wuhan. We performed qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) using archived blood samples., Results: Of 214 patients with SARS-CoV-2, 26 (12%) were asymptomatic at hospital admission and during hospitalisation. Most asymptomatic patients were <= 60 years (96%) and females (65%) and had few comorbidities (< 16%). Serum levels of white and red blood cells were higher in asymptomatic than in symptomatic patients (P-values < 0.05). During hospitalisation, IgG seroconversion was commonly observed in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (85% versus 94%, P-value = 0.07); in contrast, IgM seroconversion was less common in asymptomatic than in symptomatic patients (31% versus 74%, P-value < 0.001). The median time from the first virus-positive screening to IgG or IgM seroconversion was significantly shorter in asymptomatic than in symptomatic patients (median: 7 versus 14 days, P-value < 0.01). Furthermore, IgG/IgM seroconversion rates increased concomitantly with the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. At the time of virus clearance, IgG/IgM titres and plasma neutralisation capacity were significantly lower in recovered asymptomatic than in recovered symptomatic patients (P-values < 0.01)., Conclusion: Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients exhibited different kinetics of IgG/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2.

Method(s): All HCWs in Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital with either positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or positive antibody test before 18 April 2020 were included. Exposure, epidemiological and demographic information were retrospectively collected by a structured questionnaire. Medical records were also reviewed for clinical characteristics and CT images of HCWs. Result(s): As of 18 April 2020, a total of 424 HCWs were identified. Among them, 276 (65.1%) were symptomatic and 148 (34.9%) were asymptomatic. Fifty-five (19.9%) families of the symptomatic HCWs and 16 (10.8%) families of the asymptomatic HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2. HCWs with infected family members tended to be symptomatic (OR 2.053, 95% CI 1.130-3.730; p 0.018). Multivariable logistic regression analysis exhibited that performing tracheal intubation or extubation (OR 4.057, 95% CI 1.183-13.909; p 0.026) was associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas consistent use of N95 respirators (OR 0.369, 95% CI 0.201-0.680; p 0.001) and eye protection (OR 0.217, 95% CI 0.116-0.404; p < 0.001) were associated with an increased likelihood of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion(s): Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs comprised a considerable proportion of HCW infections during the pandemic of COVID-19.

Although anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response is usually detectable within three weeks after infection, limited information on the seroconversion rate of patients with cancer infected by SARS-CoV-2 is available. Method(s): This is a multicenter, observational, prospective study that included patients and oncology healthcare workers (HCWs) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR or clinical/radiological suspicious of infection as well as patients with cancer who are considered at high risk for infection. All subjects were tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassett for the fast detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of the study was to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rates by qualitative assay in patients with cancer and HCWs with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. Result(s): At first interim analysis, 166 subjects were enrolled in the study. Cancer patients and HCWs were 61 (36.7%) and 105 (63.3%), respectively. HCWs were younger than patients with cancer (median age 41 vs 62 years; P<0.001). Eighty-six subjects (51.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, while forty-nine (29.5%) had a clinical suspicious of COVID-19 in absence of RT-PCR confirmation. In patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 62 (83.8%) were IgG-positive. Neither differences in terms of IgG positivity (87.9% vs 80.5%; P=0.39) nor in median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to IgG detection (23.0 vs 28.0 days; P=0.21) were found between patients with cancer and HCWs. Conclusion(s): Our data show that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody response is not different between cancer patients and healthy subjects. Qualitative rapid test for antibody detection represents an useful support to RNA RT-PCR testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-risk populations, including patients with cancer.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Australian educational settings: a prospective cohort study.,"Macartney, Kristine; Quinn, Helen E; Pillsbury, Alexis J; Koirala, Archana; Deng, Lucy; Winkler, Noni; Katelaris, Anthea L; O'Sullivan, Matthew V N; Dalton, Craig; Wood, Nicholas; NSW COVID-19 Schools Study Team","BACKGROUND: School closures have occurred globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, empiric data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and in educational settings are scarce. In Australia, most schools have remained open during the first epidemic wave, albeit with reduced student physical attendance at the epidemic peak. We examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff in schools and early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW)., METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed paediatric (aged <=18 years) and adult COVID-19 cases who attended a school or ECEC setting while considered infectious (defined as 24 h before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period) in NSW from Jan 25 to April 10, 2020, were investigated for onward transmission. All identified school and ECEC settings close contacts were required to home quarantine for 14 days, and were monitored and offered SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing if symptomatic. Enhanced investigations in selected educational settings included nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts. Secondary attack rates were calculated and compared with state-wide COVID-19 rates., FINDINGS: 15 schools and ten ECEC settings had children (n=12) or adults (n=15) attend while infectious, with 1448 contacts monitored. Of these, 633 (43.7%) of 1448 had nucleic acid testing, or antibody testing, or both, with 18 secondary cases identified (attack rate 1.2%). Five secondary cases (three children; two adults) were identified (attack rate 0.5%; 5/914) in three schools. No secondary transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts. However, one outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children (attack rate 35.1%; 13/37). Across all settings, five (28.0%) of 18 secondary infections were asymptomatic (three infants [all aged 1 year], one adolescent [age 15 years], and one adult)., INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, consistent with mild infrequent disease in the 1.8 million child population. With effective case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID-19 transmission via attendance in educational settings. These findings could be used to inform modelling and public health policy regarding school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic., FUNDING: NSW Government Department of Health.

Prevalence and severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Transfusion Dependent and Non-Transfusion Dependent beta-thalassemia patients and effects of associated comorbidities: an Iranian nationwide study.,"Karimi, Mehran; Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Zarei, Tahereh; Azarkeivan, Azita; Shirkavand, Afshan; Matin, Sara; Tavakoli, Maryam Akavan; Zahedi, Zohre; De Sanctis, Vincenzo","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global and challenging disease that is accompany with mortality and morbidity., AIM OF STUDY: We evaluated the prevalence and the impact of comorbidities in thalassemia Iranian patients affected by COVID-19. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted across all comprehensive thalassemia centers in Iran, from January to June 15th, 2020., RESULTS: Forty-three confirmed COVID-19 thalassemia patients (32 TDT, and 11 NTDT) were detected. The mean age of patients was 35.3 +/- 11.5 years (range 9 - 67); 21 females and 22 males. Overall, 78.1% of TDT and 90.9% of NTDT patients were complicated with at least one comorbidity (P: 0.656). The overall mortality rate of thalassemia patients with COVID-19 was 18.6% while 27.3% was in NTDT patients compared to 15.6% in TDT patients (P:0.401). The dead group had a non-significant higher frequency of endocrinopathies compared to the recovered group (62.5% versus 45.7% P:0.457). Ten female thalassemia patients with positive COVID-19 had hypogonadism, six patients were receiving hormone replacement therapy and all of them recovered (zero death) compared to two deaths from 4 patients who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy (P:0.133). Furthermore, the prevalence of COVID-19 in NTDT patients was significantly higher than the general population (45 per 10,000 versus 22.29 per 10,000 respectively, P:0.018) while the prevalence of TDT was almost similar to the normal population (P:0.539). The mortality rate of COVID-19 was 4.71% in the normal Iranian population compared to 18.6% in beta-thalassemias (P: <0.001) at the same date., CONCLUSIONS: It is important to acknowledge that beta-thalassemia patients, especially young adults/adults, have a chronic condition which may contribute to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A higher susceptibility to the infection was observed in patients with NTDT and in untreated hypogonadal female thalassemic patients.

However, cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases, encompassing a spectrum of tumour subtypes. The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19 risk according to tumour subtype and patient demographics in patients with cancer in the UK. Method(s): We compared adult patients with cancer enrolled in the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) cohort between March 18 and May 8, 2020, with a parallel non-COVID-19 UK cancer control population from the UK Office for National Statistics (2017 data). The primary outcome of the study was the effect of primary tumour subtype, age, and sex and on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence and the case-fatality rate during hospital admission. We analysed the effect of tumour subtype and patient demographics (age and sex) on prevalence and mortality from COVID-19 using univariable and multivariable models. Finding(s): 319 (30.6%) of 1044 patients in the UKCCMP cohort died, 295 (92.5%) of whom had a cause of death recorded as due to COVID-19. The all-cause case-fatality rate in patients with cancer after SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with increasing age, rising from 0.10 in patients aged 40-49 years to 0.48 in those aged 80 years and older. Patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemia, lymphoma, and myeloma) had a more severe COVID-19 trajectory compared with patients with solid organ tumours (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.15-2.15; p<0.0043). Compared with the rest of the UKCCMP cohort, patients with leukaemia showed a significantly increased case-fatality rate (2.25, 1.13-4.57; p=0.023). After correction for age and sex, patients with haematological malignancies who had recent chemotherapy had an increased risk of death during COVID-19-associated hospital admission (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.09-4.08; p=0.028). Interpretation(s): Patients with cancer with different tumour types have differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 phenotypes. We generated individualised risk tables for patients with cancer, considering age, sex, and tumour subtype. Our results could be useful to assist physicians in informed risk-benefit discussions to explain COVID-19 risk and enable an evidenced-based approach to national social isolation policies.

The patient group (PG) comprised of hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 cases. Asymptomatic healthcare volunteers with negative rRT-PCR were included in the control group (CG). Measurement of IgM and IgG was obtained by dry fluorescence immunoassay., RESULTS: Twenty-six PG (65.9+/-15.4 years old, male 57.7%) and 18 CG (45.6+/-10.1 years old, male 33.3%) were included. By manufacturer's cut-off (>=0.04 mIU/ml), sensitivity and specificity were 73.08% and 88.89% for IgM and 88.46% and 33.33% for IgG, respectively. Estimated areas under the ROC curve were 0.907 and 0.848 for IgM and IgG, respectively. Results were improved using a cut-off of IgM >=0.05 mIU/ml and IgG >=0.10 mIU/ml., CONCLUSION: Using stringent cut-off values, SARS-CoV-2 antibody POCT detects immune people and can be used during socioeconomic normalization of communities.

Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2: Let's Stick to Known Knowns,Baumgarth N.; Nikolich-Zugich J.; Lee F.E.-H.; Bhattacharya D. ,"The scale of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has thrust immunology into the public spotlight in unprecedented ways. In this article, which is part opinion piece and part review, we argue that the normal cadence by which we discuss science with our colleagues failed to properly convey likelihoods of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 to the public and the media. As a result, biologically implausible outcomes were given equal weight as the principles set by decades of viral immunology. Unsurprisingly, questionable results and alarmist news media articles have filled the void. We suggest an emphasis on setting expectations based on prior findings while avoiding the overused approach of assuming nothing. After reviewing Ab-mediated immunity after coronavirus and other acute viral infections, we posit that, with few exceptions, the development of protective humoral immunity of more than a year is the norm.

Clinical and laboratory evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow assays for use in a national COVID-19 seroprevalence survey,Flower B.; Brown J.C.; Simmons B.; Moshe M.; Frise R.; Penn R.; Kugathasan R.; Petersen C.; Daunt A.; Ashby D.; Riley S.; Atchison C.J.; Taylor G.P.; Satkunarajah S.; Naar L.; Klaber R.; Badhan A.; Rosadas C.; Khan M.; Fernandez N.; Sureda-Vives M.; Cheeseman H.M.; O'Hara J.; Fontana G.; Pallett S.J.C.; Rayment M.; Jones R.; Moore L.S.P.; McClure M.O.; Cherepanov P.; Tedder R.; Ashrafian H.; Shattock R.; Ward H.; Darzi A.; Elliot P.; Barclay W.S.; Cooke G.S. ,"BACKGROUND: Accurate antibody tests are essential to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can deliver testing at scale. However, reported performance varies, and sensitivity analyses have generally been conducted on serum from hospitalised patients. For use in community testing, evaluation of finger-prick self-tests, in non-hospitalised individuals, is required. METHOD(S): Sensitivity analysis was conducted on 276 non-hospitalised participants. All had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR and were >=21days from symptom onset. In phase I, we evaluated five LFIAs in clinic (with finger prick) and laboratory (with blood and sera) in comparison to (1) PCR-confirmed infection and (2) presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on two 'in-house' ELISAs. Specificity analysis was performed on 500 prepandemic sera. In phase II, six additional LFIAs were assessed with serum. FINDINGS: 95% (95% CI 92.2% to 97.3%) of the infected cohort had detectable antibodies on at least one ELISA. LFIA sensitivity was variable, but significantly inferior to ELISA in 8 out of 11 assessed. Of LFIAs assessed in both clinic and laboratory, finger-prick self-test sensitivity varied from 21% to 92% versus PCR-confirmed cases and from 22% to 96% versus composite ELISA positives. Concordance between finger-prick and serum testing was at best moderate (kappa 0.56) and, at worst, slight (kappa 0.13). All LFIAs had high specificity (97.2%-99.8%). INTERPRETATION: LFIA sensitivity and sample concordance is variable, highlighting the importance of evaluations in setting of intended use. This rigorous approach to LFIA evaluation identified a test with high specificity (98.6% (95%CI 97.1% to 99.4%)), moderate sensitivity (84.4% with finger prick (95%CI 70.5% to 93.5%)) and moderate concordance, suitable for seroprevalence surveys.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Early diagnosis and population prevention of coronavirus disease 2019.,"Su, Ying-Ying; Zhang, Shi-Yin; Li, Ting-Dong; Xia, Ning-Shao","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by nucleic acid and antibody testing as well as its contribution to mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019., RECENT FINDINGS: Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is the firstly developed and most widely used diagnostic technique for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAT assays is always unsatisfactory, mainly due to insufficient viral RNA in samples, especially when upper respiratory samples were used. Compared with NAT assays, serological tests are more convenient and less dependent on the quality of sample collection. But the sensitivity of antibody assays varies largely to test samples collected at different time after onset of symptoms. The diagnostic sensitivity can be significantly improved by combination of RNA and antibody testing. Due to the lack of effective drugs and vaccines, population prevention results mainly from timely triage and quarantine of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Thus, extensive testing with NAT and antibody assays simultaneously is very important to constrain coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic., SUMMARY: Viral RNA testing combining with serological testing could improve the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has great value for clinical practice and public health.",2020,/,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,,101264945,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/COH.0000000000000649,32969974,#36305,Su 2020,Exclusion reason: No seroprevalence estimate; ,""

SARS-CoV-2 identification and IgA antibodies in saliva: one sample two tests approach for diagnosis.,"Aita, Ada; Basso, Daniela; Maria Cattelan, Anna; Fioretto, Paola; Navaglia, Filippo; Barbaro, Francesco; Stoppa, Alice; Coccorullo, Enrico; Farella, Assunta; Socal, Aurora; Vettor, Roberto; Plebani, Mario","AIM: This study aims to verify whether standardized saliva collection is suitable for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection and IgA measurement., METHODS: 43 COVID-19 inpatients and 326 screening subjects underwent naso-pharyngeal (NP)-swab and saliva collection (Salivette). Inpatients also underwent repeated blood collections to evaluate inflammation and organs involvement. In all patients and subjects, SARS-CoV-2 (gene E) rRT-PCR was undertaken in saliva and NP-swabs. Salivary IgA and serum IgA, IgG, IgM were measured on inpatients' samples., RESULTS: NP-swabs and saliva were both SARS-CoV-2 positive in 7 (16%) or both negative in 35 (82%) out of 43 patients successfully included in the study. NP-swabs and saliva results did not perfectly match in one patient (saliva positive, NP-swab negative). Positive molecular results were significantly associated with disease duration (p=0.0049). 326/326 screening subjects were SARS-CoV-2 negative on both NP-swabs and saliva. Among the 27 saliva samples tested for IgA, 18 were IgA positive. Salivary IgA positivity was associated with pneumonia (p=0.002) and CRP values (p=0.0183), not with other clinical and molecular data, or with serum immunoglubulins., CONCLUSIONS: A standardized saliva collection can be adopted to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in alternative to NP-swabs.

Incarcerated and detained populations have a high prevalence of chronic diseases, increasing their risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and making early detection critical (2,3). Correctional and detention facilities are not closed systems; SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted to and from the surrounding community through staff member and visitor movements as well as entry, transfer, and release of incarcerated and detained persons (1). To better understand SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in these settings, CDC requested data from 15 jurisdictions describing results of mass testing events among incarcerated and detained persons and cases identified through earlier symptom-based testing. Six jurisdictions reported SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 0%-86.8% (median = 29.3%) from mass testing events in 16 adult facilities. Before mass testing, 15 of the 16 facilities had identified at least one COVID-19 case among incarcerated or detained persons using symptom-based testing, and mass testing increased the total number of known cases from 642 to 8,239. Case surveillance from symptom-based testing has likely underestimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities. Broad-based testing can provide a more accurate assessment of prevalence and generate data to help control transmission (4).",2020,/,MMWR.

Searches in eight bibliographic databases were performed to systematically review the evidence on the prevalence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCW. Ninety-seven studies (All published in 2020), including 230,398 HCW, met the inclusion criteria. From the screened HCW using RT-PCR and the presence of antibodies, the estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11% (95%CI; 7%-15%) and 7% (95% CI; 4%-11%), respectively. The most frequently affected personnel were the nurses (48%. 95%CI; 41%-56%), while most of the COVID-19 positive medical personnel were working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards during the screening (43%, 95%CI;28%-59%). Anosmia, fever and myalgia were identified as the only symptoms associated with HCW SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among RT-PCR positive HCW, 40% (95%CI;17%-65%) did not show symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Finally, 5% (95%CI;3%-8%) of the COVID-19 positive HCW developed severe clinical complications, and 0.5% (95% CI; 0.02%-1.3%) died. HCW suffer a significant burden from COVID-19, with HCW working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards and nurses being the most infected personnel.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Community-Level Factors Associated With Racial And Ethnic Disparities In COVID-19 Rates In Massachusetts,Figueroa J.F.; Wadhera R.K.; Lee D.; Yeh R.W.; Sommers B.D. ,"Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities of COVID-19 is critical to inform public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts towns/cities (01/01/2020-05/06/2020) and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population was associated with a 312.3 increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born non-citizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted, and may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign born non-citizens, address crowded housing, and protect food-service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities.

We describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and associated symptoms and review shelter infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. METHOD(S): PEH and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during April 7-May 6, 2020. A subset of PEH and staff was screened for symptoms. Shelter assessments were conducted concurrently at a convenience sample of shelters using a standardized questionnaire. RESULT(S): Overall, 2,875 individuals at 24 shelters and nine unsheltered outreach events underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 2,860 (99.5%) had conclusive test results. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 2.1% (36/1,684) among PEH living sheltered, 0.5% (3/628) among PEH living unsheltered, and 1.3% (7/548) among staff. Reporting fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the last week during symptom screening was 14% sensitive and 89% specific for identifying COVID-19 cases compared with RT-PCR. Prevalence by shelter ranged 0%-27.6%. Repeat testing 3-4 weeks later at four shelters documented decreased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (0%-3.9%). Nine of 24 shelters completed shelter assessments and implemented IPC measures as part of the COVID-19 response. CONCLUSION(S): PEH living in shelters experienced higher SARS-CoV-2 prevalence compared with PEH living unsheltered. Facility-wide testing in congregate settings allowed for identification and isolation of COVID-19 cases and is an important strategy to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Prevalence of COVID infections in a population of rheumatic patients from Lombardy and Marche treated with biological drugs or small molecules: A multicentre retrospective study,Piercarlo S.-P.; Daniela M.; Roberto C.; Carlo Maurizio M.; Ennio Giulio F.; Franco F.; Michela F.; Silvia B.; Chiara B.; Sara B.; Valeria G.; Alberto B.; Antonella C.; Patrizia B.; Lorenzo D.; Silvia S.; Viviana R.; Silvia T.; Sonia F.; Paola F.; Laura C.; Maria L.A.; Massimo G.; Fausto S. ,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the management of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for rheumatic conditions. It is well known that rheumatic patients are at risk of developing infections because of their immunocompromised state. Moreover, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab that are widely used to treat rheumatic diseases are now being used to treat COVID-19. The aim of this multicentre retrospective study of rheumatic patients in the Italian regions of Lombardy and Marche was to determine whether patients receiving biological or small molecules treatment are more susceptible to the development of COVID-19 than the general population. Method(s): The local registry data of 10,260 rheumatic patients being treated with bDMARDs or small molecules were evaluated from 15 March to 23 April 2020. The final analysis was based on the registry data relating to 7.204, telephone contacts and/or outpatient visits. Result(s): Forty-seven of the 7.204 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, seven of whom died; the patients who had symptoms resembling those of COVID-19 but had negative swabs were considered negative for the disease. The overall infection rate was 0.65, and the crude case fatality risk (CFR) in the patients with COVID-19 was 14.9%. There was no difference in the mortality rate among the patients receiving the different individual biological drugs or small molecules. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that the susceptibility of rheumatic patients to COVID-19 is the same as that of the general population, but confirm that age, disease duration, and the number of co-morbidities are associated with an increased risk of a severe form of the disease. It seems that immunosuppressants drugs do not effectively represent a risk factor for COVID- 19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,/,Journal of Autoimmunity,,"(Piercarlo, Daniela, Sara, Valeria) Rheumatology Unit, ASST-Fatebenefratelli L.

OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate SARS-CoV-2 case counts across several adult and family homeless shelters in a major metropolitan area. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based surveillance study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917). SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms. INTERVENTION: Two strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing (""surge testing"") events. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity. RESULT(S): Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room. LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count. CONCLUSION(S): Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters.

COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a National Healthcare System: the Qatar Experience,Alajmi J.; Jeremijenko A.M.; Abraham J.C.; Alishaq M.; Concepcion E.G.; Butt A.A.; Abou-Samra A.-B. ,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection. METHOD(S): The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10-June 24, 2020. Data on COVID-19+ HCW were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. RESULT(S): Among 16,912 HCW tested, 10.6% tested positive. Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. In a follow-up survey of 393 HCW, 5% reported acquiring infection at a COVID-19-designated facility and 95% at a non-COVID-19 facility having acquired the infection through accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or a patient (29%). Full PPE adherence was 82% at COVID-19-designated but only 68% at non-COVID-19 facilities. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 infection among HCW often occurs among those not directly working with COVID-19 patients. PPE use is less stringent in such settings. Risk of exposure and need for strict PPE must be stressed upon all HCW in all settings.Copyright © 2020.

Prevalence of suspected COVID-19 infection in patients from ethnic minority populations: a cross-sectional study in primary care,Hull S.A.; Williams C.; Ashworth M.; Carvalho C.; Boomla K. ,"BACKGROUND: The first wave of the London COVID-19 epidemic peaked in April 2020. Attention initially focused on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. While general practice has seen a rapid uptake of technology to allow for virtual consultations, little is known about the pattern of suspected COVID-19 presentations in primary care. AIM: To quantify the prevalence and time course of clinically suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices, to report the risk of suspected COVID-19 by ethnic group, and to identify whether differences by ethnicity can be explained by clinical data in the GP record. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of approximately 1.2 million adults registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups. The study population includes 55% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. METHOD(S): Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified clinically and recorded using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included data on 16 long-term conditions, body mass index, and smoking status. RESULT(S): GPs recorded 8985 suspected COVID-19 cases between 10 February and 30 April 2020.Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in the odds of suspected COVID-19 for South Asian and black adults compared with white adults. In a fully adjusted analysis that included clinical factors, South Asian patients had nearly twice the odds of suspected infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83 to 2.04). The OR for black patients was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.38 to 1.57). CONCLUSION(S): Using data from GP records, black and South Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of suspected COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission reports. Further understanding of these differences requires social and occupational data.Copyright ©The Authors.",2020,/,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,,"(Hull, Williams, Boomla) Centre for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Data Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, London(Ashworth) Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London, London(Carvalho) De Beauvoir Surgery, Lond",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3399/bjgp20X712601,632815279,#33488,Hull 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Patients With Cancer Treated at a Tertiary Care Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic,Berghoff A.S.; Gansterer M.; Bathke A.C.; Trutschnig W.; Hungerlander P.; Berger J.M.; Kreminger J.; Starzer A.M.; Strassl R.; Schmidt R.; Willschke H.; Lamm W.; Raderer M.; Gottlieb A.D.; Mauser N.J.; Preusser M. ,"PURPOSE: To analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer in hospital care after implementation of institutional and governmental safety measurements. METHOD(S): Patients with cancer routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction between March 21 and May 4, 2020, were included. The results of this cancer cohort were statistically compared with the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Austrian population as determined by a representative nationwide random sample study (control cohort 1) and a cohort of patients without cancer presenting to our hospital (control cohort 2). RESULT(S): A total of 1,688 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1,016 consecutive patients with cancer were performed. A total of 270 of 1,016 (26.6%) of the patients were undergoing active anticancer treatment in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant and 560 of 1,016 (55.1%) in a palliative setting. A total of 53 of 1,016 (5.2%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19. In 4 of 1,016 (0.4%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected. At the time of testing at our department, all four SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were asymptomatic, and two of them had recovered from symptomatic COVID-19. Viral clearance was achieved in three of the four patients 14-56 days after testing positive. The estimated odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between the cancer cohort and control cohort 1 was 1.013 (95% CI, 0.209 to 4.272; P = 1), and between control cohort 2 and the cancer cohort it was 18.333 (95% CI, 6.056 to 74.157). CONCLUSION(S): Our data indicate that continuation of active anticancer therapy and follow-up visits in a large tertiary care hospital are feasible and safe after implementation of strict population-wide and institutional safety measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Homeless Shelter Characteristics and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2.,"Karb, Rebecca; Samuels, Elizabeth; Vanjani, Rahul; Trimbur, Catherine; Napoli, Anthony","INTRODUCTION: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators., RESULTS: A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.",2020,/,The western journal of emergency medicine,21,5,1048-1053,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.7.48725,32970553,#37366,Karb 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections at a testing site in Berlin, Germany, March and April 2020 - A cross-sectional study",Maechler F.; Gertler M.; Hermes J.; van Loon W.; Schwab F.; Piening B.; Rojansky S.; Hommes F.; Kausch F.; Lindner A.K.; Burock S.; Rossig H.; Hartmann C.; Kirchberger V.; Thieme A.; Behnke M.; Gastmeier P.; Mockenhaupt F.P.; Seybold J. ,"OBJECTIVE: In Berlin, the first public SARS-CoV-2 testing site started one day after the first case in the city occured. We describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics and aim at identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the first six weeks of operation. METHOD(S): Testing followed national recommendations, but was also based on the physician's discretion. We related patient characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for exploratory analyses using a cross-sectional, observational study design. RESULT(S): Between March 3 and April 13, 2020, 5179 patients attended the site (median age 34 years; IQR 26-47 years). The median time since disease onset was 4 days (IQR 2-7 days). Among 4333 patients tested, 333 (7.7%) were positive. Test positivity increased up to 10.3% (96/929) during the first three weeks and then declined, paralleling Germany's lock-down and the course of the epidemic in Berlin. Strict adherence to testing guidelines resulted in 10.4% (262/2530) test positivity, compared to 3.9% (71/1803) among patients tested for other indications. A nightclub was a transmission hotspot; 27.7% (26/94) of one night's visitors were found positive. Smell and/or taste dysfunction indicated COVID-19 with 85.6% specificity (95%CI 82.1-88.1%). Some 4% (14/333) of those infected were asymptomatic. Risk factors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recent contact to a positive case (second week after contact, OR 3.42; 95%CI 2.48-4.71), travel to regions of high pandemic activity (e.g. Austria, OR 4.16; 95%CI 2.48-6.99), recent onset of symptoms (second week, OR 3.61; 95%CI 1.87-6.98), and an impaired sense of smell/taste (4.08; 95%CI 2.36-7.03). CONCLUSION(S): In this young population, early-onset presentation of COVID-19 resembled flu-like symptoms, except for smell and/or taste dysfunction. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 detection were return from regions with high incidence and contact to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, particularly when tests were administered within the first two weeks after contact and/or onset of symptoms.Copyright © 2020.

Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; P = .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody >=160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for CCP collection (<=28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer., CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Routine blood tests as an active surveillance to monitor COVID-19 prevalence. A retrospective study.,"Ferrari, Davide; Cabitza, Federico; Carobene, Anna; Locatelli, Massimo","BACKGROUND: In Italy, one of the country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first autochthonous case appeared in Lombardy on February 20th, 2020. One month later, the number of -COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be -highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed., RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts., CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found.

COVID-19 in a state of Brazilian Northeast: prevalence and associated factors in people with flu-like syndrome,Garces T.S.; Florencio R.S.; Cestari V.R.F.; Pereira M.L.D.; Moreira T.M.M.; Bezerra Sousa G.J. ,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors to COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceara-Brazil. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ceara. The capital of the Ceara State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHOD(S): 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analyzed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases, and Down's syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULT(S): The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes. CONCLUSION(S): among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVD-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceara State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavorable prognosis of the disease.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

"SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in Norway: confirmed infection, hospitalisations and underlying conditions.","Stordal, Ketil; Bakken, Inger Johanne; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Klingenberg, Claus; Helland, Eyvind; Nystad, Wenche; Hjellvik, Vidar; Gulseth, Hanne Lovdal","BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents are at lower risk of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. We describe the incidence of confirmed infection and hospitalisation of children and adolescents under the age of 20 in Norway, and specifically among those with underlying conditions., MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Norwegian Directorate of Health has collaborated with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on the establishment of a data extraction system to monitor the coronavirus outbreak. Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR), and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) are linked to data on positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). This covers all persons living in Norway as of 1 March 2020, with data on confirmed infection up to and including 13 May 2020 and on hospitalisations up to and including 30 April 2020., RESULTS: Of 8 125 persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the whole population, 493 (6.1 %) were under 20 years old. The median age of the under-20s was 15 years, and 252 (51 %) were girls. 3 % were hospitalised. No deaths were registered among patients aged under 20 in Norway. We found a somewhat larger share with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the group with diseases of the neuromuscular system., INTERPRETATION: Few children and adolescents have had SARS-CoV-2 confirmed, and only a very few have been hospitalised.

The epidemiological, virological and serological features were analyzed based on the demographic data, temporal profile of nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 during the disease, and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG after recovery., RESULTS: From January 1 to April 16, 2020, 35 of 6001 PLWH have experienced COVID-19, with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 to be 0.58% (95%CI: 0.42%-0.81%). Among the COVID-19 cases, 15 (42.86%) had severe illness, with 2 deaths. The incidence, case-severity and case-fatality of COVID-19 in PLWH were comparable to that in the entire population in Wuhan. 197 persons had cART discontinuation, of whom 4 persons experienced COVID-19. Risk factors for COVID-19 were age >=50 years old and cART discontinuation. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding among confirmed COVID-19 cases in PLWH was 30 (IQR: 20-46) days. Cases with high HIV viral load (>=20 copies/ml) had lower IgM and IgG levels than those with low HIV viral load (<20 copies/ml) (median S/CO for IgM, 0.03 vs. 0.11, P<0.001; median S/CO for IgG, 10.16 vs. 17.04, P=0.069)., CONCLUSIONS: Efforts need to maintain the persistent supply of antiretroviral treatment to elderly PLWH aged 50 years or above during the COVID-19 epidemic. The coinfection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 might change the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in PLWH. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Usability and acceptability of home-based self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for population surveillance,Atchison C.; Pristera P.; Cooper E.; Papageorgiou V.; Redd R.; Piggin M.; Flower B.; Fontana G.; Satkunarajah S.; Ashrafian H.; Lawrence-Jones A.; Naar L.; Chigwende J.; Gibbard S.; Riley S.; Darzi A.; Elliott P.; Ashby D.; Barclay W.; Cooke G.S.; Ward H. ,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses acceptability and usability of home-based self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA). METHOD(S): We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULT(S): Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89). CONCLUSION(S): Impactful public involvement is feasible in a rapid response setting. Home self-testing with LFIAs can be used with a high degree of acceptability and usability by adults, making them a good option for use in seroprevalence surveys.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

In this study, we assessed the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults in Marion County, Indiana. Methods: Individuals living in Marion County with no symptoms of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) within seven days of enrollment were eligible for this cross-sectional household study. Study kits were delivered to the participant's residence for self-swabbing, picked up by the study team, and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SAR-CoV-2 infection. Results: Five hundred eleven nasal swabs were collected from 119 children and 392 adults >= 18 years of age. One participant (seven years of age) tested positive, for an overall study prevalence of 0.2% (95% CI 0, 0.6%). The participant had no known contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and five family members tested negative for infection. The child and family members all tested negative for infection 10 and 20 days after the first test, and none developed symptoms of COVID-19 for 20 days after testing.

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody detection for sero-epidemiology: a multiplex analysis approach accounting for accurate seroprevalence,den Hartog G.; Schepp R.M.; Kuijer M.; GeurtsvanKessel C.; van Beek J.; Rots N.; Koopmans M.P.G.; van der Klis F.R.M.; van Binnendijk R.S. ,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates a better understanding of the kinetics of antibody production induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to develop a high throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. METHOD(S): Spike protein subunits S1 and RBD, and Nucleoprotein were coupled to distinct microspheres. Sera collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (N=224), and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (N=184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=115) with various severity of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific concentrations of IgG. RESULT(S): Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay obtained a specificity between 95.1 and 99.0% with a sensitivity ranging from 83.6-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to non-hospitalized cases. CONCLUSION(S): The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. Finally, we demonstrated that testing of antibodies against different antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single antigen-specific IgG determination.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

"SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in a hospital in Madrid, Spain",Garcia I.S.; Lopez M.J.M.A.; Vicente A.S.; Abascal P.L. ,"AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) between February 24th to April 30th, 2020 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHOD(S): We designed a retrospective cohort study. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for all HCWs and categorized according to presumed level of COVID-19 exposure (high, medium and low). RESULT(S): Among 1,911 HCW, 213 (11.1%) had COVID-19 during the study period. Cases increased gradually from March 8th, peaking in March 17th and declining thereafter. The peak of cases among HCWs was reached 14 days before the peak in admitted COVID-19 cases in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (p=0.123). There were 5 departments and 2 professions in which more than 20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. We identified temporal clusters in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than 5 days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and 1 patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (IQR: 15 - 26) days. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that HCW-to-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave.Copyright © 2020 The Healthcare Infection Society.

aThe dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19,Zhou W.; Xu X.; Chang Z.; Wang H.; Zhong X.; Tong X.; Liu T.; Li Y. ,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic since it emerged in December, 2019. Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with the first 2-3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4-10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31/40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/ml, within 1-2 weeks in the second month and then sustained around 100 AU/ml until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid converted to negative (p=0.002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs. late recovery stage, n=16, p=0.003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7-77.0%). Our results suggested the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovery patients may have robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half arises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of humoral immune response in the future period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing vaccine.

Apparent and occult infections of medical staff in a COVID-19 designated hospital.,"Li, Guozhen; Hu, Caiying; He, Qiong; Liu, Jing; Xiong, Nian; Wang, Haizhou","Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19), numerous medical staff are fighting on the frontline. However, the possibility of occult infection in medical staff is ignored in many recent studies. Herein, we collected data in a COVID-19 designated hospital from January 22, 2020 to March 10, 2020. A total of 33 medical staff had at least one nucleic acid test of throat swab, immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM serum antibody test, and chest computed tomography (CT), were enrolled. Finally, we identified 25 cases (75.8%) were isolated for hospitalized treatment after positive virus detection. In addition, 4 cases who were all negative for nucleic acid test detection with no clinical symptoms, and none of their chest CT were abnormal. However, the results of serum IgG or IgM antibody test in these 4 cases were positive, suggesting the presence of occult infection. In conclusion, data from our single center indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a high medical infection rate (29/33 = 87.9%) and might have a potential risk of occult infection.

All infants of mothers with COVID-19 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing., SETTING: Three New York City hospitals POPULATION: Pregnant women > 20 weeks' gestation admitted for delivery METHODS: Data were stratified by SARS-CoV-2 result and symptomatic status, and summarized using parametric and nonparametric tests., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and outcomes of maternal COVID-19; obstetric outcomes; neonatal SARS-CoV-2; placental pathology., RESULTS: Of 675 women admitted for delivery, 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 78.6% were asymptomatic. We observed differences in sociodemographics and comorbidities between women with symptomatic vs. asymptomatic vs. no COVID-19. Cesarean delivery rates were 46.7% in symptomatic COVID-19, 45.5% in asymptomatic COVID-19, and 30.9% without COVID-19 (p=0.044). Postpartum complications (fever, hypoxia, readmission) occurred in 12.9% of women with COVID-19 vs 4.5% of women without COVID-19 (p<0.001). No woman required mechanical ventilation, and no maternal deaths occurred. Among 71 infants tested, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Placental pathology demonstrated increased frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion, indicative of thrombi in fetal vessels, in women with vs. without COVID-19 (48.3% vs 11.3%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Among pregnant women with COVID-19 at delivery, we observed increased cesarean delivery rates and increased frequency of maternal complications in the postpartum period. Additionally, intraplacental thrombi may have maternal and fetal implications for COVID-19 infections remote from delivery. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

In more than 80% of tested patients, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national survey was launched on March 30, 2020 by the French society of dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations., RESULTS: We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations (58.5% females, median age 25.7 years [range 18-39]). The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms, and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains (n= 26/29). Twelve patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Ten patients were positive among the 150 (48%) who were tested (RT-PCR and/or serology). Seven of 121 RT-PCR-tested patients were positive and 5 of 75 serology-tested patients were positive (IgG) among them RT-PCR and serology were both positive for two patients. Seven of 121 RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (6%), and 5 of 75 serology-tested patients had IgG anti- SARS-CoV-2 (7 %). Tested and untested patients or those with and without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral-lesion clinical characteristics., CONCLUSION: The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains but found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France.

IRRs were synthesised across countries using random effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13% (IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). Closure of public transport was not associated with any additional reduction in covid-19 incidence when the other four physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR with and without public transport closure was 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88; n=72, and 0.87, 0.84 to 0.91; n=32, respectively). Data from 11 countries also suggested similar overall effectiveness (pooled IRR 0.85, 0.81 to 0.89) when school closures, workplace closures, and restrictions on mass gatherings were in place. In terms of sequence of interventions, earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in covid-19 incidence (pooled IRR 0.86, 0.84 to 0.89; n=105) compared with a delayed implementation of lockdown after other physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94; n=41)., CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing interventions were associated with reductions in the incidence of covid-19 globally. No evidence was found of an additional effect of public transport closure when the other four physical distancing measures were in place. Earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in the incidence of covid-19. These findings might support policy decisions as countries prepare to impose or lift physical distancing measures in current or future epidemic waves.

SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in an asymptomatic cancer cohort - results and consequences for clinical routine.,"Marschner, Sebastian; Corradini, Stefanie; Rauch, Josefine; Zacharias, Richard; Sujic, Ana; Mayerle, Julia; Petru, Raluca; Grabein, Beatrice; Keppler, Oliver T; Boelke, Edwin; Belka, Claus; Niyazi, Maximilian","BACKGROUND: Starting in December 2019, the current pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confronts the world with an unprecedented challenge. With no vaccine or drug being currently available to control the pandemic spread, prevention and PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) testing becomes a crucial pillar of medical systems. Aim of the present study was to report on the first results of the measures taken in a large German Department of Radiation Oncology, including PCR testing of asymptomatic cancer patients., METHODS: Pandemic-adapted hygiene regulations and prevention measures for patients and staff were implemented. A visiting ban on both wards was implemented from the beginning and medical staff and patients were required to wear face masks at all times. The waiting rooms were rearranged to ensure distance between patients of at least 1.5 m. Clinical follow up was mainly done by telephone and all patients had to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms and contacts with COVID-19 patients before entering our department. Educational documents were created for patients to raise awareness of symptoms and avoidance strategies for interactions with other people. Indications for therapy and fractionation schemes were adapted when possible. In a subsequent step, all new asymptomatic patients were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at our screening station shortly before their simulation CT., RESULTS: All these measures and implementations have been well accepted semiquantitatively measured by the consent received from patients and staff. Regarding the PCR testing, only 1 out of 139 asymptomatic patients of our cohort so far tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, reflecting a prevalence of 0.72% in this cancer patient population. Up to this point no staff members was tested positive. The start of the treatment for the PCR-positive patient was deferred for 2 weeks., CONCLUSION: Due to the pandemic-adapted implementations, our department seems well prepared during this crisis. The initial screening helps to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in order to protect other patients and our staff from infection and the observed PCR prevalence is in line with comparable studies. A regular PCR testing (e.g. twice a week) of all patients and staff would in principle be desirable but is limited due to testing capacities at present.",2020,/,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",15,1,165,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13014-020-01609-0,32646505,#14082,Marschner 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants.

COVID-19 in Children: An Ample Review.,"Ciuca, Ioana M","The aim of this review was to describe the current knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) in children, from epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory perspectives, including knowledge on the disease course, treatment, and prognosis. An extensive literature search was performed to identify papers on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) in children, published between January 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. There were 44 relevant papers on COVID-19 in children. The results showed that COVID-19 occurs in 0.39-12.3% of children. Clinical signs and symptoms are comparable to those in adults, but milder forms and a large percentage of asymptomatic carriers are found among children. Elevated inflammatory markers are associated with complications and linked to various co-infections. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans in children revealed structural changes similar to those found in adults, with consolidations surrounded by halos being somewhat specific for children with COVID-19. The recommended treatment includes providing symptomatic therapy, with no specific drug recommendations for children. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults. This review highlights that COVID-19 in children is similar to the disease in the adult population, but with particularities regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, chest imaging, and treatment. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults, but with the progression of the pandemic; the cases in children might change in the future.

Short-term applications include rapid case identification and contact tracing to limit viral spread, while population screening to determine the extent of viral infection across communities is a longer-term need. Assays developed to address these needs should match the ASSURED criteria. We have identified agglutination tests based on the commonly employed blood typing methods as a viable option. These blood typing tests are employed in hospitals worldwide, are high-throughput, fast (10-30 min), and automated in most cases. Herein, we describe the application of agglutination assays to SARS-CoV-2 serology testing by combining column agglutination testing with peptide-antibody bioconjugates, which facilitate red cell cross-linking only in the presence of plasma containing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

On March 29, 2020, a staff member in a correctional and detention facility in Louisiana developed symptoms  and later had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. During April 2-May 7, two additional cases were detected among staff members, and 36 cases were detected among incarcerated and detained persons at the facility; these persons were removed from dormitories and isolated, and the five dormitories that they had resided in before diagnosis were quarantined. On May 7, CDC and the Louisiana Department of Health initiated an investigation to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incarcerated and detained persons residing in quarantined dormitories. Goals of this investigation included evaluating COVID-19 symptoms in this setting and assessing the effectiveness of serial testing to identify additional persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of efforts to mitigate transmission. During May 7-21, testing of 98 incarcerated and detained persons residing in the five quarantined dormitories (A-E) identified an additional 71 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 32 (45%) were among persons who reported no symptoms at the time of testing, including three who were presymptomatic. Eighteen cases (25%) were identified in persons who had received negative test results during previous testing rounds. Serial testing of contacts from shared living quarters identified persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who would not have been detected by symptom screening alone or by testing at a single time point.

Although the cluster number (/107 subjects) in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly smaller compared to those in the other two groups, the cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly larger than that in non-medical/welfare facilities. Cluster numbers in general medical/welfare facilities and in non-medical/welfare facilities were significantly positively correlated with morbidity (/105 ), indicating relatively early identification of clusters in these facilities. Unlike in these facilities, cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly positively correlated with morbidity, indicating that clusters in LCT hospitals/facilities were finally identified after already having grown to a large size in areas where infection was prevalent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both cluster number and cluster size only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently associated with higher mortality (> median: 0.64/105 subjects) after adjustment., CONCLUSIONS: Preventive efforts against COVID-19 outbreaks even at the early phase of the epidemic are critically important in LTC hospitals/facilities, since both larger number and size of cluster only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently linked to higher mortality in prefectures in Japan. <248 words>.

Repeated point prevalence surveys (serial testing of all residents and health care personnel at a health care facility irrespective of symptoms) have been used to identify asymptomatic infections and have reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission during SNF outbreaks (1,3). During March 2020, the Detroit Health Department and area hospitals detected a sharp increase in COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and associated deaths among SNF residents. The Detroit Health Department collaborated with local government, academic, and health care system partners and a CDC field team to rapidly expand SARS-CoV-2 testing and implement infection prevention and control (IPC) activities in all Detroit-area SNFs. During March 7-May 8, among 2,773 residents of 26 Detroit SNFs, 1,207 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified during three periods: before (March 7-April 7) and after two point prevalence surveys (April 8-25 and April 30-May 8): the overall attack rate was 44%.

A subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for IgM antibodies by proteome array method., RESULTS: All specificity and cross-reactivity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0/795, 0%). Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression.

COVID-19 cluster study at a teaching hospital,von Freyburg A.; Hagedorn H.; Brucher B.; Schmidt A.; Scherer M.A.,"On Mar 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated in its Situation Report - 51 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. In early April 2020, a teaching hospital underwent shutdown and quarantine due to an outbreak of infection in accordance with Section 6 of the Infection Protection Act (index patient and 5 infected nursing staff). The complete staff (physicians, nurses and nonmedical personnel [NMP]) underwent COVID-19 testing within two phases: (1) between Apr 3rd and 5th, 2020 [n=1170], followed by (2) between Apr 8th and 9th, 2020 [n=953] with COVID-19 silent carrier positivity rates in accordance to testing phases of (1) n=19 (1.6%) and (2) n=25 (2.6%). The cumulative infection rate for NMP (1.6%), doctors (3.8%) and nurses (9.7%) was connected to type and extent of COVID-19 patient contact. Despite COVID-19 positivity of 34.8% (46 of 132 beds), a risk-free management of hospital operation is possible to a certain extent if hygiene regulations and strict patient selection are followed. However, a COVID-19-free clinic cannot be expected due to silent carriers.Copyright © 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2020,,MMW-Fortschr.

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): What do we know about children? A systematic review,Mehta N.S.; Mytton O.T.; Mullins E.W.S.; Fowler T.A.; Falconer C.L.; Murphy O.B.; Langenberg C.; Jayatunga W.J.P.; Eddy D.H.; Nguyen-Van-Tam J.S.,"BACKGROUND: Few paediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children, though more is known about other coronaviruses. We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes and transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2, in order to inform clinical and public health measures. METHOD(S): We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. RESULT(S): 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission. CONCLUSION(S): Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention, be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

COVID-19 serology at population scale: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in saliva.,"Randad, Pranay R; Pisanic, Nora; Kruczynski, Kate; Manabe, Yukari C; Thomas, David; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra; Betenbaugh, Michael J; Clarke, William A; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Caturegli, Patrizio P; Larman, H Benjamin; Detrick, Barbara; Fairley, Jessica K; Sherman, Amy C; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Granger, Douglas A; Granger, Steve W; Collins, Matthew; Heaney, Christopher D","Non-invasive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is urgently needed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the general population level. Precise knowledge of population immunity could allow government bodies to make informed decisions about how and when to relax stay-at-home directives and to reopen the economy. We hypothesized that salivary antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the population. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology and tested 167 saliva and 324 serum samples, including 134 and 118 negative saliva and serum samples, respectively, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 33 saliva and 206 serum samples from participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated the correlation of results obtained in saliva vs. serum and determined the sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic media, stratified by antibody isotype, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 case designation for all specimens. Matched serum and saliva SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG responses were significantly correlated. Within the 10-plex SARS-CoV-2 panel, the salivary anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (100% sensitivity at >=10 days post-SARS-CoV-2 symptom onset). The salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response resulted in 100% specificity. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT-PCR, the temporal kinetics of IgG, IgA, and IgM in saliva were consistent with those observed in serum. SARS-CoV-2 appears to trigger a humoral immune response resulting in the almost simultaneous rise of IgG, IgM and IgA levels both in serum and in saliva, mirroring responses consistent with the stimulation of existing, cross-reactive B cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in saliva can play a critically important role in large-scale 'sero'-surveillance to address key public health priorities and guide policy and decision-making for COVID-19.",2020,,medRxiv,,101767986,,,10.1101/2020.05.24.20112300,,#11082,Randad 2020,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""

The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of hospitalized patients presenting with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to April 24, 2020. There were no restrictions regarding publication language. Results: Eighty articles were included analyzing a total of 417 patients with a mean age of 48 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 62% of patients from 82% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies that reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (60%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (21%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (69%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor). Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for the presence and severity of the disease. There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19.

COVID-19 Infection Fatality Rate Associated with Incidence-A Population-Level Analysis of 19 Spanish Autonomous Communities.,"Kenyon, Chris","Previous studies have found large variations in the COVID-19 infection fatality rate (IFR). This study hypothesized that IFR would be influenced by COVID-19 epidemic intensity. We tested the association between epidemic intensity and IFR using serological results from a recent large SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey (N = 60,983) in 19 Spanish regions. The infection fatality rate for Spain as a whole was 1.15% and varied between 0.13% and 3.25% in the regions (median 1.07%, IQR 0.69-1.32%). The IFR by region was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (rho = 0.54; p = 0.0162), cases/100,000 (rho = 0.75; p = 0.002), hospitalizations/100,000 (rho = 0.78; p = 0.0001), mortality/100,000 (rho = 0.77; p = 0.0001) and case fatality rate (rho = 0.49; p = 0.0327). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is not fixed. The Spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 had higher IFRs. These findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of COVID-19 down reduces the IFR and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun, and thus allowing better and lifesaving care.",2020,,Biology (Basel),9,6,,,10.3390/biology9060128,,#11125,Kenyon 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""
"Prevalence of Covid-19 Infection and Subsequent Cohorting in a Residential Substance Use Treatment Program in Boston, MA.","Barocas, Joshua A; Blackstone, Elizabeth; Bouton, Tara C; Kimmel, Simeon D; Caputo, Andrea; Porter, Sarah J; Walley, Alexander Y","OBJECTIVES: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect persons in congregate settings, including those in residential substance use treatment facilities. To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through congregate settings, universal testing may be necessary. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a residential treatment program setting and to understand the unique challenges of Covid-19 transmission in this setting., METHODS: We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result., RESULTS: A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit. Two positive cases resided together with two negative cases in a 4-person room. Two other positive cases resided together in a 2-person room. One positive case resided with two negative cases in a 3-person room. One positive case resided with a negative case in a 2-person room. Based on test results, residents were cohorted by infection status and continued to participate in addiction treatment on-site., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among staff and residents within a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston.

Different longitudinal patterns of nucleic acid and serology testing results based on disease severity of COVID-19 patients,Yongchen Z.; Shen H.; Wang X.; Shi X.; Li Y.; Yan J.; Chen Y.; Gu B.,"Effective strategy to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) require a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emerging virus causing COVID-19. The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported but there is no consensus on their patterns. Here, we conducted a serial investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical symptoms. The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively. Our data revealed different pattern of seroconversion among these groups. All 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Of note, immediate antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation period.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHOD(S): We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULT(S): As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSION(S): In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. Aim and methods: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. Result(s): We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.Copyright © 2020",2020,,Eur.

"COVID-19 in Children, Pregnancy and Neonates: A Review of Epidemiologic and Clinical Features",Zimmermann P.; Curtis N.,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe. In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.Copyright © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Although no complete data were available, between 15% and 55%-60% were asymptomatic, and 75%-100% of cases were from family transmission. Studies analysing school transmission showed children as not a driver of transmission. Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in children <15 years was lower than the general population in the Spanish study., Conclusions: Children are not transmitters to a greater extent than adults. There is a need to improve the validity of epidemiological surveillance to solve current uncertainties, and to take into account social determinants and child health inequalities during and after the current pandemic.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): A review,Feng W.; Zong W.; Wang F.; Ju S.,"In recent years, the prevalence and spread of coronavirus has had a huge impact on global public health. Due to the incomplete understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of the virus, it is difficult for humans to fight against the virus quickly and effectively once the outbreak occurs. In early 2020, a novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. Soon after, similar cases were found in other countries around the world, and the number of infected people increased rapidly. So far, the global cumulative number of infected people has exceeded 3 million, and more than 200,000 people have died, which has had a huge impact on global human health and economic development. Every outbreak of disease makes a deep impression on mankind. Herein, we summarize the virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, and hope that countries can control the outbreak as soon as possible to minimize the loss.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Mol.

Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Narrative Review,Oran D.P.; Topol E.J.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were observed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has been suspected that infected persons who remain asymptomatic play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, but their relative number and effect have been uncertain. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40% to 45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may be associated with subclinical lung abnormalities, as detected by computed tomography. Because of the high risk for silent spread by asymptomatic persons, it is imperative that testing programs include those without symptoms. To supplement conventional diagnostic testing, which is constrained by capacity, cost, and its one-off nature, innovative tactics for public health surveillance, such as crowdsourcing digital wearable data and monitoring sewage sludge, might be helpful.",2020,,Ann.

The new coronavirus that came from the East: analysis of the initial epidemic in Mexico,Ornelas-Aguirre J.M.,"INTRODUCTION: As of March 23, 2020, suspension of non-essential activities was declared in Mexico throughout the country in order to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze data on the first 1,510 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to describe the geographical distribution of the disease and its transmission dynamics. METHOD(S): Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic. RESULT(S): Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported. Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe. CONCLUSION(S): In Mexico, social distancing is being applied, but studies are still required on the dynamics of the epidemic, person-to-person transmission, incidence of subclinical infections, and patient survival.",2020,,Gac Med Mex,156,4,,,,,#7243,Ornelas-Aguirre 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Progression of COVID-19 From Urban to Rural Areas in the United States: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Prevalence Rates.,"Paul, Rajib; Arif, Ahmed A; Adeyemi, Oluwaseun; Ghosh, Subhanwita; Han, Dan","PURPOSE: There are growing signs that the COVID-19 virus has started to spread to rural areas and can impact the rural health care system that is already stretched and lacks resources. To aid in the legislative decision process and proper channelizing of resources, we estimated and compared the county-level change in prevalence rates of COVID-19 by rural-urban status over 3 weeks. Additionally, we identified hotspots based on estimated prevalence rates., METHODS: We used crowdsourced data on COVID-19 and linked them to county-level demographics, smoking rates, and chronic diseases. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm in R-studio. We mapped the estimated prevalence rates using ArcGIS 10.8, and identified hotspots using Gettis-Ord local statistics., FINDINGS: In the rural counties, the mean prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 3.6 per 100,000 population to 43.6 per 100,000 within 3 weeks from April 3 to April 22, 2020. In the urban counties, the median prevalence of COVID-19 increased from 10.1 per 100,000 population to 107.6 per 100,000 within the same period. The COVID-19 adjusted prevalence rates in rural counties were substantially elevated in counties with higher black populations, smoking rates, and obesity rates. Counties with high rates of people aged 25-49 years had increased COVID-19 prevalence rates., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a rapid spread of COVID-19 across urban and rural areas in 21 days. Studies based on quality data are needed to explain further the role of social determinants of health on COVID-19 prevalence.

Estimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of China.,"Menkir, Tigist Ferede; Chin, Taylor; Hay, James A; Surface, Erik; Martinez de Salazar, Pablo; Buckee, Caroline; Mina, Michael J; Khan, Kamran; Watts, Alexander; Lipsitch, Marc; Niehus, Rene","During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 was chiefly reported in the city of Wuhan, cases exported to other locations were largely predicted using flight travel data from Wuhan. However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.",2020,,medRxiv,,101767986,,,10.1101/2020.03.23.20038331,,#11584,Menkir 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

"Public Health Response to COVID-19 Cases in Correctional and Detention Facilities - Louisiana, March-April 2020",Wallace M.; Marlow M.; Simonson S.; Walker M.; Christophe N.; Dominguez O.; Kleamenakis L.; Orellana A.; Pagan-Pena D.; Singh C.; Pogue M.; Saucier L.; Lo T.; Benson K.; Sokol T.,"Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in the control of infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-3). Among >10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities. Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission. In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities. In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities. This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment. During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported. During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases. Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing. CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.",2020,,MMWR Morb.

Spatial analysis of global variability in covid-19 burden,Miller L.E.; Bhattacharyya R.; Miller A.L.,"Background: Since the first occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a number of online tools have become available to assist with tracking Covid-19 prevalence. Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. Method(s): We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. Result(s): The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population. Conclusion(s): Countries with a high Covid-19 prevalence may not have a high incidence, and vice versa. Public health agencies that provide real-time infection tracking tools should report country-specific Covid-19 incidence metrics, in addition to prevalence data.Copyright © 2020 Miller et al.",2020,,Risk Manage.

Is social connectedness a risk factor for the spreading of COVID-19 among older adults? The Italian paradox,Liotta G.; Marazzi M.C.; Orlando S.; Palombi L.,"Italy was one of the first European countries affected by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with over 105,000 infected people and close to 13,000 deaths, until March 31st. The pandemic has hit especially hard because of the country's demographic structure, with a high percentage of older adults. The authors explore the possibility, recently aired in some studies, of extensive intergenerational contact as a possible determinant of the severity of the pandemic among the older Italian adults. We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged >80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity). We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region. Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported. The pandemic was more severe in regions with higher family fragmentation and increased availability of residential health facilities.Copyright © 2020 Liotta et al.

"Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers.","Niehus, Rene; De Salazar, Pablo M; Taylor, Aimee R; Lipsitch, Marc","Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.",2020,,medRxiv,,101767986,,,10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707,,#10971,Niehus 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

The relationship between trends in COVID-19 prevalence and traffic levels in South Korea,Lee H.; Park S.J.; Lee G.R.; Kim J.E.; Lee J.H.; Jung Y.; Nam E.W.,"Objective: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 12, 2020. Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Method(s): This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. Result(s): The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (beta = 43 146; p = 0.056). Conclusion(s): Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",2020,,Int. J. Infect.

"Geographic Differences in COVID-19 Cases, Deaths, and Incidence - United States, February 12-April 7, 2020","","Community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in the United States in February 2020. By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), New York City (NYC), and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19. This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction. In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7). As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC. On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases. Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC. Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices. Monitoring jurisdiction-level numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and changes in incidence is critical for understanding community risk and making decisions about community mitigation, including social distancing, and strategic health care resource allocation.",2020,,MMWR Morb.

Estimating the unreported number of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) cases in China in the first half of january 2020: A data-driven modelling analysis of the early outbreak,Zhao S.; Musa S.S.; Lin Q.; Ran J.; Yang G.; Wang W.; Lou Y.; Yang L.; Gao D.; He D.; Wang M.H.,"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Method(s): We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Result(s): We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403-540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18-25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49-2.63). Conclusion(s): The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

The rate of underascertainment of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection: Estimation using japanese passengers data on evacuation flights,Nishiura H.; Kobayashi T.; Yang Y.; Hayashi K.; Miyama T.; Kinoshita R.; Linton N.M.; Jung S.-M.; Yuan B.; Suzuki A.; Akhmetzhanov A.R.,"From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)-the actual risk of death among all infected individuals-is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Prevalence and severity of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,Hu Y.; Sun J.; Dai Z.; Deng H.; Li X.; Huang Q.; Wu Y.; Sun L.; Xu Y.,"Background: Since being first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 8, 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, has spread globally. Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. Method(s): Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. Result(s): The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively. Conclusion(s): Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,J. Clin.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).",2020,,MMWR Morb.

Biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus COVID-19,"Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood; Meo, Anusha Sultan; Klonoff, David C.; Hoang, Thanh D.","The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to the international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R-2 = 0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.

After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents. METHODS We conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded. Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later. Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic. RESULTS Twenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive. Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days). Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents. As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%). Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide. CONCLUSIONS Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection- control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.Copyright © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.",2020,,New Engl.

We evaluated risk for COVID-19 among frontline HCWs compared to the general community and the influence of PPE., Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of the general community, including frontline HCWs, who reported information through the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application beginning on March 24 (United Kingdom, U.K.) and March 29 (United States, U.S.) through April 23, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive COVID-19 test., Findings: Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 34,435,272 person-days. Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11.6 (95% CI: 10.9 to 12.3) for reporting a positive test. The corresponding aHR was 3.40 (95% CI: 3.37 to 3.43) using an inverse probability weighted Cox model adjusting for the likelihood of receiving a test. A symptom-based classifier of predicted COVID-19 yielded similar risk estimates. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE, the aHRs for reporting a positive test were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.76) for those reporting PPE reuse and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.56) for reporting inadequate PPE. Compared with HCWs reporting adequate PPE who did not care for COVID-19 patients, HCWs caring for patients with documented COVID-19 had aHRs for a positive test of 4.83 (95% CI: 3.99 to 5.85) if they had adequate PPE, 5.06 (95% CI: 3.90 to 6.57) for reused PPE, and 5.91 (95% CI: 4.53 to 7.71) for inadequate PPE., Interpretation: Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 infection, highest among HCWs who reused PPE or had inadequate access to PPE.

A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, these tests have substantially variable sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of NAbs is unknown., METHODS: We determined levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated those measurements with neutralization activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection., FINDINGS: Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, we found particular commercially available tests are capable of accurately measuring levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with neutralization assays., INTERPRETATION: Our findings imply that SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors have a wide range of antibody concentrations. At present it is unclear how antibody acquisition, particularly for low titer individuals, might afford future immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Further research will be required to determine the minimum threshold of antibody and neutralization activity necessary to accurately predict immunity. Correlation of clinical antibody tests with neutralization activity in this study could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.",2020,,medRxiv,,101767986,,,10.1101/2020.06.08.20124792,,#11384,Luchsinger 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; Christian Cao (2020-07-08 17:30:49)(Select): CP donors enrolled in the program were required to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR diagnostic tests and be symptom free for at least 2 weeks; ,""

Longitudinal Change of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019.,"Zhang, Guoxin; Nie, Shuke; Zhang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Zhentao","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged and caused the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide., METHODS: We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 1 February and 29 February 2020. Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen., RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea. All patients underwent antibody tests. Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG. IgM antibody appeared within a week post-disease onset, lasted for 1 month, and gradually decreased, whereas IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection and lasted for a longer time. However, no significant difference in levels of IgM and IgG antibodies between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that serological tests could be a powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.

COVID-19 in Italy: Impact of containment measures and prevalence estimates of infection in the general population,Signorelli C.; Scognamiglio T.; Odone A.,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, the Italian Government implemented several restrictive measures to contain the spread of the infection. Data shows that, among these measures, the lock-down implemented as of 9 March had a positive impact, in particular the central and southern regions of Italy, while other actions appeared to be less effective. When the true prevalence of a disease is unknown, it is possible estimate it, based on mortality data and the assumptive case-fatality rate of the disease. Given these assumptions, the estimated period-prevalence of COVID-19 in Italy varies from 0.35% in Sicily to 13.3% in Lombardy.Copyright © Mattioli 1885.",2020,,Acta Biomed.,91,Supplement 3,175-179,,10.23750/abm.v91i3-S.9511,,#7002,Signorelli 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

COVID-19 in seniors: Findings and lessons from mass screening in a nursing home,Sacco G.; Foucault G.; Briere O.; Annweiler C.,"Background/objective: The COVID-19 epidemic is particularly serious in older adults. The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population, especially in disabled oldest-old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a nursing home, among both residents and caregivers. Design(s): Five-week retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): A middle-sized nursing home in Maine-et-Loire, west of France. Participant(s): Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9 +/- 7.2years; 71 % female) and 92 staff members (38.3 +/- 11.7years; 89 % female) were included. Measurements: Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in both residents and staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recorded. Result(s): The attack rate of COVID-19 was 47 % in residents (case fatality rate, 27 %), and 24 % in staff. Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers. Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness). The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness. Finally, 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Maturitas,141,"(Sacco, Foucault, Briere, Annweiler) Department of Geriatric Medicine and Memory Clinic, Research Center on Autonomy and Longevity, University Hospital, Angers, France",46-52,,10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.06.023,,#9398,Sacco 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Result(s): Overall, 26% (95% CI 22-31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70-336) compared with previous years.

Prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated with biologic agents or small molecules: A population-based study in the first two months of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,Quartuccio L.; Valent F.; Pasut E.; Tascini C.; De Vita S.,"Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) among adult patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules for chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, in particular for chronic inflammatory arthritides. Method(s): To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age > 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N = 1051). Result(s): From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4.5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, P-value = 0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed. Conclusion(s): The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.

However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited. Objective(s): To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Result(s): Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P <.001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.Copyright © 2020 Lai X et al.",2020,,JAMA Netw.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, observational study involves a case series performed at 4 hospitals in West China. Thirty-four pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 27 to February 23, 2020. The final follow-up visit was completed by March 16, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed for 34 pediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, interquartile range 10.00-94.25), among whom 14 males (41%) were included. All the patients in the current study presented mild (18%) or moderate (82%) forms of COVID-19. A total of 48% of patients were noted to be without a history of exposure to an identified source. Mixed infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients (18%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76%) and cough (62%). Expectoration (21%), vomiting (12%), and diarrhea (12%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A substantial increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (among 20 patients with available data; 85%) and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (among 29 patients with available data; 59%), whereas a decrease in prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (among 32 patients with available data; 78%). In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION(S): Our data systemically presented the clinical and epidemiological features, as well as the outcomes, of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Stratified analysis was performed between mild and moderate cases. The findings offer new insight into early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19.",2020,,PLoS Med.,17,6,e1003130,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003130,,#8743,Zhang 2020,"Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; Claire Donnici (2020-07-09 03:26:00)(Select): Did not use serological antibody tests, no seroprevalence estimate; ",""

Healthcare-acquired infection has been reported in similar epidemics, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs and their associated clinical outcomes in the United States. METHOD(S): We established two high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. RESULT(S): Between March 12 and April 23, a total of 3,477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at two employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was similar when comparing frontline HCWs (5.2%) to non-frontline staff (5.5%). Among 174 positive employees reached for follow-up at least 14 days after diagnosis, 6 reported COVID-related hospitalization; all recovered. CONCLUSION(S): During the study period, we observed that the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among symptomatic HCWs was comparable to that of symptomatic non-frontline staff. Reliable and rapid access to testing for employees is essential to preserve the health, safety, and availability of the healthcare workforce during this pandemic and to facilitate the rapid return of SARS-CoV-2 negative employees to work.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

"COVID-19 Testing, Epidemic Features, Hospital Outcomes, and Household Prevalence, New York State-March 2020",Rosenberg E.S.; Dufort E.M.; Blog D.S.; Hall E.W.; Hoefer D.; Backenson B.P.; Muse A.T.; Kirkwood J.N.; George K.S.; Holtgrave D.R.; Hutton B.J.; Zucker H.A.,"BACKGROUND: The United States' COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter. We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations. METHOD(S): Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case's households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULT(S): During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case's households found prevalent infection among 57%; excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among those <5 years to 68% among those >=65 years (p<.0001). CONCLUSION(S): New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

"Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study",Bi Q.; Mei S.; Ye C.; Zou X.; Zhang Z.; Liu X.; Wei L.; Truelove S.A.; Zhang T.; Gao W.; Cheng C.; Tang X.; Wu X.; Wu Y.; Sun B.; Huang S.; Sun Y.; Zhang J.; Ma T.; Lessler J.; Feng T.,"Background: Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. Method(s): From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. Finding(s): Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1-5.0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days (95% CI 1.1-2.7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6.27 [95% CI 1.49-26.33] for household contacts and 7.06 [1.43-34.91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11.2% (95% CI 9.1-13.8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7.4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6.6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.5), with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days (95% CI 5.2-7.6). Interpretation(s): Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Longitudinal Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG Seropositivity to Detect COVID-19.,"Suhandynata, Raymond T; Hoffman, Melissa A; Kelner, Michael J; McLawhon, Ronald W; Reed, Sharon L; Fitzgerald, Robert L","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel beta-coronavirus that has recently emerged as the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests are optimal and recommended for the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests for viral antibodies provide an important tool to diagnose previous exposure to the virus. Here we evaluate the analytical performance parameters of the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG serology assays and describe the kinetics of IgM and IgG seroconversion observed in patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital., METHODS: We validated the performance of the Diazyme assay in 235 subjects to determine specificity. Subsequently, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG seroconversion of 54 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and determined sensitivity of the assay at three different timeframes., RESULT: Sensitivity and specificity for detecting seropositivity at >= 15 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, was 100.0% and 98.7% when assaying for the panel of IgM and IgG. The median time to seropositivity observed for a reactive IgM and IgG result from the date of a positive PCR was 5 days (IQR: 2.75-9 days) and 4 days (IQR: 2.75-6.75 days), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme IgM/IgG assays are suited for the purpose of detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. For the first time, we report longitudinal data showing the evolution of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM in a cohort of acutely ill patients in the United States. We also demonstrate a low false positive rate in patients who were presumed to be disease free.

Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation,Yong S.E.F.; Anderson D.E.; Wei W.E.; Pang J.; Chia W.N.; Tan C.W.; Teoh Y.L.; Rajendram P.; Toh M.P.H.S.; Poh C.; Koh V.T.J.; Lum J.; Suhaimi N.-A.M.; Chia P.Y.; Chen M.I.-C.; Vasoo S.; Ong B.; Leo Y.S.; Wang L.; Lee V.J.M.,"Background: Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. Method(s): In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. Finding(s): Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1.4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. Interpretation(s): Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing - Questions to be asked,Ozcurumez M.K.; Ambrosch A.; Frey O.; Haselmann V.; Holdenrieder S.; Kiehntopf M.; Neumaier M.; Walter M.; Wenzel F.; Wolfel R.; Renz H.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19 disease presents a major healthcare challenge of global dimensions. Laboratory diagnostics of infected patients, and the assessment of immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus presents a major cornerstone in handling the pandemic. Currently there is an increase in demand of antibody testing and a large number of tests are already marketed or in the late stage of development. However, the interpretation of test results depends on many variables and factors, including sensitivity, specificity, potential cross-reactivity and cross-protectivity; the diagnostic value of antibodies of different isotypes, the use of antibody testing in identification of acutely ill patients or in epidemiological settings.

Distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 outbreak in Tamil Nadu: A log-linear regression approach,Bhaskar A.; Ponnuraja C.; Srinivasan R.; Padmanaban S.,"Background: Most of the countries are affected with the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus infection. Understanding the severity and distribution in various regions will help in planning the controlling measures. Objective(s): The objective was to assess the distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu, India. Method(s): The data on the number of infections of COVID-19 have been obtained from the media reports released by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020. Log-linear model has been used to estimate the progression of the COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu. Separate models were employed to model the growth rate and decay rate of the disease. Spatial Poisson regression was used to identify the high-risk areas in the state. Result(s): : The models estimated the doubling time for the number of cases in growth phase as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.70, 9.42) days and halving time in the decay phase as 12.08 (95% CI: 6.79, 54.78) days. The estimated median reproduction numbers were 1.88 (min = 1.09, max = 2.51) and 0.76 (min = 0.56, max = 0.99) in the growth and decay phases, respectively.

Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes,Zhang W.; Du R.-H.; Li B.; Zheng X.-S.; Yang X.-L.; Hu B.; Wang Y.-Y.; Xiao G.-F.; Yan B.; Shi Z.-L.; Zhou P.,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

"Case series of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a military recruit school: clinical, sanitary and logistical implications",Baettig S.J.; Parini A.; Cardona I.; Morand G.B.,"INTRODUCTION: A new coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China in late 2019 and has now caused a worldwide pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting. We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges. METHOD(S): Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions. RESULT(S): The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48hours. Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company. Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96hours. Serological testing revealed positive for both patients. All others showed negative IgM and IgG. CONCLUSION(S): Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers. This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Delayed specific IgM antibody responses observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression,Shen L.; Wang C.; Zhao J.; Tang X.; Shen Y.; Lu M.; Ding Z.; Huang C.; Zhang J.; Li S.; Lan J.; Wong G.; Zhu Y.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide since it was confirmed as the causative agent of COVID-19. Molecular diagnosis of the disease is typically performed via nucleic acid-based detection of the virus from swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the positive rate from the commonly used specimens (swabs or sputum) was less than 75%. Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are needed to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Sera were collected from patients or healthy people in a local hospital in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were then detected using a SARS-CoV-2 IgM colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). Results were analysed in combination with sera collection date and clinical information. The GICA was found to be positive with the detected 82.2% (37/45) of RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as 32.0% (8/25) of clinically confirmed, RT-qPCR negative patients (4-14 days after symptom onset). Investigation of IgM-negative, RT-qPCR-positive COVID-19 patients showed that half of them developed severe disease. The GICA was found to be a useful test to complement existing PCR-based assays for confirmation of COVID-19, and a delayed specific IgM antibody response was observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Testing Asymptomatic Emergency Department Patients for Coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) in a Low Prevalence Region,Ford J.S.; Parikh A.; Sandhu R.; Turnipseed S.; Morris B.; May L.; Holmes J.F.,"The first cases of Coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 20191 . The literature demonstrates geographical variation with regards to estimates of infection incidence, suggesting that COVID-19 has been underdiagnosed in certain regions2,3 . The rate of asymptomatic infection has been estimated to be as high as 30.8%, which may help explain variation in incidence, particularly in regions with differing screening practices 3 . Transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic carriers has been reported in multiple family units, indicating that this mode of infection is important in understanding disease epidemiology and population risk4,5 .Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

We know that the elderly and people with chronic diseases contract the infection more easily and they develop clinically more serious and often lethal forms. To date, the reasons for this have been generically attributed to old age and underlying diseases. Most Covid-19 deaths occurred in long-term care facilities because the residents are elderly people with chronic illness living in close contact. Therefore, facilities have become epidemic outbreaks. Forensic knowledge is very limited because an autopsy is rarely performed. Post-mortem investigations can help increase knowledge about Covid-19 and identify any undiagnosed pathologies in life. Therefore, forensic investigations play a role in protecting a frail population.

"SARS-CoV-2 serology: Test, test, test, but interpret with caution!",Bermingham W.H.; Wilding T.; Beck S.; Huissoon A.,"SARS-CoV-2 serological tests are a subject of intense interest and have the potential to significantly enhance the diagnostic capability of healthcare services in the current pandemic. However, as with all novel assays, significant validation is required to understand the clinical relevance of results.We present the first study to assess clinician interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serology scenarios. We identify common key assumptions regarding patient infectivity and protection that are not currently supported by the SARS-CoV-2 evidence base. In this rapidly developing field, we therefore strongly recommend serological assay results are accompanied by clear interpretive support from laboratory and infectious diseases specialists.Copyright © Royal College of Physicians 2020.

Prevalence and Clinical Presentation of Health Care Workers with Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in 2 Dutch Hospitals during an Early Phase of the Pandemic,Kluytmans-Van Den Bergh M.F.Q.; Buiting A.G.M.; Pas S.D.; Bentvelsen R.G.; Van Den Bijllaardt W.; Van Oudheusden A.J.G.; Van Rijen M.M.L.; Verweij J.J.; Koopmans M.P.G.; Kluytmans J.A.J.W.,"Importance: On February 27, 2020, the first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. Objective(s): To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.Copyright © 2020 Kluytmans-van den Bergh MFQ et al.",2020,,JAMA Netw.

Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS): Cross-Sectional (Nested Cohort) Study Protocol.,"Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent; Stead, David; Singata-Madliki, Mandisa; Batting, Joanne; Hyera, Leo; Jelliman, Eloise; Abrahams, Shareef; Parrish, Andrew","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of infection by the virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Though data exist on the positivity rate of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test as well as COVID-19-related deaths amongst HCWs in South Africa, the overall infection rate remains underestimated by these indicators. It is also unclear whether the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers durable protection against reinfection. This study will assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in the Eastern Cape (EC) and examine the longitudinal changes (rate of decay) in the antibody levels after infection in this cohort. Using a multi-stage cluster sampling of healthcare workers in selected health facilities in the EC, a cross-sectional study of 2250 participants will be recruited. In order to assess the community infection rate, 750 antenatal women in the same settings will be recruited. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) will be used for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. A nested cohort study will be conducted by performing eight-weekly antibody assays (X2) from 201 participants who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Logistic regression models will be fitted to identify the independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and infection fatality rate among the frontline HCWs will be estimated. In addition, the study will highlight the overall effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures (IPC) per exposure sites/wards at the selected health facilities.

A Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive: Can It Lead to Potential Reinfections?.,"Nag, Deb Sanjay; Chaudhry, Rajan; Mishra, Minakshi; Rai, Sudhir; Gupta, Minakshi","Background COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been considered to provide protective immunity and its immunoassays have been widely used for serosurveillance. In our serosurveillance on an industrial workforce of randomly selected 3296 subjects, COVID-19 IgG antibody positivity was reported in 7.37% (243) subjects. However, when 30 days later, eight of the 243 COVID-19 IgG antibody-positive individuals complained of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection and were confirmed as COVID-19 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), their COVID-19 IgG antibodies were retested. Seven of the eight previously IgG positive individuals had lost their protective antibodies. Methods Subsequently, a prospective clinical trial was planned by repeating the test for IgG antibodies on the remaining earlier positive 235 individuals at 45-65 days after their initial test. Only 201 of the 235 individuals consented and participated in the non-randomized single-arm observational trial. Results Only 28.36% (57/201) retained their IgG antibodies and 70.15% (141/201) had lost their IgG antibodies. Three cases reported equivocal results on retesting. Conclusions Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Further studies are needed with a quantitative assay over a period with neutralizing antibodies to establish if its decay can potentially lead to reinfections. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner.

Deaths with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) and excess all cause deaths from the Monitoring Mortality System (MoMo), up to 15 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infections in Spain were derived from the estimated seroprevalence by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for IgG antibodies in 61 098 participants in the ENE-COVID nationwide seroepidemiological survey between 27 April and 22 June 2020., RESULTS: The overall infection fatality risk was 0.8% (19 228 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 95% confidence interval 0.8% to 0.9%) for confirmed covid-19 deaths and 1.1% (24 778 of 2.3 million infected individuals, 1.0% to 1.2%) for excess deaths. The infection fatality risk was 1.1% (95% confidence interval 1.0% to 1.2%) to 1.4% (1.3% to 1.5%) in men and 0.6% (0.5% to 0.6%) to 0.8% (0.7% to 0.8%) in women. The infection fatality risk increased sharply after age 50, ranging from 11.6% (8.1% to 16.5%) to 16.4% (11.4% to 23.2%) in men aged 80 or more and from 4.6% (3.4% to 6.3%) to 6.5% (4.7% to 8.8%) in women aged 80 or more., CONCLUSION: The increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality risk after age 50 appeared to be more noticeable in men than in women.

Pascale"" in NAPLES",Isgro M.A.; Calemma R.; Di Capua L.; Labonia F.; Russo L.; Cavalcanti E. ,"Focusing attention on cancer patients' frailty, Cancer Institute-IRCCS ""Fondazione Pascale"" in Naples has planned a tightened program of health surveillance for patients (PTs) and healthcare providers (HPs), in order to early detect and promptly quarantine subjects with SARSCoV-2 infection. This program requires a multidisciplinary asset, within which Laboratory plays a crucial role. In our experience, the attention has focused on application of biosafety conditions, as stated by World Health Organization's guidance. A validated internal protocol was derived from it. Laboratory diagnostic workflow provided 3 steps: 1) rapid immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG from plasma samples of PTs and HPs; 2) automated qualitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIAs) to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from serum samples of HPs; 3) Real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) of PTs and HPs. Health surveillance program planned an initial evaluation of PTs and HPs with rapid ICAs (automated tests being not available yet) and a further screening with molecular tests on NS sent to external COVID-19 reference Laboratories. Subsequently, our Laboratory was included in CORONET network, allowing us to perform molecular tests for SARSCoV-2. At the same time, availability of automated ECLIAs allowed us to screen HPs periodically, continuing to perform ICAs to all PTs afferent to hospital triage. At the beginning of the surveillance, rapid ICAs allowed to screen 1920 PTs (89 of which resulted positive, 4.63%) and 1050 HPs (48 positive, 4.57%). Subsequently, HPs' screening with ECLIAs revealed 25 positive subjects out of 1018 tested (2.46%). Early detection and quarantine of positive cases allowed to find very low percentages of positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects to molecular tests from NS: 1 positive out 2215 NS from HPs (0.05%) and 1 positive out of 742 NS from PTs (0.13%). All Laboratory staff efforts have been directed to guarantee an adequate turnaround time. The element ""time"" has been crucial to subject promptly to quarantine personnel identified as positive and to isolate patients affected, thus allowing health surveillance program to ensure an adequate protection for cancer patients afferent to our Institute.",2020,/,Biochimica Clinica,44,SUPPL 2,S92,,,633621656,#67572,Isgro 2020,Exclusion reason: Unable to locate full text; ,""
The role of serum specific- SARS-CoV-2 antibody in COVID-19 patients.,"Chen, Hao; Zhang, Xinyu; Liu, Wanjun; Xue, Mingshan; Liao, Chenxi; Huang, Zhifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Sun, Baoqing","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread, resulting in considerable casualties and serious economic loss worldwide. Disease severity and related symptoms markedly vary among individuals. A large number of patients present atypical symptoms, which represent a big challenge for early diagnosis and prompt infection source isolation. Currently, COVID-19 diagnosis predominantly depends on nucleic acid tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens, but this method presents a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy. In the current review, we aim to present comprehensive evidence to clarify the utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a reference for use in the clinic.

A data-driven Bayesian single parameter semi-empirical model was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. COVID-19 prevalence is well-approximated by the geometric mean of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. As of December 8, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 0.8%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 11.1% [CrI: 10.1%-12.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.3% [CrI: 0.2%-0.4%] in Maine to 3.0% [CrI: 1.1%-5.7%] in Pennsylvania, and seroprevalence from 1.4% [CrI: 1.0%-2.0%] in Maine to 22% [CrI: 18%-27%] in New York.

The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focused on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays detecting different classes of antibodies constitute an excellent surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population. In addition, it can contribute to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to identify the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict human population immunity, possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, a subtyping IgG ELISA has been performed. Our findings showed a notable statistical correlation between the neutralization titers and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA responses against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. Thus confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories that do not have biosecurity level-3 facilities.

Samples Management and Data Protection through SARS-Cov2 infection,Giannella E.; Biticchi B.; Notarangelo V.; Balice M.P.; Rossini A.; Salvia A.; Sancesario G. ,"Privacy and security of data are emerged as fundamental parts of routine clinical and laboratory practice. The adoption of electronic medical record, the connectivity of information systems and instruments to Internet have increased the risk for violation of patients privacy. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR 2016/679) defines how personal information must be used by adopting measures that guarantee high level of security. Accordingly, transparency about the generation and managing of data in research became crucial. The most important ethical issue document is represented by the informed consent, which can be signed by the donor to authorize the collection, storage and use of the samples and associated data for specific research purposes. In May 2020, a screening for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 infection in all the patients and employees at the Santa Lucia Foundation, in Rome has been conducted, together with the voluntary opportunity for all the participants to donate biological materials for future researches for COVID-19 disease. Materials: All participants were subjected to nasooropharyngeal swab test for viral SARS-CoV2 RNA detection, and blood sampling, for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment, in electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ""ECLIA"" (Roche). In addition, those who gave voluntary consent for donation to the Biobank, carried out an adjunctive tube for serum sample. According to the GDPR, the informed consent form is divided into two parts: The first for the donation of samples to the biobank and the second for personal data treatment authorization, including i. authorization to personal data processing, ii. genetic data processing, iii. transfer of biological samples and data to third parties in or iv. outside Europe (Research Institute, University, other biobanks), and v. consent to access to the electronic medical record. Result(s): A total of 742 patients and personnel participated at the screening for COVID-19: 468 gave the consent for donation of biological sample to the Biobank, while 43 denied consent. Among donors, 22 (4,7%) refused consent to the transfer/communication of biological samples/associated data to third parties in Europe while 35 (7,5%) denied the transfer/communication outside Europe. Regarding the consent for the genetic data processing, only 5 participants (1,1%) refused authorization. Conclusion(s): The fear of an uncontrolled dissemination of personal data, especially on internet or media, is one of the main reasons that preclude participation in research studies. Donation of biological materials and data for biobanking expose patients and donors to risk of threatening of their privacy, but represent a great need for future of translational medicine. Informed consent defines the authorizations for the processing of patient data and the possibility to withdraw at any time. Finally, transparency and security are the pillars for the patients healthcare.",2020,/,Biochimica Clinica,44,SUPPL 2,S33,,,633621580,#67568,Giannella 2020,Exclusion reason: No seroprevalence estimate; ,""
The diagnostic value of rapid anti IgM and IgG detecting tests in the identification of patients with SARS CoV-2 virus infection,"Vasarhelyi, B.; Kristof, K.; Ostorhazi, E.; Szabo, D.; Prohaszka, Z.; Merkely, B.","Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.",2020,May,Orvosi Hetilap,161,20,807-812,WOS:000531024000001,10.1556/650.2020.31859,,#69186,Vasarhelyi 2020,Exclusion reason: No seroprevalence estimate; ,""

Subtle olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children.,"Concheiro-Guisan, Ana; Fiel-Ozores, Antia; Novoa-Carballal, Reyes; Gonzalez-Duran, Maria Luisa; Portugues de la Red, Mar; Martinez-Reglero, Cristina; Fernandez-Pinilla, Isabel; Gonzalez-Guijarro, Isabel","OBJECTIVES: Anosmia/hyposomia have been described as early signs of COVID-19 infection in adults, including young asymptomatic patients who commonly refer olfactory disfunction as their only clinical manifestation. Very few studies involving paediatric age patients have been published until now. This study aims to determine the presence of olfactory dysfunction in children with COVID-19 infection through the use of a self-reported questionnaire and a new olfactory screening tool., METHODS: Nested case-control study. All paediatric patients screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for COVID-19 infection, during the study period (March-May 2020), were asked to respond to a questionnaire about symptoms of olfactory disfunction. Patients above six years old also performed an odor identification test based on seven odorants (Kradeo R). This test was designed based on our cultural context and eating habits., RESULTS: 126 patients were recruited, including 33 with COVID-19 infection. 15% of the infected children referred anosmia and/or dysgeusia on the questionnaire, all of them were older than eleven years. The results of the odor test (69 patients) revealed subtle disturbances in the infected group (mostly misrecognition of odorants). Median odorant recognition was 3 odors [Interquartile range (IQR) 2-4] in case group and 4 [IQR 3-5] in controls. Male patients showed significantly larger disturbances than girls in both groups (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Self-referred prevalence of olfactory disfunction in our sample of infected children is lower than that described in adults, especially among the youngest ones, maybe due to immature development of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed in nasal mucosa. Nevertheless, one month after infection, subtle disturbances (misrecognition of odors) were identified among the infected children. This screening olfactory test provides a hygienic, user-friendly tool, suitable for screening children older than six years of age. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of three automatic chemiluminescent immunoassays for monitoring dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM.,"Dou, Xiaowen; Wang, Enyun; Hu, Jiwen; Zong, Zengyan; Jiang, Ruiwei; Wang, Mengmeng; Kan, Lijuan; Zhang, Xiuming","BACKGROUND: Seldom performance evaluation and diagnosis comparison studies were reported for different chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) kits approved under an emergency approval program for SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: A total of 100 and 105 serum separately from non-infected populations and COVID-19 patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. The characteristics including precision, functional sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy were evaluated for Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi CLIA kits., RESULTS: Maglumi and iFlash had the best analytical sensitivity for IgM and IgG, respectively. Axceed kits had a linearity response in the detected concentration. The clinical sensitivity of Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi was 68.0%, 64.9%, and 63.9% with a specificity of 99.0%, 96.0%, and 100% for IgM, 85.6%, 97.9%, and 94.8% with a specificity of 97.0% for IgG. ROC analysis indicated all kits had a diagnostic power greater than 0.9. Notably, either IgM or IgG kits obtained a poor agreement (Kappa value from 0.397 to 0.713) with others. Among 38 recovered patients, 94.7% had an effective immune response, and both seropositive IgM and IgG accounted for the biggest proportion (medium, 42 days onset), then followed by the single seropositive IgG (medium, 50 days onset) in Ab profile., CONCLUSION: The performance of CLIA kits satisfied the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Comparison between five different assays to detect the levels of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in human population,D'Agostini M.; Fina F.; Linardos G.; Piccioni L.; Terreri S.; Carsetti R.; Concato C.; Porzio O. ,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapidly spread in the current pandemic. The diagnosis of Covid 19 is based on the detection of viral RNA by molecular amplification (NAAT) in nasopharingeal swabs and virus-specific antibodies of different isotypes in the serum. IgM and IgG anti-Sars CoV-2 appear 4-7 days after the onset of symptoms but the highest level of IgM and IgG are detected after 2-3 weeks and 3-6 weeks, respectively. Serological assays are useful for the diagnosis and for epidemiological studies. To compare different methods, we measured serum antibody levels with three automated assays including ElecsysRoche anti-SarsCov2, Abbott Sars-CoV-2 IgG and Diasorin LiasonSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG in a goup of 50 selected subjects (negative or positive for nasopharingeal swab, initial screening with Abbott serological test or previuos clinical suspect of COVID-19). A good concordance of the results (68%) was found between Roche and Diasorin assays, and between Roche and Abbott tests while the concordance between Abbott and Diasorin is lower (38%). The samples were also analyzed with other 2 non automated assays: Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) and Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgA). The percentage of positivity is 58% with Diasorin LiasonSARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, 42% for Abbott Sars-CoV-2 IgG, 32% for Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgA), 30% for Euroimmun Sars-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) and 28% for Elecsys Roche anti-SarsCov2. The concordance of ~88% and 86% was revealed between Roche test and Euroimmun (IgG), and between Roche and Euroimmun (IgA), respectively, while it reduced to 66% among Diasorin and Euroimmun (IgG) and 62% between Abbott and Euroimmune (IgG).The results in agreement with all five tests were the 34% of total selected cases.

Geography of COVID-19 in Denmark.,"Holmager, Therese Lf; Lynge, Elsebeth; Kann, Caroline E; St-Martin, Gry","Aim: To investigate the COVID-19 situation across geographical areas of Denmark over time. Methods: We used COVID-19 data from the Danish State Serum Institute on national, regional and municipality level. Cumulative number of tests, incidence, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were analysed for the five Danish regions and for all of Denmark. The cumulative number of tested and incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 was compared for the two municipalities, Lolland and Gentofte. A sensitivity analysis of the COVID-19 indicators on a regional level was performed using number of tested as the denominator. Results: The Capital Region ranked highest on all analysed COVID-19 indicators with 10,849 tested, 365 cases, 63 hospitalized and 18 deaths per 100,000 by 2 June 2020. The three regions in western Denmark all had low levels, while Region Zealand ranked second highest. Despite general low health status in Lolland municipality, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was consistently below that of Gentofte. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Capital Region had the highest number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 tested, but Region Zealand had a higher number of hospitalized and similar number of deaths per 100,000 tested as the Capital Region over time. Conclusion: COVID-19 had affected eastern Denmark, especially the Capital Region, considerably more than western Denmark. The difference may relate to population density and housing conditions.

"Opportunity of periodic monitoring of COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic virus carriers, and postinfectious individuals with IgM/IgG rapid antibody tests among healthcare workers during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Rago, Z.; Szijjarto, L.; Duda, E.; Bella, Z.","The first Hungarian COVID-19 case was reported on March 4, 2020 by Hungarian officials. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the highest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with 12% of total coronavirus cases confirmed among them recently. 80% of the infected persons show only mild, moderate symptoms or stay asymptomatic. The single-stranded viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR from the respiratory tract, urine, blood and, particulary in children, from stool samples for 30-40 days. We have no valid data of how many HCWs have been infected since the Hungarian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, due to the lack of the systematic screening. HCWs could play a critical role in transmission and might jeopardize the health of both their patients and their own family members. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal sudies are recommended to evaluate the ratio of the recovered, i.e., ""already protected"", the ones in the acute phase, i.e., ""the infectious"", and the virus-naive, i.e., ""at risk"" workers. Of the available molecular diagnostic options, in addition to RT-PCR it would be advisable to introduce the novel rapid antibody tests which can give quick results, reveal the timeline of the infection, are easy to handle, inexpensive and can be used periodically to monitor HCWs' viral status during the still unkown duration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",2020,May,Orvosi Hetilap,161,21,854-860,WOS:000535920200001,10.1556/650.2020.31862,,#69721,Rago 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Here, we retrospectively analyze 851 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with at least two positive PCR tests and find that 99 of these patients remain SARS-CoV-2-positive after 4 weeks from their initial diagnosis date. For the 851-patient cohort, the mean lower bound of viral RNA shedding was 17.3 days (SD: 7.8), and the mean upper bound of viral RNA shedding from 668 patients transitioning to confirmed PCR-negative status was 22.7 days (SD: 11.8). Among 104 patients with an IgG test result, 90 patients were seropositive to date, with mean upper bound of time to seropositivity from initial diagnosis being 37.8 days (95% CI: 34.3-41.3). Our findings from juxtaposing IgG and PCR tests thus reveal that some SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are non-hospitalized and seropositive, yet actively shed viral RNA (14 of 90 patients).

COVID-19 testing strategy in response to infection among healthcare workers in a large non-COVID-designated hospital.,"Foo, Diana Hui Ping; King, Teck Long; Lee, Huey Chun; Santhramogan, Priyadarvena; Ganasan, Vijay; Fong, Alan Yean Yip; Ngian, Hie Ung","Sarawak General Hospital, which is the only public access tertiary referral center in Sarawak State for all clinical specialties, was designated a hybrid hospital to treat both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. During the initial surge of patients admitted with COVID-19, there was also a corresponding increase in healthcare workers (HCWs) detected with COVID-19 infection. The latter being isolated, and the large number of staff members that had come into contact with COVID-19 being quarantined from work, placed further strain on the healthcare services. The staff mass screening strategy was a policy decision made by the hospital in response to infection among HCWs, and it aimed to reduce in-hospital transmission (particularly among asymptomatic staff), mitigate workforce depletion due to unnecessary quarantining, and protect the healthcare workforce. In this study, we assessed the detection rate of COVID-19 infection from staff mass testing over a five-week period, and described our experience of adopting this surveillance screening strategy alongside ongoing contact tracing and symptomatic screening strategies. Although it was thought that such periodic staff surveillance might be helpful in protecting the healthcare workforce within a short period, the long-term implications, especially in settings with limited resources, is significant and therefore explored in this paper.

In collaboration with the Prevention Department of the Veneto region of Italy, a survey was promoted in nine manufacturing companies in the province of Padua, to investigate the prevalence of asymptomatic SarsCov-2 virus and the immunological status of 1,267 workers., SCOPE: The study was aimed at verifying the effectiveness of measures to contain the virus spread among workers in the workplace as required by the agreement between the social partners signed on March 14, 2020., METHODS: The survey was carried out at workplaces by trained health physicians and almost all company workers enrolled on a voluntary basis. Each worker was tested for viral RNA using nasopharyngeal swab and for IgM and IgG antibodies by drawing venous or capillary blood, according to the availability of tests at that difficult period., RESULTS: Swab-positive workers were 0.3%, and subjects with positive serological tests were 1.6% of the total workers examined., DISCUSSION: The diagnostic test is based on the search for viral RNA through nasopharyngeal swab. To evaluate the immunological status of workers the CLIA or Elisa quantitative serological test should be preferred.

Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers up to six months post disease onset,Figueiredo-Campos P.; Blankenhaus B.; Mota C.; Gomes A.; Serrano M.; Ariotti S.; Costa C.; Nunes-Cabaco H.; Mendes A.M.; Gaspar P.; Pereira-Santos M.C.; Rodrigues F.; Condeco J.; Escoval M.A.; Santos M.; Ramirez M.; Melo-Cristino J.; Simas J.P.; Vasconcelos E.; Afonso A.; Veldhoen M. ,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a human pathogen, causing clinical signs, from fever to pneumonia - COVID-19 - but may remain mild or asymptomatic. To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed. We quantified immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 onset. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 198 post-COVID-19 volunteers. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses follow a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce subsequently, the ability to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies remained robust with confirmed neutralisation activity for up to six months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

The prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID19 disease in a cohort of quarantined subjects.,"Al-Qahtani, Manaf; AlAli, Salman; Abdul Rahman, Abdul Karim; Salman Alsayyad, Adel; Otoom, Sameer; Atkin, Stephen L","BACKGROUND: The frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with viral spread is unclear. Here, we investigated asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection development and progression in subjects undergoing mandatory quarantine on airport arrival., METHODS: 2714 subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and all were quarantined for 2 weeks. Viral retesting was undertaken on symptom development and routinely at 14 days if asymptomatic. Asymptomatic positive patients underwent viral testing every 2 days to determine viral clearance., RESULTS: 188/2714(6.9%) patients became SARS-CoV-2 positive. On arrival, 44/188(23.4%) testing positive were symptomatic and 92/188(48.9%) were asymptomatic (136/188 positive on arrival); all 92 patients remained asymptomatic and were retested every 2-days until viral clearance. 2526 quarantined subjects remained virus free at 14-days. Viral clearance did not differ between these symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (12.6 +/- 1.0days and 12.1 +/- 0.4days, respectively). Of the 52/188(27.7%) testing negative on arrival, 27/52 became positive and developed symptoms from day 2 to day 13 following arrival. 25/188(13.3%) subjects remained asymptomatic and tested positive at day 14; viral testing was undertaken every 2 days in these subjects, 24/188(12.8%) remained asymptomatic with viral clearance (9.4 +/- 0.7days) less than those asymptomatic on arrival(p < 0.002)., CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were more prevalent than those exhibiting symptoms and are an infection reservoir.

Methods: A real-time internet-based survey endorsed by the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiologists (AEPC) Working Groups for Cardiac Imaging and Cardiovascular Intensive Care. Inclusion criteria was children 0-18 years admitted to hospital between February 1 and June 6, 2020 with diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome and acute cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 286 children from 55 centers in 17 European countries were included. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-12.4 years) and 67% were males. The most common cardiovascular complications were shock, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and coronary artery dilatation. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was present in over half of the patients and a vast majority of children had raised cardiac troponin (cTnT) when checked. The biochemical markers of inflammation were raised in majority of patients on admission: elevated CRP, serum ferritin, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, IL-6 level and D-dimers. There was a statistically significant correlation between degree of elevation in cardiac and biochemical parameters and need for intensive care support (p <0.05). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 33.6% while IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 15.7% and IgG 43.6 % cases, respectively when checked. One child died in the study cohort. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement is common in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of children have significantly raised levels of NT pro-BNP, ferritin, D-dimers and cardiac troponin in addition to high CRP and procalcitonin levels.

Result(s): So far 557 pediatricians have participated. Together they care for ca. 670,000 children. They reported 9803 children who presented as suspected cases. The pediatricians themselves had a clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in 3654 children. In 7707 children PCR tests were carried out using nose/throat swabs of which 198 (2.6%) were positive. In addition, 731 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with detection in 82 cases (11.2%). Despite initially positive PCR tests, 47 children had a negative antibody test at least 2 weeks later. Our query as to infections of adults by children yielded only one case, which a telephone enquiry revealed as unlikely. Discussion(s): From an outpatient pediatric perspective COVID-19 is rare.

Symptoms and symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in community-based populations: Results from a statewide epidemiological study.,"Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara; Fadel, William F; Duszynski, Thomas J; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul K; Menachemi, Nir","Background: Prior studies examining symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily descriptive and measured among hospitalized individuals. Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods., Methods: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide seroprevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection., Results: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR=5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR=4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR=2.38, p=0.006), and cough (OR=2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection., Conclusions: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials., Research in Context: Evidence before this study: Using multiple journal articles queried from MEDLINE as well as a Cochrane systematic review, we examined all studies that described symptoms known to be associated with COVID-19. We further examined the guidelines from WHO and CDC on the symptoms those public health authorities consider to be associated with COVID-19. Most of the evidence comes from China, Italy, and the United States. Collectively prior research and guidance suggests there are a dozen symptoms reported by individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in multiple countries. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, anosmia, ageusia, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias, headache, sore throat, chest pain, and gastrointestinal issues. The evidence is generally of low quality as it is descriptive in nature, and it is biased towards hospitalized patients. Most studies report the proportion of patients hospitalized or testing positive for infection who report one or more symptoms within 3-14 days prior to hospitalization or infection. There has been little validation of symptoms among hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. Furthermore, according to a Cochrane review, no studies to date assess combinations of different signs and symptoms. Added value of this study: This study employs multiple, rigorous methods to examine the ability of specific symptoms as well as symptom combinations/groups to predict laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) infection of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the study is unique in its large sample drawn exclusively from community-based populations rather than hospitalized patients. Implication of all the available evidence: Combining the evidence from this study with prior research suggests that anosmia and ageusia are key symptoms that differentiate COVID-19 from influenza-like symptoms. Clinical screening protocols for COVID-19 should look for these symptoms, which are not commonly asked of patients who present to urgent care or hospital with flu-like symptoms., Key points: Important symptoms specific to COVID-19 are fever, anosmia, ageusia, and cough. Two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), yet most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. This study confirms using robust methods the key symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, and it also identifies combinations of symptoms strongly associated with positive infection.",2020,/,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,,101767986,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.11.20210922,33106813,#50344,Dixon 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Three Quarters of People with SARS-CoV-2 Infection are Asymptomatic: Analysis of English Household Survey Data,"Petersen, Irene; Phillips, Andrew","Background: To reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is important to identify those who are infectious. However, little is known about what proportion of infectious people are asymptomatic and potential “silent” transmitters. We evaluated the value of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a representative English survey. Methods: We used data from the Office for National Statistics Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey pilot study. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, the proportion of asymptomatic cases (1 - sensitivity), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of COVID-19 symptoms as a marker of infection using results of the SARS-CoV-2 test as the “gold standard”. Results: In total, there were 36,061 individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 test between 26 April and 27 June 2020. Of these, 625 (1.7%) reported symptoms on the day of the test. There were 115 (0.32%) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Of the 115, there were 27 (23.5%) who were symptomatic and 88 (76.5%) who were asymptomatic on the day of the test. Focusing on those with specific symptoms (cough, and/or fever, and/or loss of taste/smell), there were 158 (0.43%) with such symptoms on the day of the test. Of the 115 with a positive SARS-CoV-2, there were 16 (13.9%) reporting symptoms. In contrast, 99 (86.1%) did not report specific symptoms on the day of the test. The PPV for all symptoms was 4.3% and for the specific symptoms 10.1%. The specificity and NPV of symptoms were above 98%. Conclusion: COVID-19 symptoms are poor markers of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 76.5% of this random sample who tested positive reported no symptoms, and 86.1% reported none of those specific to COVID-19.

Seven state or local health departments conducted initial facility-wide testing of residents and staff members in 288 nursing homes during March 24-June 14, 2020. Two of the seven health departments conducted testing in 195 nursing homes as part of facility-wide testing all nursing homes in their state, which were in low-incidence areas (i.e., the median preceding 14-day cumulative incidence in the surrounding county for each jurisdiction was 19 and 38 cases per 100,000 persons); 125 of the 195 nursing homes had not reported any COVID-19 cases before the testing. Ninety-five of 22,977 (0.4%) persons tested in 29 (23%) of these 125 facilities had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The other five health departments targeted facility-wide testing to 93 nursing homes, where 13,443 persons were tested, and 1,619 (12%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. In regression analyses among 88 of these nursing homes with a documented case before facility-wide testing occurred, each additional day between identification of the first case and completion of facility-wide testing was associated with identification of 1.3 additional cases. Among 62 facilities that could differentiate results by resident and HCP status, an estimated 1.3 HCP cases were identified for every three resident cases. Performing facility-wide testing immediately after identification of a case commonly identifies additional unrecognized cases and, therefore, might maximize the benefits of infection prevention and control interventions. In contrast, facility-wide testing in low-incidence areas without a case has a lower proportion of test positivity; strategies are needed to further optimize testing in these settings.",2020,/,MMWR.

Comparative Analysis of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children,"Li, Jiahui; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Chong, Chia Yin; Maiwald, Matthias; Kam, Kai-qian; Nadua, Karen; Tan, Natalie W. H.; Yung, Chee Fu","Introduction: In this study, a comparison of clinical, epidemiological and laboratory parameters between symptomatic and asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed. Materials and Methods: Data from all children with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), Singapore, from January to May 2020 were analysed. Results: Of the 39 COVID-19 children included, 38.5% were asymptomatic. Household transmission accounted for 95% of cases. The presenting symptoms of symptomatic children were low-grade fever (54.2%), rhinorrhoea (45.8%), sore throat (25%), diarrhoea (12.5%) and acute olfactory dysfunction (5.4%). Children of Chinese ethnicity (37.5% vs 6.7%), complete blood count (45.8% vs 6.7%) and liver enzyme abnormalities (25% vs 7.7%) were more common in symptomatic versus asymptomatic children. All children had a mild disease course and none required oxygen supplementation or intensive care. Conclusions: The high proportion of asymptomatic infected children coupled with household transmission as the main source of paediatric COVID-19 infection underscores the importance of early screening and isolation of children upon detection of an index case of COVID-19 in a household. Symptomatic children were more likely to have abnormal laboratory parameters but they did not have a poorer outcome compared to asymptomatic cases.",2020,,ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE,49,8,530-537,,,,#50837,Li 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Serological cross-reaction and co-infection of dengue and COVID-19 in Asia: Experience from Indonesia.,"Masyeni, Sri; Santoso, Marsha S; Widyaningsih, Putu Dyah; Wedha Asmara, D G; Nainu, Firzan; Harapan, Harapan; Tedjo Sasmono, R","Similar symptoms and laboratory findings between dengue and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose a diagnostic challenge in some dengue-endemic countries in Asia. In this study, we reported three cases of suspected COVID-19-dengue co-infection in hospitals of Bali, Indonesia. Serological data demonstrated that patients with positive results on dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM were also reactive to COVID-19 rapid antibody tests, suggesting dengue-COVID-19 co-infection. However, two patients were later confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, implying a plausible cross-reactivity of anti-dengue and anti-COVID-19 antibodies in the serological test. Co-infection of dengue and COVID-19 was evident in one patient, following confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and DENV infection using NS1 antigen serology test. This case was the first case of dengue and COVID-19 co-infection in Indonesia and at the same time revealed possible cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DENV antibodies based on rapid serological tests. Our study shall raise public health concern for COVID-19 and dengue detection in Indonesia as well as in other dengue-endemic countries as it may present a tip of the dangerous iceberg for the nations' effort to manage of both pathogens.

Preliminary study of serum 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in the diagnosis of COVID-19,Li P.; Li Z.; Zhao S.; Li Q.; Hu Y.; Chen Y.; Yi F.; Xie Q.; Zeng Z.; Deng C.; Wang Z.; Xie X. ,"Objective: To analyze the clinical value of serum 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method(s): A total of 116 patients diagnosed with NCP in the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University were enrolled from January to February 2020 as the disease group. A total of 134 cases, including 84 non-NCP inpatients and 50 healthy individuals served as the control group. Serum samples from all subjects were collected. A fully-automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer was used to detect the concentration of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody single test and combined detection were compared using the chi2 test. chi2 test and Wilcoxon's rank sum test were used to compare the positive rates and concentrations of IgM and IgG antibodies in NCP patients before and after their 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests turning negative, respectively. The change trend of 2019-nCoV antibody concentration in the process of NCP patients was analyzed by Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Result(s): The sensitivity of 2019-nCoV IgG (90.5%, 105/116) was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM (75.9%, 88/116), the difference was statistically significant (chi2=8.91, P<0.05); The specificity of 2019-nCoV IgG (99.3%,133/134) was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM (94.0%, 126/134), the difference was statistically significant (chi2=5.63,P<0.05). The sensitivity (89.7%,87/97) of 2019-nCoV IgM combined with IgG was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM, the difference was statistically significant (chi2=6.89,P<0.05). The specificity (100%, 125/125) of 2019-nCoV IgM combined with IgG was higher than that of 2019-nCoV IgM, the difference was statistically significant (chi2=7.70, P<0.05). After 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test converted to negative, the positive rate (9/17) and concentration [13.0 (4.9, 24.7) AU/ml] of serum 2019-nCoV IgM antibody were significantly lower than those when the nucleic acid test was positive, positive rate (15/17) and concentration [29.5 (14.0, 61.3) AU/ml], respectively (chi2=5.10, Z=-3.195, both P<0.05). In the course of NCP, patients' serum samples were collected from the first day of diagnosis to every three days, three times in total. The first 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody concentrations [19.4 (12.4, 63.7) AU/ml, 105.8 (74.8, 126.1) AU/ml, respectively] were significantly higher than the second concentrations [15.8 (7.1, 40.3)AU/ml, 80.5 (66.7, 105.9) AU/ml], Z were-2.897,-3.179, both P<0.05. Conclusion(s): 2019-nCoV IgG antibody has a good application value in the diagnosis of NCP. The concentration of 2019-nCoV IgM antibody has a certain correlation with the detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. The combination of 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies with 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test may be the best laboratory index for the diagnosis of NCP at present.Copyright © 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association.",2020,/,Chinese Journal of Laboratory Medicine,43,4,352-357,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn114452-20200302-00155,2006829554,#59127,Li 2020,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""

Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up. These data should be taken into account for the interpretation of the serological evidences on SARS-CoV-2 that are emerging nowadays.",2020,/,Scientific reports,10,1,20048,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77125-8,33208819,#52160,Milani 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age(1,2). Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)(3-5). Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population.",,,NATURE IMMUNOLOGY,,,,,10.1038/s41590-020-00826-9,,#51253,,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

This study investigated the outcomes of patients receiving SACT to assess whether they were at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 or having more severe outcomes. Method(s): Data was collected from all patients receiving SACT in two cancer centres as part of CAPITOL (COVID-19 Cancer PatIenT Outcomes in North London). The primary outcome was the effect of clinical characteristics on the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in patients on SACT. We used univariable and multivariable models to analyse outcomes, adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. Result(s): A total of 2871 patients receiving SACT from 2 March to 31 May 2020 were analysed; 68 (2.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Cancer patients receiving SACT were more likely to die if they contracted COVID-19 than those who did not [adjusted (adj.) odds ratio (OR) 9.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.73-16.9].

The aim of this study was to detect outpatient cases with olfactory and taste disorders suspected to mild form of COVID-19 disease in Gorgan city in the north of Iran retrospectively. This study was performed on patients who had the complaints of olfactory disorders during 03/01/2020 to 04/01/2020. They also had the mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The control group included patients who had similar symptoms during this period but did not report olfactory or taste disturbances. Due to the limitations of serologic kits, this study was performed 2-3 months after the onset of symptoms. The number of patients and controls was 72 and 36 respectively. The range and the mean +/- SD of patient's age were 21-63 and 39.82 +/- 9.82 years. In both groups, 44.44% were male and 55.56% were female. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and the serologic tests in both groups was 91.11 +/- 16.20 days. In the cases and controls, the IgG titer was positive in 44.4% and 22.2% and the IgM titer was positive in 5.6% and 8.3% respectively. IgG antibody titers were higher in cases than in the control group (P = 0.024). There was no correlation among antibody titers and the severity of olfactory disturbances, the gender, and the age. The high COVID-19 IgG antibody titer in patients with olfactory disorder during the pandemic can probably be considered as a warning complaint of COVID-19 and may be used for isolation plans.

METHOD(S): A total of 1578 patients admitted into a newly built hospital specialized for COVID-19 treatment in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Clinical features and the levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were analyzed. RESULT(S): In total, 1532 patients (97.2%) were identified as laboratory-confirmed cases. Seventy-seven patients were identified as asymptomatic carriers (n=64) or SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive before symptom onset (n=13). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 80.4% and 96.8%, respectively. The median of IgM and IgG titers were 37.0 AU/mL (IQR: 13.4-81.1 AU/mL) and 156.9 AU/mL (IQR: 102.8-183.3 AU/mL), respectively. The IgM and IgG levels of asymptomatic patients (median titers, 8.3 AU/mL and 100.3 AU/mL) were much lower than those in symptomatic patients (median titers, 38.0 AU/mL and 158.2 AU/mL). A much lower of IgG level was observed in critical ill patients 42 to 60 days after symptom onset. There were 153 patients with viral RNA shedding after IgG detection. These patients had a higher proportion of critical illness during hospitalization (P<0.001) and a longer hospital stay (P<0.001) compared to patients with viral clearance after IgG detection. Coronary heart disease (OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.11-3.24], p=0.020), and ICU admission (OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.31-4.66], p=0.005) were independent risk factors associated with viral RNA shedding after IgG detection.

"Low prevalence (0.13%) of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic pre-operative/pre-procedure patients at a large, academic medical center informs approaches to perioperative care",Singer J.S.; Cheng E.M.; Murad D.A.; de St. Maurice A.; Hines O.J.; Uslan D.Z.; Garner O.; Pregler J.; Bukata S.V.; Pfeffer M.A.; Cherry R.A. ,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reduced performance of elective surgeries and procedures at medical centers across the United States. Awareness of the prevalence of asymptomatic disease is critical for guiding safe approaches to operative/procedural services. As COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has been limited largely to symptomatic patients, health care workers, or to those in communal care centers, data regarding asymptomatic viral disease carriage are limited. Method(s): In this retrospective observational case series evaluating UCLA Health patients enrolled in pre-operative/pre-procedure protocol COVID-19 reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR testing between April 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020, we determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients scheduled for surgeries and procedures. Result(s): Primary outcomes include the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in this asymptomatic population. Secondary data analysis includes overall population testing results and population demographics. Eighteen of 4,751 (0.38%) patients scheduled for upcoming surgeries and high-risk procedures had abnormal (positive/inconclusive) COVID-19 RT-PCR testing results. Six of 18 patients were confirmed asymptomatic and had positive test results. Four of 18 were confirmed asymptomtic and had inconclusive results. Eight of 18 had positive results in the setting of recent symptoms or known COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 0.13%. More than 90% of patients had residential addresses within a 67-mile geographic radius of our medical center, the median age was 58, and there was equal male/female distribution. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrating low levels (0.13% prevalence) of COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic population of patients undergoing scheduled surgeries/procedures in a large urban area have helped to inform perioperative protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% versus 0.66%). The test NG-Test R IgG-IgM COVID-19 showed the highest rates of IgG or IgM reactivities [6.12% (18/294)], while the test BIOSYNEX R COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) showed the lowest rate [1.36% (4/294)]. Some combinations of 2 RDTs in series allowed decreasing significantly the risk of false positive test results., CONCLUSION: Our observations point the risk of false positive reactivities when using currently available RDT for SARS-CoV-2 serological screening, especially for the IgM band, even if the test is CE IVD-labeled and approved by national health authorities, and provide the rational basis for confirmatory testing by another RDT in case of positive initial screening.

A COVID-19 Outbreak in a Rheumatology Department Upon the Early Days of the Pandemic,Romao V.C.; Oliveira-Ramos F.; Cruz-Machado A.R.; Martins P.; Barreira S.; Silva-Dinis J.; Mendonca-Galaio L.; Proenca H.; Cristino J.M.; Sacadura-Leite E.; Khmelinskii N.; Romeu J.C.; Fonseca J.E. ,"Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department early in the pandemic. Method(s): Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Result(s): 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40 +/- 14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28 +/- 18 days), viral shedding (31 +/- 10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51), and work absence (29 +/- 28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response Higher IgG indexes were observed in individuals over 50 years of age (14.5 +/- 7.7 vs. 5.0 +/- 4.4, p = 0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalization, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly symptomatic (1/8) HCW. Conclusion(s): A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognized and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.© Copyright © 2020 Romao, Oliveira-Ramos, Cruz-Machado, Martins, Barreira, Silva-Dinis, Mendonca-Galaio, Proenca, Cristino, Sacadura-Leite, Khmelinskii, Romeu, Fonseca and the CHULN Rheumatology Department.",2020,/,Frontiers in Medicine,7,"(Romao, Oliveira-Ramos, Cruz-Machado, Martins, Barreira, Silva-Dinis, Khmelinskii, Fonseca) Rheumatology Research Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal(Mendonca-Galaio, Sac",576162,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.576162,633057476,#44971,Romao 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

The study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a community-based population with acute loss of smell and/or taste and to compare the frequency of COVID-19 associated symptoms in participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection., METHODS AND FINDINGS: Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19-related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD +/- 12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19-related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p < 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.27-6.36; p < 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that recent loss of smell is a highly specific COVID-19 symptom and should be considered more generally in guiding case isolation, testing, and treatment of COVID-19., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04377815.",2020,/,PLoS medicine,17,10,e1003358,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003358,33001967,#42965,Makaronidis 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

Method(s): We conducted a prospective cohort study on 49 HCWs who worked in close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. HCWs had blood samples taken every 2 weeks to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two different types of assay. Result(s): Forty-nine participants (31 nurses, 15 doctors, 3 other workers) were enrolled. In total, 112 blood samples are obtained from participants. The median work days in 2 weeks was 9 (interquartile range (IQR): 5-10) days. In a single work day, 30 of the 49 participants (61.5%) had contact with patients with suspected or conformed SARS-CoV-2 at least 8 times, and approximately 60% of participants had more than 10 min of contact with a single patient. The median self-reported compliance to PPE was 90% (IQR: 80-100%). Seven participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, none were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, so the positive ELISA results were assumed to be false-positive. Conclusion(s): The study provides evidence that appropriate PPE is sufficient to prevent infection amongHCWs. It is necessary to establish a system that provides a stable supply of PPE for HCWs to perform their duties.Copyright © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",2020,/,Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy,,"(Suzuki, Hayakawa, Wakimoto, Akiyama, Miyazato, Nakamura, Ide, Nomoto, Nakamoto, Ota, Moriyama, Saito, Morioka, Ishikane, Kinoshita, Kutsuna, Ohmagari) Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan(Suz",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.006,2007949713,#39471,Hayakawa 2020,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""
Prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals in the general population of northern Italy and evaluation of a diagnostic serological ELISA test: a cross-sectional study protocol.,"Guerriero, Massimo; Bisoffi, Zeno; Poli, Albino; Micheletto, Claudio; Pomari, Carlo","INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had infected more than 3 172 000 individuals, killing over 224 000 people and spreading to more than 200 countries. Italy was the most affected country in Europe and the third most affected in the world in terms of the number of cases. Therefore, the aims of this study are: (1) to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals among the general population of Verona; (2) to assess the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) of an ELISA serological test for the screening of SARS-CoV-2., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will be carried out on a random sample of subjects aged at least 10 years from the general population of Verona. Participants will undergo the measurement of vital parameters (oxygen saturation measured by oximeter, respiratory rate and body temperature detected by laser thermometer), the administration of a COVID-19-related symptoms questionnaire, the collection of a blood sample and a nasopharyngeal swab. Our evaluation will include the statistical technique of Latent Class Analysis, which will be the basis for the estimation of prevalence., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Verona and Rovigo provinces on 15 April 2020 (internal protocol number 2641CESC). The study results will be submitted for publication in international, peer-reviewed journals and the complete dataset will be deposited in a public repository.

However, there has been little epidemiological research to assess these risks., METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HCW (n = 546) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW; n = 283) with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were recruited from a large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals. In this cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection status (as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs) by healthcare worker status and role., RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among HCW (7.3%) than in NHCW (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7, 9.3%).

236 Access to Covid-19 Testing by Homeless/Housing-Insecure Individuals in Northeast Ohio,Seballos S.S.; Weleff J.; Phelan M. ,"Study Objectives: Homelessness and housing insecurity is a global public health issue that leads to increased mortality from a multitude of health conditions and low life expectancy. The complex interplay between medical, psychiatric and social factors raises questions about how this population accesses available health care resources. This is magnified in times of global health crises, such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients experiencing housing insecurity may have limited access to health care resources, and live in settings, such as homeless shelters, that place them at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions in this population puts them at high risk for developing severe illness associated with COVID-19. Therefore, how this population accesses COVID-19 testing is of public health interest. This study's objective was to compare the testing patterns of homeless/housing insecure patients for COVID-19, as well as results, compared to the general population across a large health system. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 15, 2020 were included, including drive-through, emergency department (ED)-based and inpatient testing. Homeless/housing-insecure patients were identified based on a previously utilized address-based registry: patients listing their address as ""homeless"" or using the address of transitional housing/homeless shelter during at least one ED visit across the health system between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics were calculated and compared with Chi-squared testing. Result(s): During the study period, 21,561 patients were tested for COVID-19, 94 of whom were identified as homeless/housing insecure (0.4%). 3/94 of these patients (3.2%) tested positive for COVID-19, compared to 2,027/21,467 patients (9.4%) in the general population. Out of all patients tested, 12,776 patients had a testing site listed, 78 of whom were homeless/housing insecure. Homeless/housing insecure individuals were significantly more likely to be tested for COVID-19 in the ED setting rather than drive-through testing, X2 (1, N = 12718) = 22.8, p <.00001) [Table 1]. Conclusion(s): In a regional health system during the COVID-19 pandemic, homeless and housing-insecure patients were reliant on the ED to access COVID-19 testing. Despite risk factors in this population for disease transmission, patients had a low likelihood of testing positive, suggesting that the disease is likely underdiagnosed in this population. Expanding testing availability outside of the ED may improve COVID-19 detection and interventions in homeless and housing insecure individuals, and thus inform public health interventions to reduce disease transmission in this high risk population.

Low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma of COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department,Nijhuis R.H.T.; Russcher A.; de Jong G.J.; Jong E.; Herder G.J.M.; Remijn J.A.; Verweij S.P. ,"Correct and reliable identification of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 suspected patients is essential for diagnosis. Respiratory samples should always be tested with real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, blood samples have been tested, but without consistent results and therefore the added value of this sample type is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR in blood samples obtained from PCR-proven COVID-19 patients and in addition to elaborate on the potential use of blood for diagnostics. In this single center study, blood samples drawn from patients at the emergency department with proven COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in respiratory samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Samples from 118 patients were selected, of which 102 could be included in the study (median age was 65 (IQR 10), 65.7 % men). In six (5.9 %) of the tested samples, SARS-CoV-2 was identified by real-time PCR. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by real-time PCR in plasma samples from patients with proven COVID-19, but only in a minority of the patients. Plasma should therefore not be used as primary sample in an acute phase setting to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are important to complete the knowledge on possible sample types to test to diagnose COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,/,Journal of Clinical Virology,133,"(Nijhuis, Russcher, de Jong) Department of Medical Microbiology and Medical Immunology, Meander Medical Center, Amersfoort, Netherlands(Jong, Verweij) Department of Internal Medicine, Meander Medical Center, Amersfoort, Netherlands(Herder) Department of P",104655,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104655,2008065977,#44574,Nijhuis 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Many serological tests are available and require urgent independent validation. Here, we report performance characteristics of Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (OG) and compare it to Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (ASIA). Patients (n = 102) with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were tested. The patients were asymptomatic (n = 2) or had mild (n = 37) or severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in a medical unit (n = 35) or intensive care unit (n = 28). Specificity was evaluated for 42 patients with previous viral and parasitic diseases as well as a high level of rheumatic factor. The sensitivity of OG was 95.8% (95% confidence interval (CI95%], 89.6 to 98.8) for samples collected >= 10 days after the onset of symptoms, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of ASIA of 90.5% (CI95%, 82.8 to 95.6). OG uncovered six false-negative results of ASIA, of which two had only IgM with OG. Specificity was 100% (CI95%, 93.4 to 100) with both tests on samples, including patients infected with endemic coronavirus. Overall, OG performance characteristics indicate that the test is suitable for routine use in clinical laboratories, and its performance is equivalent to that of immunoassay.

Antibodies were detected with seven different commercially available immunoassays. Frequencies of negative RT-PCR and serology results in individuals with COVID-19 were determined and compared to those observed in a validation cohort of Swiss patients (n=211). Results Among COVID-19 patients in Liechtenstein, false-negative RT-PCR at initial presentation was seen in 18% (12/66), whereas negative serology in COVID-19 patients was 4% (3/85). The validation cohort showed similar frequencies: 2/66 (3%) for negative serology, and 16/155 (10%) for false negative RT-PCR. COVID-19 patients with negative follow-up serology tended to have a longer disease duration (p=0.05) and more clinical symptoms than other patients with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The antibody titer from quantitative immunoassays was positively associated with the number of disease symptoms and disease duration (p<0.001). Conclusions RT-PCR at initial presentation in patients with suspected COVID-19 can miss infected patients. Antibody titers of SARS-CoV-2 assays are linked to the number of disease symptoms and the duration of disease.

"The first two months epidimiological study of COVID-19, related public health preparedness, and response to the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan.","Kakakhel, M A; Wu, F; Khan, T A; Feng, H; Hassan, Z; Anwar, Z; Faisal, S; Ali, I; Wang, W","As an underdeveloped country, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has posed a major risk to the health and economy of Pakistan. The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of epidemiologic analysis predicts that there should have been more cases since late March 2020 in Pakistan. We therefore sought to investigate COVID-19's prevalence and epidemiologic trends in Pakistan. Research for COVID-19 is still in its early stages, so data were collected from official websites and research journals, then analyzed for the disease's prevalence, epidemiology, mortality and recoveries. The results indicated that a rapid increase had indeed occurred in the number of COVID-19 infections in Pakistan, with the first case reported on 25 February, 2020. From 25 February 25 to April, 2020, COVID-19 infected 11,155 people in Pakistan, with 237 deaths (2.12%) and 2527 recoveries (19.96%). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the mortality ratio (r = 0.983, r 2 = 0.966; p <= 0.05). We concluded that proper management must be undertaken to improve the quarantine system, and the World Health Organization guidelines must be closely followed to cope with COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, so antiviral drugs (interferon alfa, ribavirin) may be useful to prevent COVID-19; however, severe control measures implemented in China have significantly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Suspected and confirmed cases must be treated in separate rooms. Staying home and social distancing are the safe way to proceed.

Within the United States, some of the most affected regions have been New York, and Northern New Jersey. Our objective is to describe the impact of COVID-19 in a large delivery service in Northern New Jersey, including its effects on labor and delivery (L&D), the newborn nursery, and the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 21, 2020 and May 5, 2020, a total of 78 mothers (3.6% of deliveries) were identified by screening history or examination to either be COVID-19 positive or possible positives (persons under investigation). Of the mothers who were tested after admission to L&D, 28% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: Isolation between mother and infant was recommended in 62 cases, either because the mother was positive for SARS-CoV-2 or because the test was still pending. Fifty-four families (87%) agreed to isolation and separation. The majority of infants, 51 (94%), were initially isolated on the newborn nursery. Six needed NICU admission. No infants had clinical evidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Fourteen infants whose mothers were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and who had been separated from the mother at birth were tested for SARS-CoV-2 postnatally. All were negative. RESULT(S): COVID-19 posed a significant burden to mothers, infants, and staff over the 5-week study period. The yield from screening mothers for COVID-19 on L&D was high. Most families accepted the need for postnatal isolation and separation of mother and newborn. CONCLUSION(S): Our study suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to her fetus/newborn seems to be uncommon if appropriate separation measures are performed at birth. KEY POINTS: . The yield of targeted testing for SARS-CoV-2, on mothers on Labor and Delivery is high.. . Agreement to separation of mothers and infants to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was high.. .

Validation of a chemiluminescent assay for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody,Tre-Hardy M.; Wilmet A.; Beukinga I.; Dogne J.-M.; Douxfils J.; Blairon L.,"Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the availability and quality of both therapeutic and diagnostic methods, the Belgian authorities have decided to launch a procedure for additional evaluation of the performance of serological tests offered for sale on the national territory. This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. The performances of the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided ""real world"" analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. Comparison between the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. This study reports the validation of the LIAISONSARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.Copyright © 2020 ©2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",2020,,Clin.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children - Understanding the immune responses and controlling the pandemic,Lu X.; Xiang Y.; Du H.; Wing-Kin Wong G.,"In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection. With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention. A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.Copyright © 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Serological Approaches for COVID-19: Epidemiologic Perspective on Surveillance and Control,Lee C.Y.-P.; Lin R.T.P.; Renia L.; Ng L.F.P.,"Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has garnered global attention due to its rapid transmission, which has infected more than two million people worldwide. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination. Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments. This review aims to provide a concise yet extensive collation of current immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2, while discussing the strengths, limitations and applications of antibody detection in SARS-CoV-2 research and control.© Copyright © 2020 Lee, Lin, Renia and Ng.",2020,,Front.

"Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China",Niehus R.; De Salazar P.M.; Taylor A.R.; Lipsitch M.,"Background: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method(s): We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Finding(s): The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5-4.4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation(s): Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh.

Coronavirus infection in patients with diabetes.,"Torres-Tamayo, Margarita; Caracas-Portillo, Nacu A; Pena-Aparicio, Berenice; Juarez-Rojas, Juan G; Medina-Urrutia, Aida X; Martinez-Alvarado, Maria Del R","Diabetes mellitus is a complex, multifactorial, chronic disease characterized by impaired metabolism of glucose, fats and proteins. Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality. In this review article we have focused on four specific points: 1) epidemiology of the prevalence and mortality of COVID 19 in the general population and in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) pathophysiology related to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors in subjects with diabetes; 3) the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, and 4) the outpatient and hospital treatment recommended in patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.

About 15% (26/169) HCWs with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Rivett et al., 2020). Here, we show that the proportion of both asymptomatic and symptomatic HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 rapidly declined to near-zero between 25th April and 24th May 2020, corresponding to a decline in patient admissions with COVID-19 during the ongoing UK 'lockdown'. These data demonstrate how infection prevention and control measures including staff testing may help prevent hospitals from becoming independent 'hubs' of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and illustrate how, with appropriate precautions, organizations in other sectors may be able to resume on-site work safely.

"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 16 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 17 May 2020)","","Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 17 May 2020: notifications = 7,075; deaths = 100. The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.Copyright © Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND.",2020,,Commun Dis Intell (2018),44,,,,10.33321/cdi.2020.44.45,,#8389,,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms. Method(s): We recruited adult (>=18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine. Finding(s): On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2-8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57-99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57-99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27-81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35-88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period. Interpretation(s): Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

Before contracting COVID-19, 299 patients had contact with Wuhan residents or contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (31.47%). Also, 138 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection of unknown source (14.53%). COVID-19 patients in the four cities were mainly from Wuhan originally, and had spread infection locally.

"Estimation of COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France",Ceylan Z.,"At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Sci.

"Real-time monitoring the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore, March 2020",Tariq A.; Lee Y.; Roosa K.; Blumberg S.; Yan P.; Ma S.; Chowell G.,"BACKGROUND: As of March 31, 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. METHOD(S): Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULT(S): The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.",2020,,BMC Med,18,1,166,,10.1186/s12916-020-01615-9,,#8357,Tariq 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Epidemiology of the 2020 Pandemic of COVID-19 in the State of Texas: The First Month of Community Spread,Khose S.; Moore J.X.; Wang H.E.,"The pandemic of novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading rapidly across the United States. We provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Texas, which includes vast rural & vulnerable communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this new disease. All 254 Texas counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 from March 1 through April 8, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and case fatality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted incidence and case fatality rates by county-level demographic and healthcare resource factors. Counties which are part of metropolitan regions, such as Harris and Dallas, experienced the highest total number of confirmed cases. However, the highest incidence rates per 100,000 population were in found in counties of Donley (353.5), Castro (136.4), Matagorda (114.4) and Galveston (93.4). Among counties with greater than 10 cases, the highest CFR were observed in counties of Comal (10.3%), Hockley (10%), Hood (10%), and Castro (9.1%). Counties with the highest CFR (>10%) had a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents, adults aged 65 and older, and adults smoking, but lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and number of primary care physicians per 1000 population. Although the urban areas of Texas account for the majority of COVID-19 cases, the higher case-fatality rates and low health care capacity in rural areas need attention.",2020,,J Community Health,,"(Khose) Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics & Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center At Houston, TX, Houston, United States",,,10.1007/s10900-020-00854-4,,#8092,Khose 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""
"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among contacts of individuals with COVID-19 in Hangzhou, China",Wu Y.; Song S.; Kao Q.; Kong Q.; Sun Z.; Wang B.,"Objectives: This study determined the rate of secondary infection among contacts of individuals with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hangzhou according to the type of contacts, the intensity of contacts, and their relationship with the index patient. Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study. Method(s): The analysis used the data of 2994 contacts of 144 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The contacts were categorized according to the information source, type of contact, location, intensity of contact, and relationship with the index patient. Result(s): The incidence of infection differed significantly according to contact type. Of the contacts, 186 (6.2%) developed symptoms, and 71 (2.4%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The main symptoms were cough and fever. Compared with those who had brief contact with the index case, those who had dined with the index case had 2.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; those who had shared transport with, had visited, or had contact with the index case in a medical institution had 3.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection; and household contacts had 41.7 times higher risk of acquiring infection. Family members had 31.6 times higher risk of acquiring infection than healthcare providers or other patients exposed to an index case. Conclusion(s): The form and frequency of contact are the main factors affecting the risk of infection among contacts of individuals with COVID-19. Centralized isolation and observation of close contacts of individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to population-based control measures, can reduce the risk of secondary infections and curb the spread of the infection.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health",2020,,Public Health,185,"(Wu, Song, Kao, Kong, Sun, Wang) Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou Center of Disease Control and Prevention, China",57-59,,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.016,,#9092,Wu 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo' at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI 31.5-54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (i.e. did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI 5.9-9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).

"Addressing COVID-19 Among People Experiencing Homelessness: Description, Adaptation, and Early Findings of a Multiagency Response in Boston",Baggett T.P.; Racine M.W.; Lewis E.; De Las Nueces D.; O'Connell J.J.; Bock B.; Gaeta J.M.,"People experiencing homelessness are at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, in partnership with city and state public health agencies, municipal leaders, and homeless service providers, developed and implemented a citywide COVID-19 care model for this vulnerable population. Components included symptom screening at shelter front doors, expedited testing at pop-up sites, isolation and management venues for symptomatic people under investigation and for people with confirmed disease, quarantine venues for asymptomatic exposed people, and contact investigation and tracing. Real-time disease surveillance efforts in a large shelter outbreak of COVID-19 during the third week of operations illustrated the need for several adaptations to the care model to better respond to the local epidemiology of illness among people experiencing homelessness. Symptom screening was de-emphasized given the high number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections discovered during mass testing; contact tracing and quarantining were phased out under the assumption of universal exposure among the sheltered population; and isolation and management venues were rapidly expanded to accommodate a surge in people with newly diagnosed COVID-19. During the first 6 weeks of operation, 429 of 1297 (33.1%) tested people were positive for COVID-19; of these, 395 people were experiencing homelessness at the time of testing, representing about 10% of the homeless adult population in Boston. Universal testing, as resources permit, is a focal point of ongoing efforts to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on this vulnerable group of people.Copyright © ©2020 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.",2020,,Public Health Rep.,,"(Baggett, Racine, Lewis, De Las Nueces, O'Connell, Bock, Gaeta) Institute for Research, Quality, and Policy in Homeless Health Care, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Boston, MA, United States",,,10.1177/0033354920936227,,#8411,Baggett 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; Claire Donnici (2020-07-08 09:49:55)(Select): No antibody testing or seroprevalence estimate provided.; ,""
Low prevalence and disease severity of COVID-19 in post-liver transplant recipients-A single centre experience,Verma A.; Khorsandi S.E.; Dolcet A.; Prachalias A.; Suddle A.; Heaton N.; Jassem W.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is driving a present day global pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are regarded as a high-risk cohort. The following is a short report on COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients (n = 5) from a high volume UK liver transplant unit with a large follow-up cohort (n = 4500). Based on this limited data, liver transplant recipients appear to have a low incidence of COVID-19, with less severe symptoms than expected, when compared with the general population and other solid organ recipients. This possibly could be related to self-isolation adherence and/or the 'ideal' level of immunosuppression that favourably modulates the immune response to COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Using influenza surveillance networks to estimate state-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,Silverman J.D.; Hupert N.; Washburne A.D.,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections to date has relied heavily on RT-PCR testing. However, limited test availability, high false-negative rates, and the existence of asymptomatic or sub-clinical infections have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be used to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. We found a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average in March 2020 and showed that this surge correlated with COVID-19 case counts across states. If 1/3 of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the US sought care, this ILI surge would have corresponded to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the US during the three-week period from March 8 to March 28, 2020. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to have been doubling slower than every 4 days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID-19 epidemic in the US characterized by rapid spread across the US with over 80% infected patients remaining undetected. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic surveillance for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.Copyright © , American Association for the Advancement of Science.",2020,,Sci Transl Med,,"(Silverman) College of Information Science and Technology, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802, United States",,,10.1126/scitranslmed.abc1126,,#9239,Silverman 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events., Results: Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases., Interpretation & conclusions: The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts. Analysis of the data indicates that for further insight, additional surveillance tools and strategies at the national and sub-national levels are needed.",2020,,Indian J Med Res,151,5,424-437,,10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1896_20,,#11791,ICMRCOVIDStudyGroup(Inalphabeticalorder:PriyaAbraham 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""
Prevalence of Flu-like Symptoms and COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers from India.,"Jha, Sujeet; Soni, Aakriti; Siddiqui, Samreen; Batra, Nitish; Goel, Nikita; Dey, Sneha; Budhiraja, Sandeep; Naithani, Rahul","Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. As the numbers expand exponentially, a paucity of data regarding health care workers (HCWs), who are at the forefront of this disaster, exists. Hence we decided to conduct a study amongst the HCWs to determine the prevalence and risk factor stratification., Methods: This was an online questionnaire-based survey of healthcare workers conducted at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India from 23rd March to 30th April 2020. Data on flu-like symptoms, travel history, posting in high-risk or low risk zones, and prophylactic drugs was collected., Results: Out of the 18000 HCWs who were approached 4403 responded and adequate data of 3667 was available for analysis. 14.7% had flu-like symptoms. 1.8% (20/1113) of the participants tested were positive for the virus. HCWs posted in the high-risk zones had more symptoms than those working in low-risk zones (169/539, 31.4% vs 679/3128, 21.7%), p<0.001; but no difference in COVID-19 positivity rates (p=0.849). Symptomatic HCWs had higher positivity (10/193, 5.2%) than the asymptomatic ones (10/920, 1.1%), p=0.001. HCQ was taken by 755/1113 (67.8%) people and 14 (1.9%) of these reported positive for the virus., Conclusion: This is the first study on healthcare workers from India to the best of our knowledge. Our findings suggest that posting in a high-risk zone with adequate PPE does not pose higher risk to the HCWs. Moreover, HCQ as a prophylactic has no use., ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04339608.

Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study., Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties., Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included., Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty., Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02)., Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19.

The urgency of conducting serological studies for COVID-19,Moradi G.; Mostafavi E.; Haghdoost A.-A.,"Background: COVID-19 has been the most priority of the world since the early 2020s. We aimed to investigate the importance, urgency and value of serological tests for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. Study design: Rapid review. Method(s): This study was conducted through a review of seroepidemiological studies to evaluate their strength and weakness in monitoring and predicting the epidemic situation of COVID-19. Result(s): Conducting serological studies is an important measure to determine the status of the COVID-19 in affected countries. These studies may also be used to estimate cumulative incidence of the disease, and to get an impression about the level of the epidemic. Conclusion(s): If an accurate serological test is available it can be used for seroepidemiological studies and epidemic investigation in special context, but given the current situation, it may not be possible to be used for screening the normal population and in care and treatment.

"Covid-19 epidemic in Italy: evolution, projections and impact of government measures",Sebastiani G.; Massa M.; Riboli E.,"We report on the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy in relation to the extraordinary measures implemented by the Italian Government between the 24th of February and the 12th of March. We analysed the Covid-19 cumulative incidence (CI) using data from the 1st to the 31st of March. We estimated that in Lombardy, the worst hit region in Italy, the observed Covid-19 CI diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7-10 days after the measures implementation. The Covid-19 CI growth rate peaked in Lombardy the 22nd of March and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of March. The CI growth rate peaked in 87 out of 107 Italian provinces on average 13.6 days after the measures implementation. We projected that the CI growth rate in Lombardy should substantially slow by mid-May 2020. Other regions should follow a similar pattern. Our projections assume that the government measures will remain in place during this period. The evolution of the epidemic in different Italian regions suggests that the earlier the measures were taken in relation to the stage of the epidemic, the lower the total cumulative incidence achieved during this epidemic wave. Our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the Covid-19 CI growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid-March (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern Italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid-March to reach the high levels already present in northern regions. As several governments indicate that their aim is to ""push down"" the epidemic curve, the evolution of the epidemic in Italy supports the WHO recommendation that strict containment measures should be introduced as early as possible in the epidemic curve.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Eur.

"COVID-19 cases are less prevalent in countries where malaria is endemic, suggesting a role for anti-malarial drugs as prophylaxis",Adams D.; Alshaban F.,"Almost every country across the world has felt the repercussions of the pandemic of disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A recently published article points to a method of prevention and prophylaxis of COVID-19 through the use of anti-malarial drugs such as the 4-aminoquinolones: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on their mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. This report aims to explore the correlation between COVID-19 cases and countries where malaria is prevalent using statistical means. It is hypothesized that countries where malaria is endemic will have few cases of COVID-19 since these countries use the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the numbers and incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths are substantially lower (multiple-fold lower) in countries with the highest prevalence of malaria. The difference between both the COVID-19 incidence rate and the COVID-19 mortality rate in malaria prevalent countries compared to COVID-19 prevalent countries is statistically significant (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). This study provides further evidence that anti-malaria drugs may prove essential to breaking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 related mortality. As the pandemic continues to evolve and doctors and researchers across the globe try to attenuate or stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the medical community should not overlook the potential role of the 4-aminoquinolones anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and 8-aminoquinolone anti-malaria drugs, tafenoquine and primaquine, as a prophylaxis.Copyright © Adams and Alshaban, 2020.",2020,,Eye Rep.,6,1,S11-S16,,10.16964/er.v6i1.100,,#6637,Adams 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""
"Test, test, test for COVID-19 antibodies: the importance of sensitivity, specificity and predictive powers",Kumleben N.; Bhopal R.; Czypionka T.; Gruer L.; Kock R.; Stebbing J.; Stigler F.L.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody tests of varying specificity and sensitivity are now available. For informing individuals whether they have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they need to be very accurate. For measuring population prevalence of past infection, the numbers of false positives and negatives need to be roughly equal. With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed. Giving false reassurance on which personal or societal decisions might be based could be harmful for individuals, undermine public confidence and foster further outbreaks.Copyright © 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health",2020,,Public Health,185,"(Kumleben) Greenmantle LLC, New York City, NY 10010, United States",88-90,,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.006,,#8978,Kumleben 2020,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design (anything other than cross sectional, repeated cross sectional, or cohort) ; ",""
Dynamic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and neutralizing antibody in children with COVID-19,Liu P.; Cai J.; Jia R.; Xia S.; Wang X.; Cao L.; Zeng M.; Xu J.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and quickly spread globally. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs. Three of eight patients produced NAbs in the acute phase, and NAbs were detected in all eight patients with convalescent sera. The results of this study provide valuable information for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in children.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The right to know: ethical implications of antibody testing for healthcare workers and overlooked societal implications,Vakharia K.,"After the initial surge in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19), the outbreak has been managed differently in different countries. In the USA, it has been managed in many different ways between states, cities and even counties. This disparity is slowly becoming more and more pronounced with the advent of antibody testing. Although many argue over the potential merits of antibody testing as an immunity passport to allow the economy to restart, there are other implications that stand at the heart of the bioethical debate that are often overlooked. Particularly with COVID-19, there are many uncertainties and the discourse alone of antibodies presumes misinformation that may outweigh the epidemiological benefits of antibody testing. Although this paper does not seek to eliminate antibody testing, it does highlight the need for appropriate counselling both on a personal level with each patient but on a more global level. This moral standard of appropriate education is key to allowing the continued autonomy needed during this pandemic.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Mexico: from the 27th of February to the 30th of April 2020,Suarez V.; Suarez Quezada M.; Oros Ruiz S.; Ronquillo De Jesus E.,"Background: The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020. On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. Method(s): We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. Result(s): In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Interna (SEMI)",2020,,Rev.

At the time we write this article, our country is facing a community spread phase, expecting a rapid increase in the number of cases and fatalities. The Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara has been declared a non-COVID-19 hospital with the mission of providing care to patients already registered and also those transferred from neurosurgical departments of neighboring centers, which have been converted into COVID-19 only hospitals. Method(s): An organized response regarding personnel, surgical case selection, operating room behavior, and facility reorganization were designed to prevent an internal coronavirus outbreak in the neurosurgery department at the Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara. Result(s): Distancing actions by the staff and residents, including ward case discussions, neurosurgery rounds, and classes, will be carried out virtually. We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and >14 days. Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility. Conclusion(s): Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period. Specific measures must be taken to ensure the safety and care of neurosurgical patients and medical staff during the community spread phase.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,,World Neurosurg.,,"(Nunez-Velasco, Mercado-Pimentel, Ochoa-Plascencia, Lopez-Espinoza, Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Estrella-Sanchez, Ramirez-Huerta) Department of Neurosurgery, Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico",,,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.019,,#7066,Nunez-Velasco 2020,Exclusion reason:  No serological antibody testing ; ,""

Combination of serological total antibody and RT-PCR test for detection of SARS-COV-2 infections,Wang P.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of serological total antibody tests combined with RT-PCR for detection of SARS-COV-2. We conducted a retrospective study in which 375 patients were enrolled during the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 from 25th January to 16th March 2020. Patients were divided into a COVID-19 group (n = 141) and a control group (n = 234). Serum samples and throat swabs were collected from 375 patients for total antibody testing against SARS-COV-2 and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. The results indicated that diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95.7 % and 98.7 %, 92.2 % and 100 % by total antibody tests and RT-PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of total antibody tests combined with RT-PCR were 98.6 % and 98.7 %. The sensitivity of the combined method was significantly higher than RT-PCR (X2 = 5.16, P < 0.05), and similar to that of total antibody tests (X2 = 1.15, P> 0.05). This study supported the advantage of the combined method for detection of SARS-COV-2 with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, as a useful tool for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of suspected patients, epidemiological investigation, as well as monitoring ongoing outbreaks of infections with SARS-COV-2.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,J.

Serology confirms SARS-CoV-2 infection in PCR-negative children presenting with Paediatric Inflammatory Multi-System Syndrome.,"Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Faustini, Sian E; Jossi, Sian E; Shields, Adrian M; Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Allen, Joel D; Watanabe, Yasunori; Goodall, Margaret; Wraith, David C; Veenith, Tonny V; Drayson, Mark T; Jyothish, Deepthi; Al-Abadi, Eslam; Chikermane, Ashish; Welch, Steven B; Masilamani, Kavitha; Hackett, Scott; Crispin, Max; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Cunningham, Adam F; Richter, Alex G","Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak, reports have surfaced of children who present with features of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome - Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome- temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (PIMS-TS). Initial reports find that many of the children are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, so it is difficult to confirm whether this syndrome is a late complication of viral infection in an age group largely spared the worst consequences of this infection, or if this syndrome reflects enhanced surveillance., Methods: Children hospitalised for symptoms consistent with PIMS-TS between 28 April and 8 May 2020, and who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, were tested for antibodies to viral spike glycoprotein using an ELISA test., Results: Eight patients (age range 7-14 years, 63% male) fulfilled case-definition for PIMS-TS during the study period. Six of the eight patients required admission to intensive care. All patients exhibited significant IgG and IgA responses to viral spike glycoprotein. Further assessment showed that the IgG isotypes detected in children with PIMS-TS were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, a distribution similar to that observed in samples from hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 were not detected in children or adults. IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses., Conclusions: Strong IgG antibody responses can be detected in PCR-negative children with PIMS-TS. The low detection rate of IgM in these patients is consistent with infection having occurred weeks previously and that the syndrome onset occurs well after the control of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This implies that the disease is largely immune-mediated. Lastly, this indicates that serology can be an appropriate diagnostic tool in select patient groups.",2020,,medRxiv,,101767986,,,10.1101/2020.06.05.20123117,,#11933,Perez-Toledo 2020,Exclusion reason: People with confirmed/suspect covid-19 + no subgroups; ,""

An Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Within a Skilled Nursing Facility Using Heat Maps,Blackman C.; Farber S.; Feifer R.A.; Mor V.; White E.M.,"OBJECTIVES: To illustrate dissemination and asymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during a skilled nursing facility (SNF) outbreak. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150-bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULT(S): The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION(S): Early, rapid, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay-at-home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self-quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long-term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.Copyright © 2020 The American Geriatrics Society",2020,,J.

Age-Dependent Risks of Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and Other Parts of China,Li H.; Wang S.; Zhong F.; Bao W.; Li Y.; Liu L.; Wang H.; He Y.,"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Wang, Zhong, Bao, Li, Liu, Wang and He.",2020,,Front.

The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed on January 31. In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic. Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.",2020,,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,54,5,491-493,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200204-00065,,#7506,Bai 2020,"Exclusion reason: No serological antibody testing ; Claire Donnici (2020-07-08 11:13:48)(Select): COVID-19 patients, and close contact person.; ",""

"Clinical features of familial clustering in patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China",Li J.; Gong X.; Wang Z.; Chen R.; Li T.; Zeng D.; Li M.,"An epidemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has appeared in Wuhan City in December 2019. The disease has shown a ""clustering epidemic"" pattern, and family-clustered onset has been the main characteristic. We collected data about 130 cases from 35 cluster-onset families (COFs) and 41 cases from 16 solitary-onset families (SOFs). The incidence of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in COFs was significantly higher than that of SOFs. Our study also showed that patients with exposure to high-risk factors (respiratory droplets and close contact), advanced age, and comorbidities were more likely to develop COVID-19 in the COFs. In addition, advanced age and elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were risk factors for death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COFs.Copyright © 2020",2020,,Virus Res.,286,"(Li, Gong, Li, Zeng, Li) Departments of Infectious Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China",198043,,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198043,,#8919,Li 2020,"Exclusion reason: Estimates included people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19; Claire Donnici (2020-07-09 03:50:44)(Select): No seroprevalence estimate, familial cluster; ",""

Clinical features of covid-19 in children,Bal Z.S.; Kurugol Z.; Ozkinay F.,"In early December, pneumonia cases of unknown origin started to appear and, on the 7th of January 2020, these cases were declared to be caused by a novel beta-coronavirus according to viral genome sequencing on the 11th of February, 2020. Coronaviruses are enveloped, single strand RNA viruses that have been known to have the ability to mutate rapidly, alter tissue tropism and adjust to different epidemiological situations. As of the end of April 2020, 122,392 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been detected in Turkey, of whom 3,258 died. From the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, children seem to be less affected than adults. Therefore, there are limited data regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. The majority of children with confirmed COVID-19 had a history of household contact. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Previous data suggest that nearly half of patients are afebrile at the onset of the disease. Hospitalization and PICU admission rates for children were lower than for adults. However, PICU admission can be necessitated in children with severe disease. Infants, particularly under the age of 12 months, were more likely to develop severe disease. In children, milder and asymptomatic cases can be challenging and can play a role in transmission. In particular, clinicians should test those children who have a history of family cluster even though they are asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms.Copyright © 2020 by Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics and Ege Children's Foundation The Journal of Pediatric Research, published by Galenos Publishing House.",2020,,J.

A comparison study of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients: A possible reason underlying different outcome between sex,Zeng F.; Dai C.; Cai P.; Wang J.; Xu L.; Li J.; Hu G.; Wang Z.; Zheng F.; Wang L.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 has spread throughout the world and caused many thousands of deaths. The previous study reported a higher severe status rate and mortality rate in male patients in China. However, the reason underlying this difference has not been reported. The convalescent plasma containing a high level of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China. In this study, to compare the differences of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female patients, a total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The serum of these patients was collected during hospitalization and detected for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients. In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Our study identified a discrepancy in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to a different outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 between sex.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2020,,J.

Characteristics of Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Confirmed using an IgM-IgG Antibody Test,Xie J.; Ding C.; Li J.; Wang Y.; Guo H.; Lu Z.; Wang J.; Zheng C.; Jin T.; Gao Y.; He H.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly developed into a pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019. Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

A preliminary study on serological assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 238 admitted hospital patients,Liu L.; Liu W.; Zheng Y.; Jiang X.; Kou G.; Ding J.; Wang Q.; Huang Q.; Ding Y.; Ni W.; Wu W.; Tang S.; Tan L.; Hu Z.; Xu W.; Zhang Y.; Zhang B.; Tang Z.; Zhang X.; Li H.; Rao Z.; Jiang H.; Ren X.; Wang S.; Zheng S.,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients between February 6 and February 14, 2020 with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on pharyngeal swab specimens using real time RT-PCR. 194 (81.5%) of the serums were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibodies between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85), whose nucleic acid tests were negative. The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped from below 50% to over 80%. However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. Overall, the suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After the 11th day post-disease onset, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.Copyright © 2020",2020,,Microbes Infect.,,"(Liu, Liu, Zheng, Kou, Ding, Ni, Wu, Tang, Zheng) Department of Transfusion, General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, China",,,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.05.008,,#6736,Liu 2020,Exclusion reason: All included people had confirmed (PCR) or suspected (symptoms) COVID-19 prior to the antibody test; Claire Donnici (2020-07-08 09:42:49)(Select): This study looked at patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. ; ,""
