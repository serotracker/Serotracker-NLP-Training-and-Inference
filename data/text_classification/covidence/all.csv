Influence of obesity on serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients.,"Frasca, Daniela; Reidy, Lisa; Cray, Carolyn; Diaz, Alain; Romero, Maria; Kahl, Kristin; Blomberg, Bonnie B","SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2), cause of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019), represents a significant risk to people living with pre-existing conditions associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and consequent dysfunctional immunity. In this paper, we have evaluated the influence of obesity, a condition associated with chronic systemic inflammation, on the secretion of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19 patients. Our hypothesis is that obesity is associated with reduced amounts of specific IgG antibodies. Results have confirmed our hypothesis and have shown that SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are negatively associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in COVID-19 obese patients, as expected based on the known influence of obesity on humoral immunity. Antibodies in COVID-19 obese patients are also negatively associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers of inflammaging and pulmonary inflammation, such as SAA (serum amyloid A protein), CRP (C-reactive protein), and ferritin, but positively associated with NEFA (nonesterified fatty acids). These results altogether could help to identify an inflammatory signature with strong predictive value for immune dysfunction. Inflammatory markers identified may subsequently be targeted to improve humoral immunity in individuals with obesity and in individuals with other chronic inflammatory conditions.",2021,/,PloS one,16,3,e0245424,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245424,33760825,#91043,Frasca 2021,"",""
Caring for caregivers: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those responsible for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,"Alessi, Janine; de Oliveira, Giovana Berger; Feiden, Gabriela; Schaan, Beatriz D; Telo, Gabriela Heiden","This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on guardians of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. An online survey was performed to assess the prevalence of pandemic-related emotional burden, mental health disorders and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers of children and adolescents with diabetes under the age of 18 and caregivers of youth without diabetes for the non-diabetes group were invited to participate. For the primary outcome, mental health disorders were evaluated using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), while pandemic-related emotional burden and diabetes-specific emotional burden related to diabetes care were evaluated in different domains with specific questions. For analyses, a hierarchical testing strategy was performed. A total of 764 participants were included in the study. Regarding the pandemic period, caregivers of youth with type 1 diabetes endorsed significantly more pandemic-related emotional burden for both themselves (OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.53) and for their child (OR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.38) when compared to the non-diabetes group. The emotional burden evaluation on different age ranges showed that the two groups were similar when the dependent youth was younger than 6 years. Moreover, a positive screening for mental health disorders during social distancing was higher in the diabetes group compared to the non-diabetes group (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.70 to 3.47), particularly in those aged under 12 years old. There was no difference between groups in mental health disorders among caregivers of adolescents older than 12 years. Our results allow to conclude that concern, burden and mental health disorders can be present in caregivers of youth with diabetes, and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance this situation.",2021,/,Scientific reports,11,1,6812,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85874-3,33762633,#91021,Alessi 2021,"",""

Applying serology screening tests could enlighten the view with regards to disease prevalence in dialysis wards. Methods: We subjected 328 end-stage renal disease patients to maintenance hemodialysis. After dividing patients into suspicious and non-suspicious groups for COVID-19 infection based on their clinical manifestation, they were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG screening against nucleoprotein (NP), spike protein (SP), and receptor-binding domain (RBD), utilizing our recently developed ELISA tests. Results: We found that approximately 10.1% of asymptomatically tested cases were antibody positive. Although IgG positivity showed a higher prevalence than IgM across all three virus antigen subunits, there were no significant differences among mentioned immunoglobulins of the studied groups. The most prevalent antibody was from the IgG subtype against virus nucleoprotein (NP), while the lowest prevalence was attributed to receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgM.

"Comparative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 serology in healthcare workers with Abbott Architect, Roche Elecsys and The Binding site ELISA immunoassays","Mohanraj, Dinesh; Whitelegg, Alison; Bicknell, Kelly; Bhole, Malini; Taylor, Lorna; Webber, Caroline","<h4>Purpose</h4> SARS-CoV-2 serology testing is key for assessing seroprevalence and antibody response post-vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Evaluation of current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays have been performed on samples from severe COVID-19 hospitalised patients. However, robust assay development requires assessment in asymptomatic and non-hospitalised individuals to determine if serological assays are sensitive to detect waning and mild antibody responses. Our study evaluated the performance characteristics between two high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assays (Abbott and Roche) and The binding site (TBS) Anti-Spike IgG/A/M ELISA kit in healthcare workers. <h4>Methods</h4> 236 samples were collected from Portsmouth Hospital University NHS Trust (PHU) and The Dudley Group NHS Trust and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serology. We derived concordance, agreement and assay performance as well as using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to redefine the assay threshold of the Abbott assay. <h4>Results</h4> <h4>Result: </h4> concordance between the Abbott and TBS was 66%. Discrepant samples were analysed using the Roche assay which showed 100% agreement with the TBS assay. In samples analysed >58 days post-PCR, the sensitivity of Abbott and Roche was 100%. In samples analysed >100 days post-PCR the sensitivity of the Abbott assay dropped to 77.2% but remained at 100% for the Roche assay. A redefined Abbott threshold of 0.64 increased the sensitivity to 90% giving results similar to Roche and TBS assays <h4>Conclusion</h4> This study demonstrated Abbott assay had a lower sensitivity in comparison to TBS and Roche. Furthermore, TBS can be implemented as a viable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 serology testing where high-throughput assays are not available on site.

Why coronavirus survives longer on impermeable than porous surfaces.,"Chatterjee, Sanghamitro; Murallidharan, Janani Srree; Agrawal, Amit; Bhardwaj, Rajneesh","Previous studies reported that the drying time of a respiratory droplet on an impermeable surface along with a residual film left on it is correlated with the coronavirus survival time. Notably, earlier virus titer measurements revealed that the survival time is surprisingly less on porous surfaces such as paper and cloth than that on impermeable surfaces. Previous studies could not capture this distinct aspect of the porous media. We demonstrate how the mass loss of a respiratory droplet and the evaporation mechanism of a thin liquid film are modified for the porous media, which leads to a faster decay of the coronavirus on such media. While diffusion-limited evaporation governs the mass loss from the bulk droplet for the impermeable surface, a much faster capillary imbibition process dominates the mass loss for the porous material. After the bulk droplet vanishes, a thin liquid film remaining on the exposed solid area serves as a medium for the virus survival. However, the thin film evaporates much faster on porous surfaces than on impermeable surfaces. The aforesaid faster film evaporation is attributed to droplet spreading due to the capillary action between the contact line and fibers present on the porous surface and the modified effective wetted area due to the voids of porous materials, which leads to an enhanced disjoining pressure within the film, thereby accelerating the film evaporation. Therefore, the porous materials are less susceptible to virus survival. The findings have been compared with the previous virus titer measurements.

A fractional-order compartmental model for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Biala, T A; Khaliq, A Q M","We propose a time-fractional compartmental model (SEI A I S HRD) comprising of the susceptible, exposed, infected (asymptomatic and symptomatic), hospitalized, recovered and dead population for the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the properties and dynamics of the proposed model. The conditions under which the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable are discussed. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. As stay-at-home orders are rescinded in some of these states, we see that the number of cases began to increase almost immediately and may continue to rise until the end of the year 2020 unless stricter measures are taken.

"COVID-19 outbreak among temporary foreign workers in British Columbia, March to May 2020.","Mema, Silvina; Frosst, Gillian; Hanson, Kristen; Yates, Cheryl; Anderson, Amanda; Jacobsen, Jennifer; Guinard, Caroline; Lima, America; Andersen, Tannis; Roe, Melissa","Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, temporary foreign workers (TFWs) provided a critical role to maintaining the food supply in Canada, yet workers faced a number of challenges that made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological investigation and public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak among TFWs in an agricultural setting in British Columbia from March to May 2020., Methods: An outbreak was declared on March 28, 2020 following detection of two cases of COVID-19 among a group of 63 TFWs employed by a nursery and garden centre. Outbreak control measures included immediate isolation of cases, case finding via outreach screening and testing, cohorting of asymptomatic workers and enhanced cleaning and disinfection. The outbreak was declared over on May 10, 2020., Results: A total of 26 COVID-19 cases were identified among the group of TFWs; no cases were identified among local workers. Cases were primarily male (77%) with a median age of 41 years. Symptom onsets ranged from March 8 to April 9, 2020. One case required overnight hospitalization for pneumonia., Conclusion: This was the first COVID-19 community outbreak identified in British Columbia and the first COVID-19 outbreak identified among TFWs in Canada. This outbreak began prior to implementation of provincial and federal quarantine orders for international travellers.

Three periods are identified : before, during and after the 1st wave of COVID-19. Over all these periods, a sub-mortality of -3.3 % is obtained at the national level. However, if we restrict the analysis to the period during the first wave and to the cantons most affected by the virus, we obtain an important excess mortality, up to more than 80 % in Ticino, showing that these calculations depend crucially on when, where and for whom the deaths are counted.

Distinct Characteristics of COVID-19 Infection in Children.,"Han, Xuejiao; Li, Xuemei; Xiao, Yinan; Yang, Ruoning; Wang, Yang; Wei, Xiawei","SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family coronaviridae, has triggered a lethal pandemic termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pediatric patients, mainly from families with a cluster of infection or a history of exposure to epidemic areas, get infected via direct contacts or air-borne droplets. Children (aged below 18 years) are susceptible to COVID-19, with an average incubation period of about 6.5 days. Most cases present asymptomatic or common cold symptoms such as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, which is milder than adult patients. Besides, most abnormal laboratory and radiologic findings in children with COVID-19 are non-specific. Since no specific chemotherapeutic agents have been approved for children, timely preventive methods could effectively forestall the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To date, mostly studied cases have been adults with COVID-19, whereas data on pediatrics patients remain poorly defined. We herein conducted a literature review for papers published in PubMed and medRxiv (preprints) between December 2019 and December 2020 that reported on pediatrics patients (aged below 18 years) with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

We developed a statistical framework to explore the association between molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level disease transmissibility of COVID-19., METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous transmissibility of COVID-19 by using the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). The mutation activity in SARS-CoV-2 is quantified empirically depending on (i) the prevalence of emerged amino acid substitutions and (ii) the frequency of these substitutions in the whole sequence. Using the likelihood-based approach, a statistical framework is developed to examine the association between mutation activity and Rt. We adopted the COVID-19 surveillance data in California as an example for demonstration., RESULTS: We found a significant positive association between population-level COVID-19 transmissibility and the D614G substitution on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We estimate that a per 0.01 increase in the prevalence of glycine (G) on codon 614 is positively associated with a 0.49% (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.59) increase in Rt, which explains 61% of the Rt variation after accounting for the control measures. We remark that the modeling framework can be extended to study other infectious pathogens., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a link between the molecular-level mutation activity of SARS-CoV-2 and population-level transmission of COVID-19 to provide further evidence for a positive association between the D614G substitution and Rt.

Our study aims to describe the status of COVID-19 infection among people entering Shenzhen, and to evaluate the effect of the closed-loop management strategy., METHODS: We undertook a descriptive study and risk analysis by the entry time, time of reporting, and local confirmed cases in countries of origin. The NAT were completed in Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ten district-level CDCs, and fever clinics., RESULTS: A total of 86,844 people from overseas entered Shenzhen from January 1 to April 18, 2020; there were 39 imported COVID cases and 293 close contacts. The infection rate of people entering was 4.49 [95% Confidence interval (CI): 3.26-6.05]. Fourteen imported cases (35.9%) came from the UK, and nine (23.08%) came from the USA. People entering from the USA since March 9 or from the UK since March 13 are the high-risk population. As of July 17, there have been no new confirmed cases in Shenzhen for 153 days, and the numbers of confirmed case, close contacts, and asymptomatic cases are 0., CONCLUSIONS: The closed-loop management has been effective in preventing imported infection and controlling domestic relapse. The distribution of entry time and report time for imported cases overseas was similar. This shows that it is important to implement closed-loop management at the port of entry.",2021,/,BMC public health,21,1,551,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10548-8,33743630,#91350,Zou 2021,"",""

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) can be used as a bridging therapy to delay invasive mechanical ventilation or as a standalone therapy. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is rare and self-limiting, but there is an increased incidence documented in COVID-19.Here we document two cases of pneumomediastinum-related prolonged NIV therapy in severe COVID-19. Patient 1, a 64-year-old man, who developed symptoms after NIV therapy was weaned and survived. Patient 2, an 82-year-old woman, failed to improve despite NIV therapy, on investigation was found to have a pneumomediastinum. After review, the patient was placed on best supportive care and died 3 days later. We highlight the importance of recognising less common causes of deterioration in severe COVID-19 treated with NIV.

Melatonin may decrease risk for and aid treatment of COVID-19 and other RNA viral infections.,"DiNicolantonio, James J; McCarty, Mark; Barroso-Aranda, Jorge","A recent retrospective study has provided evidence that COVID-19 infection may be notably less common in those using supplemental melatonin. It is suggested that this phenomenon may reflect the fact that, via induction of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), melatonin can upregulate K63 polyubiquitination of the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, thereby boosting virally mediated induction of type 1 interferons. Moreover, Sirt1 may enhance the antiviral efficacy of type 1 interferons by preventing hyperacetylation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), enabling its retention in the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of interferon-inducible genes. This nuclear retention of HMGB1 may also be a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin therapy in COVID-19-complementing melatonin's suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activity and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. If these speculations are correct, a nutraceutical regimen including vitamin D, zinc and melatonin supplementation may have general utility for the prevention and treatment of RNA virus infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza.

Lessons from co-production of evidence and policy in Nigeria's COVID-19 response.,"Abubakar, Ibrahim; Dalglish, Sarah L; Ihekweazu, Chikwe A; Bolu, Omotayo; Aliyu, Sani H","In February 2020, Nigeria faced a potentially catastrophic COVID-19 outbreak due to multiple introductions, high population density in urban slums, prevalence of other infectious diseases and poor health infrastructure. As in other countries, Nigerian policymakers had to make rapid and consequential decisions with limited understanding of transmission dynamics and the efficacy of available control measures. We present an account of the Nigerian COVID-19 response based on co-production of evidence between political decision-makers, health policymakers and academics from Nigerian and foreign institutions, an approach that allowed a multidisciplinary group to collaborate on issues arising in real time. Key aspects of the process were the central role of policymakers in determining priority areas and the coordination of multiple, sometime conflicting inputs from stakeholders to write briefing papers and inform effective national decision making. However, the co-production approach met with some challenges, including limited transparency, bureaucratic obstacles and an overly epidemiological focus on numbers of cases and deaths, arguably to the detriment of addressing social and economic effects of response measures. Larger systemic obstacles included a complex multitiered health system, fragmented decision-making structures and limited funding for implementation. Going forward, Nigeria should strengthen the integration of the national response within existing health decision bodies and implement strategies to mitigate the social and economic impact, particularly on the poorest Nigerians. The co-production of evidence examining the broader public health impact, with synthesis by multidisciplinary teams, is essential to meeting the social and public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and other countries.

A practical approach for vaccinations including COVID-19 in autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases: a non-systematic review.,"Soy, Mehmet; Keser, Gokhan; Atagunduz, Pamir; Mutlu, Melek Yalcin; Gunduz, Alper; Koybasi, Gizem; Bes, Cemal","The COVID-19 pandemic has occupied the world agenda since December 2019. With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a ""Pubmed search"" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization. Key points * COVID-19 vaccinations should preferably be made during remission in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases. * Low-degree immunosuppression may not interfere with antibody response to vaccines. * Ideally, vaccinations should be made before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. * Timing of vaccination is especially important in the case of rituximab.",2021,/,Clinical rheumatology,,"8211469, di6",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05700-z,33751280,#91293,Soy 2021,"",""

The development of prognostic biomarkers and more importantly the implementation of new treatment modalities would have a significant impact in clinical practice regarding the outcome of MIS-C. Vitamin D could be a potential candidate. In this mini review we analyze the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in viral infections and specifically in COVID-19. We also examine the current literature regarding the association of vitamin D with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease. The vitamin D was evaluated not only as a biomarker but also as a nutritional supplement. We concluded that vitamin D levels could be valuable in predicting severe forms of MIS-C and correction of abnormal levels in severe MIS-C may influences its evolution. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] supplementation raising serum [25(OH)D] concentrations potentially have a favorable effect in reducing the severity of MIS-C in certain circumstances. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Predicting Lyme Disease From Patients' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Profiled With RNA-Sequencing.,"Clarke, Daniel J B; Rebman, Alison W; Bailey, Allison; Wojciechowicz, Megan L; Jenkins, Sherry L; Evangelista, John E; Danieletto, Matteo; Fan, Jinshui; Eshoo, Mark W; Mosel, Michael R; Robinson, William; Ramadoss, Nitya; Bobe, Jason; Soloski, Mark J; Aucott, John N; Ma'ayan, Avi","Although widely prevalent, Lyme disease is still under-diagnosed and misunderstood. Here we followed 73 acute Lyme disease patients and uninfected controls over a period of a year. At each visit, RNA-sequencing was applied to profile patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in addition to extensive clinical phenotyping. Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications. We show that Lyme patients can be distinguished from the controls as well as from COVID-19 patients, but classification was not successful in distinguishing those patients with early Lyme disease cases that would advance to develop post-treatment persistent symptoms.

Correlates of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths: a competing risks survival time analysis of retrospective mortality data.,"Goel, Ashish; Raizada, Alpana; Agrawal, Ananya; Bansal, Kamakshi; Uniyal, Saurabh; Prasad, Pratima; Yadav, Anil; Tyagi, Asha; Rautela, R S","INTRODUCTION: Several aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain ambiguous, including its transmission, severity, geographic and racial differences in mortality. These variations merit elaboration of local patterns to inform wider national policies., METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, data of patients treated at a dedicated COVID hospital with moderate and severe illness during eight weeks of the pandemic was reviewed with attention to mortality in a competing risks framework., RESULTS: A total of 1147 patients were hospitalized, and 312 (27.2%) died in hospital. Those who died were older (56.5 vs 47.6 years; p, < 0.0001). Of these, 885 (77.2%) had tested positive on RT-PCR, with 219 (24.2%) deaths (incidence rate, 1.9 per 100 person-days). Median time from onset of symptoms to death was 11 days. A competing risks analysis for in-hospital death revealed an adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio of 1.4 for each decade increase in age., CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis provides broad patterns of disease presentation and mortality. Even COVID test negative patients will receive treatment at dedicated facilities and 33% presenting cases may die within the first 72 hours, most with comorbid illness.

Pan-India novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genomics and global diversity analysis in spike protein.,"Alai, Shweta; Gujar, Nidhi; Joshi, Manali; Gautam, Manish; Gairola, Sunil","The mortality rates due to COVID-19 have been found disproportionate globally and are currently being researched. India mortality rate with a population of 1.3 billion people is relatively lowest to other countries with high infection rates. Genetic composition of circulating isolates continues to be a key determinant of virulence and pathogenesis. This study aimed to analyse the extent of divergence between genomes of Indian isolates (n=2525 as compared to reference Wuhan-1 strain and isolates from countries showing higher fatality rates including France, Italy, Belgium, and the USA. The study also analyses the impact of key mutations on interactions with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Using 1,44,605 spike protein sequences, global prevalence of mutations in spike protein was observed. The study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India share consensus with global trends with respect to D614G as most prevalent mutational event (81.66% among 2525 Indian isolates). Indian isolates did not reported prevalence of N439K mutation in receptor binding motif (RBM) as compared to global isolates (0.54%). Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of N439K mutation with respect to ACE 2 binding and reactivity with RBM targeted antibodies viz., B38, BD23, CB6, P2B-F26 and EY6A suggests that variant have relatively higher affinity with ACE 2 receptor which may support higher infectivity. The study warrants large scale monitoring of Indian isolates as SARS-CoV-2 virus is expected to evolve and mutations may appear in unpredictable way.

"Social Determinants of Health and Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Pregnancy: Condensation: Social determinants of health, including neighborhood characteristics such as household income and educational attainment, are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ","Prasannan, Lakha; Rochelson, Burton; Shan, Weiwei; Nicholson, Kaitlin; Solmonovich, Rachel; Kulkarni, Aparna; Lewis, Dawnette; Greenberg, Meir; Nimaroff, Michael; Blitz, Matthew J","BACKGROUND: The social and physical environments in which people live affect the emergence, prevalence and severity of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. There is limited data on how such social determinants of health (SDH), including neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, affect the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy., OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine how SDH are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 illness in hospitalized pregnant patients in New York during the global COVID-19 pandemic., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study evaluated all pregnant patients who delivered and had polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020 at seven hospitals within Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York. During the study period, universal SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols were implemented at all sites. PCR testing was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were excluded if the following variables were not available: PCR results, race, ethnicity, and/or ZIP code of residence. Clinical data were obtained from the enterprise electronic health record system. For each patient, ZIP code was used as a proxy for neighborhood. Socioeconomic characteristics were determined by linking to ZIP code data from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income (SOI) Division. Specific variables of interest included mean persons per household, median household income, percent unemployment, and percent with less than high school education. Medical records were manually reviewed for all subjects with positive PCR test results in order to correctly identify symptomatic patients and then classify those subjects using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) severity of illness categories. Classification was based on the highest severity of illness throughout gestation and not necessarily at the time of presentation for delivery., RESULTS: A total of 4,873 patients were included in the study. The PCR test positivity rate was 11% (n=544). Among this group, 359 patients (66%) were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, 115 (21%) had mild or moderate COVID-19, and 70 (13%) had severe or critical COVID-19. On multiple logistic regression modeling, pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be younger, of higher parity, belong to minoritized racial and ethnic groups, have public health insurance, have limited English proficiency, and/or reside in low-income neighborhoods with less educational attainment. On ordinal logit regression modeling, obesity, income, and education were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity., CONCLUSION: Social and physical determinants of health play a significant role in determining the risk of infection. Severity of COVID-19 illness was not associated with race or ethnicity but was associated with maternal obesity and neighborhood level characteristics such as educational attainment and household income.

The potential health and economic value of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alongside physical distancing in the UK: a transmission model-based future scenario analysis and economic evaluation.,"Sandmann, Frank G; Davies, Nicholas G; Vassall, Anna; Edmunds, W John; Jit, Mark; Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 working group","BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era., METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3.5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of 20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of 15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs x (monetary value per QALY) - costs., FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148.0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48.5-198.8) COVID-19 cases and 3.1 million (0.84-4.5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from 12.0 billion to 334.7 billion in the best-case scenario and from -1.1 billion to 56.9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large., INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research, European Commission, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations at work. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19., CONCLUSION: During the pandemic HCW demonstrated a lower burden of mental distress compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrates psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated.

An infection control surveillance-working group (ICS-WG) and infection control coordinators (ICCs) team were created to monitor the IPC practices of the healthcare workers (HCWs) in a regional hospital in Korea. This study analyzed the surveillance results and aimed to identify what IPC practices needed improvement., METHODS: During phase 1 (March to April 2020), the ICS-WG performed random audits, recorded incidences of improper IPC practices, and provided advice to the violators. During phase 2 (April to July), the ICCs inspected the hospital units and proposed practical ideas about IPC. The surveillance and proposals targeted the following practices: patient screening, usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand and respiratory hygiene, equipment reprocessing, environmental cleaning, management of medical waste, and social distancing., RESULTS: In phase 1, of the 127 violations observed, most (32.3%) corresponded to hand and respiratory hygiene. In phase 2, the highest proportion of violation per category was observed in the management of medical waste (37.8%); among these, a higher proportion of violation (71.4%) was observed in the collection of medical waste. Of the 106 proposals made by the ICCs, the most addressed practice was patient screening (28.3%). No case of nosocomial infection was reported during the study period., CONCLUSION: Adherence to proper hand and respiratory hygiene was inadequate at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that more attention and further training are needed for the management of medical waste, particularly medical waste collection, and that continuous upgrading of the strategies for patient screening is essential. These results will be useful in helping other healthcare facilities to establish their IPC strategies. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

This study drew on two nationally representative samples to compare the prevalence rate of anxiety in the U.S. before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020., RESULTS: The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined., LIMITATIONS: The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples., CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.

We measured participants' unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and quality of life., RESULTS: Half of our patient respondents reported unexpected changes to treatment following pandemic onset, with widespread confusion about their longer-term consequences. Although overall need levels have not increased, specific needs have changed in prominence. People with cancer reported significantly reduced anxiety (p = 0.049) and improved quality of life (p = 0.032) following pandemic onset, but support network participants reported reduced quality of life (p = 0.009), and non-significantly elevated anxiety, stress and depression., CONCLUSION: Psychological well-being of people with cancer has not been detrimentally affected by pandemic onset. Reliance on home-based support to compensate for the lost availability of structured healthcare pathways may, however, explain significant and detrimental effects on the well-being and quality of life of people in their support and informal care networks.

Nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne","AIMS: To examine the nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic., DESIGN: We followed the Cochrane criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis., DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, CINAHL and pre-print services (medRchiiv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates., REVIEW METHODS: We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high., RESULTS: Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19., CONCLUSION: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout., IMPACT: We found that burnout among nurses is a crucial issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prepare nurses to cope better with COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of risk factors for burnout could be a significant weapon giving nurses and health care systems the ability to response in a better way against the following COVID-19 waves in the near future.

Dissemination and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the early pandemic phase in South America.,"Wolf, Jonas Michel; Streck, Andre Felipe; Fonseca, Andre; Ikuta, Nilo; Simon, Daniel; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo","SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly and this scenario is concerning in South America, mainly in Brazil with more than seven million cases of infection. Three major pandemic lineages/clades could be identified along with SARS-CoV-2 dissemination (G, GR, and GH) in the Americas. These clades differ according to their genomic characteristics, virulence, and spreading times. The present study describes the main clades and the respective temporal spreading analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences (WGS) from South America, obtained in the early pandemic phase (from March 1 to May 31 in 2020). SARS-CoV-2 WGSs with available information from country and year of sampling were obtained from different countries and the main clades were identified and analyzed independently with a Bayesian approach. The results demonstrated the prevalence of clades GR (n=842; 54.6%), G (n=529; 34.3%), and GH (n=171; 11.1%). The frequencies of the clades were significantly different between South American countries. Clade G was the most prevalent in Ecuador, Suriname, and Uruguay, clade GR in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, and clade GH in Colombia. The phylodynamic analysis indicated that all these main lineages increased viral spreading from February to early March and after an evolutionary stationary phase was observed. The decrease observed in the virus dissemination was directly associated to the reduction of social movement after March. In conclusion, these data demonstrated the current predominance of clades G, GR, and GH in South America because of the early dissemination of them in the first pandemic phase in South America.

Secondary infections in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19: An overlooked matter?.,"Suarez-de-la-Rica, A; Serrano, P; De-la-Oliva, R; Sanchez-Diaz, P; Molinero, P; Falces-Romero, I; Ferrando, C; Rello, J; Maseda, E","OBJECTIVE: The susceptibility to infection probably increases in COVID-19 patients due to a combination of virusand drug-induced immunosuppression. The reported rate of secondary infections was quite low in previous studies. The objectives of our study were to investigate the rate of secondary infections, risk factors for secondary infections and risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients., METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study in mechanically ventilated critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Critical Care Unit (CCU). We recorded the patients' demographic data; clinical data; microbiology data and incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and nosocomial bacteremia (primary and secondary)., RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with a mean age 62.2 +/- 10.6 years were included. Incidence of secondary infection during CCU stay was 43.0% (46 patients), including nosocomial bacteremia (34 patients) and VAP (35 patients). Age was related to development of secondary infection (65.2 +/- 7.3 vs. 59.9 +/- 12.2 years, p=0.007). Age >= 65 years and secondary infection were independent predictors of mortality (OR=2.692, 95% CI 1.068-6.782, p<0.036; and OR=3.658, 95% CI 1.385- 9.660, p=0.009, respectively). The hazard ratio for death within 90 days in the >= 65 years group and in patients infected by antimicrobial resistant pathogens was 1.901 (95% CI 1.198- 3.018; p= 0.005 by log-rank test) and 1.787 (95% CI 1.023-3.122; p= 0.036 by log-rank test), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the incidence of secondary infection and infection by antimicrobial resistant pathogens is very high in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a significant impact on prognosis.

Research progress in laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2.,"Wang, Hao-Jia; Xiang, Yang-Hui; Hu, Rui; Ji, Rui; Wang, Yu-Ping","BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid testing is a reliable method for diagnosing viral infection in clinical samples. However, when the number of cases is huge and there are individual differences in the virus itself, the probability of false-negative results increases. With the advancement in research on the new coronavirus, new detection technologies that use serum-specific antibodies as detection targets have been developed. These detection technologies have high efficiency and shorter turnaround time, which ultimately shortens the time required for diagnosis. This article summarizes the methods that have been reported to date for the detection of the new coronavirus and discusses their principles and technical characteristics., AIMS: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and analyze their principles., METHODS: Searched reports on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods published so far, extracted the data and analyzed them. Use the primer blast function of NCBI to analyze the primers used in qRT-PCR detection., RESULTS: The detection sensitivity was the highest when nucleocapsid protein gene was used as the target, reaching 96.6%. The detection efficiency of the remaining targets ranged from 66.7% to 96.0%. Various new detection methods, like Serum specific antibody detection, can speed up the test time. However, due to the complexity of the method and higher testing requirements, it seems that it cannot be used as a complete replacement for qRT-PRC testing., CONCLUSIONS: With the advancement of technology and the improvement of methods, the detection methods of SARSCoV-2 have become more mature.

The need for oxygen therapy is an important factor determining hospital admission of these patients. Our retrospective study was designed to identify risk factors associated with the progression to oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. A total of 133 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital from February 22, 2020, to August 23. After excluding asymptomatic, non-Japanese, pediatric, pregnant patients and also those who needed oxygen immediately at admission, data of the remaining 84 patients were analyzed. The patients were separated into those who required oxygen after admission and those who did not, and their characteristics were compared. Age, body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified four significant and independent risk factors of oxygen requirement, including advanced age, obesity, glucose intolerance and lymphocytopenia. Dividing the patients into subgroups according to the number of these risk factors found in each patient indicated that the need for oxygen increased with higher number of these risk factors in the same individual.

As a critical component of a subunit vaccine, the adjuvant is responsible for strengthening the antigen-induced immune responses. Here, we present a new nanovaccine that comprising the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of spike protein and the manganese nanoadjuvant (MnARK), which induces humoral and cellular responses. Notably, even at a 5-fold lower antigen dose and with fewer injections, mice immunized with the MnARK vaccine immunized mice showed stronger neutralizing abilities against the infection of the pseudovirus (~270-fold) and live coronavirus (>8-fold) in vitro than that of Alum-adsorbed RBD vaccine (Alu-RBD). Furthermore, we found that the effective co-delivery of RBD antigen and MnARK to lymph nodes (LNs) elicited an increased cellular internalization and the activation of immune cells, including DC cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Our findings highlight the importance of MnARK adjuvant in the design of novel coronavirus vaccines and provide a rationale strategy to design protective vaccines through promoting cellular internalization and the activation of immune-related pathways.

However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings., Objectives: The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics., Methods: Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors., Results: With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01).

The Impact of Vitamin D Level on COVID-19 Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Teshome, Amare; Adane, Aynishet; Girma, Biruk; Mekonnen, Zeleke A","Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory and systemic disorder caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel Coronavirus (nCoV). To date, there is no proven curative treatment for this virus; as a result, prevention remains to be the best strategy to combat coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been proposed to play a role in coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, there is no conclusive evidence on its impact on COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the present review aimed to summarize the available evidence regarding the association between Vitamin D levels and the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic literature search of databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane/Wiley library, Scopus, and SciELO) were conducted from May 15, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Studies that assessed the effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19/SARS-2 infection were considered for the review. The qualities of the included studies were evaluated using the JBI tools. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was conducted and odds ratio with their 95%CI were reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Results: The electronic and supplementary searches for this review yielded 318 records from which, only 14 of them met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis indicated that vitamin D deficient individuals were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. The pooled analysis showed that individuals with Vitamin-D deficiency were 80% more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection as compared to those who have sufficient Vitamin D levels (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.72, 1.88). Begg's test also revealed that there was no significant publication bias between the studies (P = 0.764). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was relatively higher in the case-control study design (OR = 1.81). Conclusions: In conclusion, low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The limited currently available data suggest that sufficient Vitamin D level in serum is associated with a significantly decreased risk of COVID-19 infection.

However, little is known about the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity in virus-exposed individuals.

We also demonstrate the size and quality of the memory T-cell pool of COVID-19 patients are larger and better than those of close contacts. However, the proliferation capacity, size and quality of T-cell responses in close contacts are readily distinguishable from healthy donors, suggesting close contacts are able to gain T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 despite lacking a detectable infection.

When treatment is initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir has a strong dose effect, leading to reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlates with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. Antiviral efficacy is achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials. Notably, the highest dose of favipiravir tested is associated with signs of toxicity in animals.

The evolutionary dynamics of endemic human coronaviruses.,"Jo, Wendy K; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix","Community protective immunity can affect RNA virus evolution by selecting for new antigenic variants on the scale of years, exemplified by the need of annual evaluation of influenza vaccines. The extent to which this process termed antigenic drift affects coronaviruses remains unknown. Alike the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV) likely emerged from animal reservoirs as new human pathogens in the past. We therefore analyzed the long-term evolutionary dynamics of the ubiquitous HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in comparison with human influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H3N2. We focus on viral glycoprotein genes that mediate viral entry into cells and are major targets of host neutralizing antibody responses. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies of publicly available gene datasets representing about three decades of HCoV and IAV evolution showed that all viruses had similar ladder-like tree shapes compatible with antigenic drift, supported by different tree shape statistics. Evolutionary rates inferred in a Bayesian framework were 6.5 x 10-4 (95% highest posterior density (HPD), 5.4-7.5 x 10-4) substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for HCoV-229E spike (S) genes and 5.7 x 10-4 (95% HPD, 5-6.5 x 10-4) s/s/y for HCoV-OC43 S genes, which were about fourfold lower than the 2.5 x 10-3 (95% HPD, 2.3-2.7 x 10-3) s/s/y rate for IAV hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Coronavirus S genes accumulated about threefold less (P < 0.001) non-synonymous mutations (dN) over time than IAV HA genes. In both IAV and HCoV, the average rate of dN within the receptor binding domains (RBD) was about fivefold higher (P < 0.0001) than in other glycoprotein gene regions. Similarly, most sites showing evidence for positive selection occurred within the RBD (HCoV-229E, 6/14 sites, P < 0.05; HCoV-OC43, 23/38 sites, P < 0.01; IAV, 13/15 sites, P = 0.08). In sum, the evolutionary dynamics of HCoV and IAV showed several similarities, yet amino acid changes potentially representing antigenic drift occurred on a lower scale in endemic HCoV compared to IAV. It seems likely that pandemic SARS-CoV-2 evolution will bear similarities with IAV evolution including accumulation of adaptive changes in the RBD, requiring vaccines to be updated regularly, whereas higher SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary stability resembling endemic HCoV can be expected in the post-pandemic stage.

Risk of Clinically Relevant Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Gratz, Johannes; Wiegele, Marion; Maleczek, Mathias; Herkner, Harald; Schochl, Herbert; Chwala, Eva; Knobl, Paul; Schaden, Eva","Background: Early during the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reports suggested alarmingly high incidences for thromboembolic events in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, the clinical relevance of these events was not reported in several studies. Additionally, more recent research showed contradictory results and suggested substantially lower rates of venous thromboembolism. Thus, the aim of the present study was to summarize evidence on the incidence of clinically relevant venous thromboembolism (VTE)-defined as VTE excluding isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT)-in adult critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the incidence of clinically relevant PE and/or DVT in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Scientific reports published in the English language between January and October 2020 were included. We conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate incidence estimates of clinically relevant VTE and bleeding events. We also performed exploratory meta-regression and subgroup analyses of different diagnostic approaches and additional factors that possibly influenced the incidence of these outcomes. Results: Fifty-four articles (5,400 patients) fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria, of which 41 had a high risk of bias. The majority of included patients were male, > 60 years, and overweight. Twenty-one studies reported the use of prophylactic doses of heparin. Pooled incidences for clinically relevant PE were estimated at 8% (95% CI, 4-11%), for proximal DVT at 14% (95% CI, 9-20%), and-after exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias-for the composite outcome of VTE at 18% (95% CI, 13-24%). Clinically relevant bleeding occurred at a rate of 6% (95% CI, 2-9%). Conclusions: We summarized currently available data on the rate of clinically relevant VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Pooled incidence estimates were lower than those reported by previous review articles. In the absence of evidence-based anticoagulation guidelines for critically ill patients with COVID-19, the results of our study provide clinically important information for an individual risk-benefit assessment in this context.

While hundreds of reinfections have reported only a few have been confirmed. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the viral isolates from the different episodes is mandatory to establish reinfection. Methods: Nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP) and whole blood (WB) samples were collected from paired samples of four individuals who were suspected of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection based on distinct clinical episodes and RT-PCR tests. Details from their case record files and investigations were documented. RNA was extracted from the NP and OP samples and subjected to WGS, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were subjected to genome and protein-based functional annotation analyses. Serial serology was performed for Anti-N IgG, Anti- S1 RBD IgG, and sVNT (surrogate virus neutralizing test). Findings: Three patients were more symptomatic with lower Ct values and longer duration of illness. Seroconversion was detected soon after the second episode in three patients. WGS generated a genome coverage ranging from 80.07 to 99.7%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed sequences belonged to G, GR and ""Other"" clades. A total of 42mutations were identified in all the samples, consisting of 22 non-synonymous, 17 synonymous, two in upstream, and one in downstream regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Comparative genomic and protein-based annotation analyses revealed differences in the presence and absence of specific mutations in the virus sequences from the two episodes in all four paired samples. Interpretation: Based on the criteria of genome variations identified by whole genome sequencing and supported by clinical presentation, molecular and serological tests, we were able to confirm reinfections in two patients, provide weak evidence of reinfection in the third patient and unable to rule out a prolonged infection in the fourth. This study emphasizes the importance of detailed analyses of clinical and serological information as well as the virus's genomic variations while assessing cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

We generate a linear epitope landscape of the Spike protein by analyzing the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response of 1,051 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions rich in linear epitopes, i.e., C-terminal domain (CTD) and a region close to the S2' cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find that the receptor binding domain (RBD) lacks linear epitope. We reveal that the number of responsive peptides is highly variable among patients and correlates with disease severity. Some peptides are moderately associated with severity and clinical outcome. By immunizing mice, we obtain linear-epitope-specific antibodies; however, no significant neutralizing activity against the authentic virus is observed for these antibodies.

Or, as a rule of thumb, each infected student would generate (just less than) one secondary within-household infection. The total number of secondary cases for all returning students is dependent on the virus prevalence within each student population at the time of their departure from campus back home. Although the proposed estimation method is general and robust, the results are sensitive to the input data.

Among the factors, the density and particle size have negligible effects on particle trajectory, while the vertical coordinates of particles increase with the rise in heating source temperature. When the heating temperature is higher than 355 K , all of the particles exit the channel from one outlet; thus, the collecting and accumulating of virus-laden aerosols can be realized.

Smoking Is Correlated With the Prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients: An Observational Study.,"Peng, Fei; Lei, Si; Zhang, Quan; Zhong, Yanjun; Wu, Shangjie","Background: Cigarette smoking has been proven to be a risk factor in the development of many diseases. However, it remains controversial with respect to the relationship of smoking with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of smoking in COVID-19., Methods: A total of 622 patients with COVID-19 in China were enrolled in the study. Corresponding clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were employed to analyze the association of smoking with survival in patients with COVID-19., Results: Smoking was statistically significant comparing non-survivors and survivors of patients with COVID-19 (P = 0.007). Males had higher proportion of smoking than females (91.9% vs. 8.1%, P < 0.001). Compared with the non-smoker, there was significant statistical difference in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in smoking patients with COVID-19 (9.7% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.017). White blood cell count (6.3 vs. 5.4; P = 0.037), hemoglobin level (139.0 vs. 127.0; P < 0.001), and creatinine level (77.3 vs. 61.0; P < 0.001) were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients who smoked. Moreover, smoking patients showed a worse survival compared with non-smoking patients (Log Rank P = 0.045).

While there is strong support for testing symptomatic patients. The benefit of routine testing of asymptomatic patients remains contentious. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in cancer patients., METHODS: Between June 1 and September 3, 2020, we obtained nasopharyngeal swab from asymptomatic cancer patients who were visiting a single tertiary-care cancer center, and tested the specimen for the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We performed a descriptive statistic of data RESULTS: We tested a total of 80 patients, of which 3 (3.75%) were found positive for COVID-19. A significant proportion of the tested patients were on active immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, cytotoxic chemotherapy (n=34), and immunotherapy (n=16). However, all three COVID-19 positive patients were only actively on hormonal therapy. All three patients observed a minimum of 2 weeks home quarantine. None of the patients developed symptoms upon follow up and no changes were required to their treatment plan., CONCLUSIONS: Despite published evidence that cancer patients may be at increased risk of severe COVID -19 infection, our data suggest that some infected cancer patients are asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in this population of cancer patients was similar to that in the general population. Therefore, since asymptomatic infections are not uncommon in patients with cancer, we recommend universal COVID-19 testing to help guide treatment decisions and prevent the spread of the disease.

We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed., RESULTS: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or non-containment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %)., CONCLUSION: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups. The findings should instil confidence among blood donors and motivate them to donate blood without fear. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely., METHODS: This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19., FINDINGS: Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired., IMPLICATIONS: Medical management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia presents a reasonable alternative for parathyroid surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak and should be instituted until the pandemic ends and surgery can be performed safely.

Iran was one of those first countries facing the second wave of coronavirus, due to the lack of appropriate public restrictions because of economic problems the country is facing. The clinical and demographic characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in 192 patients in Tehran, Iran, between June 16 and July 11, 2020, were investigated. The patients were divided into severe cases (n = 82) and non-severe cases (n = 110). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study clusters. The mean age was 54.6 +/- 17.2 years, and the most common presenting symptom was persistent cough (81.8%) and fever (79.7%). The logistic regression model revealed that age, BMI, and affected family members were statistically associated with severity. Patients with complicated conditions of disorders faced more hospitalization days and medical care than the average statistical data. As the coronavirus spike in the case and death reports from June 2020, we observed the rise in the incidence of severe cases, where 42.7% (82/192) of cases have resulted in severe conditions. Our findings also suggested that the effect of IFB (Betamethasone) was more valid than the other alternative drugs such as LPV/r and IVIg.",2021,/,PloS one,16,3,e0246314,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246314,33739987,#91336,ZaferaniArani 2021,"",""
COVID-19 and male fertility: Taking stock of one year after the outbreak began.,"Delle Fave, Rocco Francesco; Polisini, Giordano; Giglioni, Gianluca; Parlavecchio, Arnaldo; Dell'Atti, Lucio; Galosi, Andrea Benedetto","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to summarize, following a timeline, the current knowledge regarding the effects of the Sars-cov2 virus on male fertility, researching the pathological and clinical results of the studies published in the last year., METHODS: A systematic research was performed on the major international online databases; Thirty-five articles were selected., RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in testosterone levels and sperm quality in subjects with COVID-19 has been highlighted in several papers; however, in many cases the tests have been conducted in patients with active disease and long-term consequences are still not known. Some studies have confirmed the presence of the virus in the testis in a low percentage of patients; viral presence in sperm has only been found in one study. Testicular discomfort, which could indicate viral orchitis, was highlighted in several works, with an incidence of up to 19% percent of patients. The presence of inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates, IgG and inflammatory cytokines have been documented in several works; pathological signs of inflammation were found in 60.9% of testicular biopsies performed in one study. The entry of the virus into the testis cells, both stromal and seminal cells appeared to be Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) mediated, as it also occurs in other tissues. DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, autoantibody production and ACE2 mediated effect have all been hypothesized as cause of cellular damage., CONCLUSIONS: The results on effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are currently insufficient as they are based on a small number of patients and therefore are often contradictory.Certain mechanisms of testicular damage are still to be assessed, as any risk categories like age, ethnicity, or others.

Effects of COVID-19 on male sex function and its potential sexual transmission.,"Rodriguez Bustos, Hector; Bravo Maturana, Gonzalo; Cortes-Chau, Felipe; Defaur Torres, Joelle; Cortes-Pino, Felipe; Aguirre, Pablo; Arriaza Onel, Camilo","INTRODUCTION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 8, 2020 and was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 uses the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry route, associated with the transmembrane serine protease protein (TMPRSS2), which makes the testis and particularly spermatogenesis potentially vulnerable, since this tissue has high expression of ACE2., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review by electronic bibliographic databases in Pubmed, Scopus and ScienceDirect up to August 2020 about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on male sexual function and its transmission, to assess possible repercussions on sex organs and the existence of a sexual transmission path., RESULTS: Although SARS-CoV-2 presence has not been found in testicle samples, it has been demonstrated that it causes histological changes compatible with orchitis, and sex hormone disturbances. TMPRSS2 is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression, thus these patients may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. No viral material has been found in blood or semen, however it has been proven to be present in stool and saliva., CONCLUSION: The male reproductive system would be highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in somatic and germ cells. The seminal fluid would remain free of viral presence in patients with COVID-19. Regardless, non-genital sex could be an important source of viral transmission. In assisted reproduction techniques all necessary tests must be carried out to ensure the donor is free of the virus at the time of collection and handling of the seminal sample.",2021,/,"Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",93,1,48-52,,https://dx.doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2021.1.48,33754609,#91334,RodriguezBustos 2021,"",""

Who is at a Higher Risk? A brief review of Recent Evidence on comorbidities in children infected with COVID-19.,"Qamar, Mohammad Aadil; Sajid, Mir Ibrahim; Dhillon, Rubaid Azhar; Irfan, Omar; Abaidullah, Sajid","Background: COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity. Children can present with mild symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, and rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation. This population includes children who are younger than one year and older adolescents who have an underlying comorbidity-specifically immunosuppression or prior cardio-respiratory infections. In this review, we discuss the determinants of severe disease among the paediatric patients- primarily asthma, immune-status, obesity and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Asthma and underlying lung pathologies can be a strong predictor (~20% prevalence) for development of severe COVID-19 infection, irrespective of age. However, as compared to asthma, a higher mortality rate was reported in immune-compromised patients. With a weakened immune system, immunosuppressed individuals were 1.55 times and immunocompromised patients 3.29 times more vulnerable to developing severer COVID-19 disease. Similarly, evidence suggests that a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 renders individuals more susceptible to developing COVID-19-related complications. This observation is based on the negative impacts obesity has on pulmonary functions and in downplaying the immune system. Furthermore, a possible association of COVID-19 and MIS-C has been reported by multiple studies across the globe but it needs further studies to strengthen its stance due to the scarcity of data when compared with the other determinants discussed in this article. Authors recommend researchers directing attention on synthesizing the evolving evidence to fill the knowledge void in the paediatric population, which will better enable paediatricians to make informed decisions.",2020,/,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",32(Suppl 1),4,S695-S700,,,33754534,#91332,Qamar 2020,"",""

Inhalable nanovaccine with biomimetic coronavirus structure to trigger mucosal immunity of respiratory tract against COVID-19.,"Zheng, Bin; Peng, Wenchang; Guo, Mingming; Huang, Mengqian; Gu, Yuxuan; Wang, Tao; Ni, Guangjian; Ming, Dong","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 seriously threatens global public health. It has previously been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted between people through ""respiratory droplets"". Therefore, the respiratory tract mucosa is the first barrier to prevent virus invasion. It is very important to stimulate mucosal immunity to protect the body from respiratory virus infection. Inspired by this, we designed a bionic-virus nanovaccine, which can induce mucosal immunity by nasal delivery to prevent virus infection from respiratory tract. The nanovaccine that mimic virosome is composed of poly(I:C) mimicking viral genetic material as immune adjuvant, biomimetic pulmonary surfactant (bio-PS) liposomes as capsid structure of virus and the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 as ""spike"" to completely simulate the structure of the coronavirus. The nanovaccine can be administered by inhaling to imitate the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the respiratory tract. Our results demonstrated that the inhalable nanovaccine with bionic virus-like structure has a stronger mucosal protective effect than routine muscle and subcutaneous inoculation. In particular, high titer of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) was detected in respiratory secretions, which effectively neutralize the virus and prevent it from entering the body through the respiratory tract. Through imitating the structure and route of infection, this inhalable nanovaccine strategy might inspire a new approach to the precaution of respiratory viruses. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, case reports also suggested that rare, repeated infections may occur as soon as 48 days following initial disease onset. The underlying immunologic deficiencies enabling SARS-CoV-2 reinfections are currently unknown. Here we describe a renal transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection - confirmed by whole virus genome sequencing - 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses. The patient’s immune system was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we also identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and the formation of humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation in this patient. In summary, our study suggests that a low neutralizing antibody presence alone is not sufficient to confer resistance against reinfection. Thus, patients with solid organ transplantation, or patients who are otherwise immunosuppressed, who recover from infection with SARS-CoV-2 may not develop sufficient protective immunity and are at risk of reinfection.",2021,,,,,,PPR303201,10.1101/2021.03.24.21253992,,#93076,Klein 2021,"",""

In this review, we elaborate on various COVID-19 diagnostic tools that are available or under investigation. Consequently, cell culture, followed by an indirect fluorescent antibody, is one of the most accurate methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities prevented its general use and implementation. Diagnosis via radiologic imaging and reverse transcriptase PCR assay is frequently employed, considered as standard procedures, whereas isothermal amplification methods are currently on the verge of clinical introduction. Notably, techniques such as CRISPR-Cas and microfluidics have added new dimensions to the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Furthermore, commonly used immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), neutralization assay, and the chemiluminescent assay can also be used for early detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Very little is known about the impact of these restrictions on trauma centers. Our objective was to determine the effect of the pandemic-associated lockdown on trauma admissions, patient's demographics, mechanisms of injury, injury severity, and outcomes in the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital., METHODS: An IRB-approved quasi-experimental study was performed to assess the impact of the restrictions by comparing trauma admissions during the lockdown (March 15, 2020 - June 15, 2020) with a control period (same period in 2017-2019). Comparisons were done using the Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. A negative binomial model was fitted to estimate the incidence rate ratio for overall admissions among pre-lockdown and during-lockdown periods. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05., RESULTS: A total of 308 subjects were admitted during the quarter of study for 2017; 323, for 2018; 347, for 2019; and 150, for 2020. The median (interquartile range) age of patients rose significantly from 40 (33) years to 49 (30) years (p < 0.001) for the lockdown period compared to the historical period. Almost all mechanisms of injury (i.e., motor vehicle accident, assault, pedestrian, burn, suicide attempt, other) had a slight non-significant reduction in the percentage of patients presenting with an injury. Instead, falls experienced an increase during the lockdown period (18.9% vs. 26.7%; p = 0.026). Moreover, the proportion of severe cases decreased, as measured by an injury severity score (ISS) > 15 (37.3% vs. 26.8%; p = 0.014); while there were no differences in the median hospital length of stay and the mortality rate between the comparison groups. Finally, the decrease in overall admissions registered during the lockdown accounts for a 59% (IRR 0.41; 95% CI 0.31-0.54) change compared to the pre-lockdown period, when controlling for sex, age, mechanism of injury, and ISS., CONCLUSIONS: Following periods of social isolation and curfews, trauma centers can expect drastic reductions in their overall patient volume with associated changes in trauma patterns.

The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts.",2021,,,,,,PPR303917,10.1101/2021.03.23.21253460,,#93115,Chaudhury 2021,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 Acquisition and Immune Pathogenesis Among School-Aged Learners in Four K-12 Schools,"Cooper, Dan; Messaoudi, ilhem; Aizik, Shlomit; Camplain, Ricky; Lopez, Nanette; Ardo, Jessica; Boden-Albala, Bernadette; Chau, Clayton; Condon, Curt; Golden, Charles; Coimbra Ibraim, Izabela; Jankeel, Allen; Kasper, Kirsten; Meyer, Andria; Stehli, Annamarie; Stephens, Diana; Weiss, Michael; Zulu, Michael; Ulloa, Erlinda","<h4>Objectives: </h4> To directly measure SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse schools with either remote or onsite learning. Methods. 4 schools participated. Schools A and B served low-income Hispanic learners, school C special needs, and all three provided predominantly remote instruction. School D served middle and upper-middle income, White learners, with predominantly onsite instruction. 320 learners [10.5+/-2.1(SD); 7-17 y.o.]; 86% had phlebotomy. Testing occurred early in the fall (2020), at lower levels of COVID-19, and 6-8 weeks later during the fall-winter surge (tenfold increase in COVID-19 cases). <h4>Results:</h4> Nasal RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 respiratory pathogens was performed. Phlebotomy was obtained for circulating immunity. Face covering and physical distancing fidelity was measured by direct observation. 17 learners were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the surge. School A (97% remote) had the highest infection rate (9/70, 12.9%, p<0.01) and IgG positivity rate (13/70, 18.6%). School D had the lowest infection and IgG positive rate (1/86, 1.2%). Mitigation compliance [physical distancing (mean 87.4%) and face covering (91.3%)] was high at all schools. Learners with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection had neutralizing antibodies (94.7%), broad and robust interferon-gamma T cell responses, reduced frequencies of monocytes, and lower levels of circulating inflammatory mediators. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Infection in the schools reflected regional rates rather than remote or onsite learning modalities. Schools can implement successful mitigation strategies across a wide range of income, school-type, and student diversity. Reduced monocyte and immune mediator concentrations coupled with robust humoral and cellular immunity may explain the generally milder symptoms in school-aged children.",2021,,,,,,PPR303334,10.1101/2021.03.20.21254035,,#93100,Cooper 2021,"",""

Few studies measured the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), calcium and magnesium in COVID-19. Aims: To measure sRAGE, ACE2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, CRP, calcium, magnesium, and albumin in COVID-19 patients in association with peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and chest CT scan abnormalities (CCTA) including ground glass opacities. Methods. This study measured sRAGE, ACE2, IL-6, IL-10, CRP using ELISA techniques, and calcium, magnesium, and albumin using a spectrophotometric method in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls. Results. COVID-19 is characterized by significantly increased IL-6, CRP, IL-10, sRAGE, ACE2, and lowered levels of SpO2, albumin, magnesium and calcium. Neural networks showed that a combination of calcium, IL-6, CRP, and sRAGE yielded an accuracy of 100% in detecting COVID-19 patients with calcium being the most important predictor followed by IL-6, and CRP. COVID-19 patients with CCTAs showed lower SpO2 and albumin levels than those without CCTAs. SpO2 was significantly and inversely correlated with IL-6, IL-10, CRP, sRAGE, and ACE2, and positively with albumin, magnesium and calcium. Patients with positive IgG results showed a significant elevation in the serum level of IL-6, sRAGE, and ACE2 compared to the negatively IgG patient subgroup. Conclusion. The results show that immune-inflammatory and RAGE pathway biomarkers may be used as external validating criterion for the diagnosis COVID-19. Those pathways coupled with lowered SpO2, calcium and magnesium are drug targets that may help to reduce the consequences of COVID-19.",2021,,,,,,PPR303160,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254383,,#93073,Al-Hakeim 2021,"",""

Furthermore, though some previous studies have investigated the association of demographic factors such as race with SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, fewer have correlated exposure risk to surrogates for socioeconomic status such as health insurance coverage. Methods We used a highly specific serological assay utilizing the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in remnant blood samples collected by the University of North Carolina Health system. We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort with Bayesian regression, as well as the association of critical demographic factors with higher prevalence odds. Findings Between April 21st and October 3rd of 2020, a total of 9,624 unique samples were collected from clinical sites in central NC and we observed a seroprevalence increase from 2.9 (1.7, 4.3) to 9.1 (7.2, 11.1) over the study period. Individuals who identified as Latinx were associated with the highest odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 exposure at 7.77 overall (5.20, 12.10). Increased odds were also observed among Black individuals and individuals without public or private health insurance. Interpretation Our data suggests that for this care-accessing cohort, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was significantly higher than cumulative total cases reported for the study geographical area six months into the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. The increased odds of seropositivity by ethnoracial grouping as well as health insurance highlights the urgent and ongoing need to address underlying health and social disparities in these populations.",2021,,,,,,PPR303156,10.1101/2021.03.25.21254320,,#93072,Lopez 2021,"",""

Current rapid antigen tests cannot quantitate and track antigen dynamics with high sensitivity and specificity in respiratory samples. <h4>Methods</h4> We developed and validated an ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with smartphone readout using the Microbubbling Digital Assay previously developed by our group, which is a platform that enables highly sensitive detection and quantitation of protein biomarkers. A computer vision-based algorithm was developed for microbubble smartphone image recognition and quantitation. A machine learning-based classifier was developed to classify the smartphone images based on detected microbubbles. Using this assay, we tracked antigen dynamics in serial swab samples from COVID patients hospitalized in ICU and immunocompromised COVID patients. <h4>Results</h4> The limit of detection (LOD) of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM) recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, comparable to many rRT-PCR methods. The assay had high analytical specificity towards SARS-CoV-2. Compared to EUA-approved rRT-PCR methods, the Microbubbling Antigen Assay demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92-99%) in symptomatic individuals within 7 days of symptom onset and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with negative nucleic acid results. Antigen positivity rate in NP swabs gradually decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic acid positivity of the same samples. The computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble image classifier could accurately identify positives and negatives, based on microbubble counts and sizes. Total microbubble volume, a potential marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Antigen was detected for longer periods of time in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, compared to immunocompetent individuals. Simultaneous detectable antigens and nucleic acids may indicate the presence of replicating viruses in patients with persistent infections. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay enables sensitive and specific detection of acute infections, and quantitation and tracking of antigen dynamics in different patient populations at various stages of infection. With smartphone compatibility and automated image processing, the assay is well-positioned to be adapted for point-of-care diagnosis and to explore the clinical implications of antigen dynamics in future studies.",2021,,,,,,PPR303328,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253847,,#93099,Chen 2021,"",""
Emergence of N antigen SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants escaping detection of antigenic tests,"Del Vecchio, Claudia; Brancaccio, Giuseppina; Brazzale, Alessandra Rosalba; Lavezzo, Enrico; Onelia, Francesco; Franchin, Elisa; Manuto, Laura; Bianca, Federico; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Annamaria; Toppo, Stefano; Crisanti, Andrea","SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging as a major threat to vaccination efforts worldwide as they may increase virus transmission rate and/or confer the ability to escape vaccine induced immunity with knock on effects on the level of herd immunity and vaccine efficacy respectively. These variants concern the Spike protein, which is encoded by the S gene, involved in virus entry into host cells and the major target of vaccine development. We report here that genetic variants of the N gene can impair our ability to utilize antigenic tests for both diagnosis and mass testing efforts aimed at controlling virus transmission. While conducting a large validation study on the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag test, we noticed that some swab samples failed to generate a positive result in spite of a high viral load in Rt-PCR assays. Sequencing analysis of viruses showing discordant results in the Rt-PCR and antigen assays revealed the presence of multiple disruptive amino-acid substitutions in the N antigen (the viral protein detected in the antigen test) clustered from position 229 to 374 a region known to contain an immunodominant epitope. A relevant fraction of the variants, undetected by the antigen test, contained the mutations A376T coupled to M241I. Intriguingly we found that virus sequences with this mutation were over-represented in the antigen-test-negative and PCR-positive samples and progressively increased in frequency over time in Veneto, a region of Italy that has aggressively scaled up the utilization of antigen tests, which reached nearly 68% of all the SARS-CoV-2 swab assays performed there. We speculate that mass utilization of antigen assays could create a selection pressure on the target that may favor the spread of undetectable virus variants.",2021,,,,,,PPR303145,10.1101/2021.03.25.21253802,,#93071,DelVecchio 2021,"",""

"Shielding, use of face mask and hand hygiene: Could this be the answer to winter pressures?",Avoseh M.; Messer B.; Armstrong A.; Colt J.; Smith P.; Sovani M. ,"Background: Shielding for clinically vulnerable members of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on healthcare delivery. This study investigates whether shielding reduces hospital admissions amongst patients requiring long term ventilation (LTV) and whether there may be a role for shielding and adopting other hygiene methods every winter to reduce hospital admissions. Method(s): 603 LTV patients in two large centres completed a questionnaire about shielding and COVID-19 symptoms during the lockdown. A comparative retrospective study of hospital admissions for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) between the periods March-June 2019 and March - June 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also carried out. Result(s): 522(88.57%) of the 603 patients reported observing strict adherence to shielding whilst the remaining 81(13.43%) observed isolation precautions to various degrees. 30 (4.98%) reported having developed COVID-19 symptoms with just 2 (0.33%) testing positive but none required invasive ventilation and there were no deaths. Admissions requiring acute NIV in 2019 was 39(6.47%) compared to 9(1.49%) during the 2020 COVID19 peak. Conclusion(s): Compared to 2019, there was a drop in the number of admissions in patients requiring acute NIV during lock-down. COVID 19 incidence was also low in this shielded cohort. These suggest a case can be made for advocating shielding every winter for LTV patients and potentially for all patients with chronic respiratory disease. Widespread use of masks and improved hand hygiene could also help reduce spread of other viral illnesses like influenza which account for a significant number of admissions in (Figure presented) patients with chronic respiratory conditions over the winter months. Adopting a blanket strategy to shield all patients with chronic respiratory illness during winter is probably impractical. A stratify-and-shield policy requiring an adaptive social distancing strategy to keep the load on critical care services within manageable limits1 has been advocated. We anticipate our findings will generate exciting debate for and against shielding our most clinically vulnerable respiratory patients during winter.",2021,/,Thorax,76,SUPPL 1,A105,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2020-BTSabstracts.182,634543528,#92153,Avoseh 2021,"",""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they also keep the pressure off hospitals. PHCPs are assumed to be at high risk of a COVID-19 infection, as they are exposed to a large portion of the population (usually with less personal protective equipment than other frontline health care workers(HCWs)). Nevertheless, previous seroprevalence studies focussed on the general population or HCWs in hospital settings, rather than PHCPs. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PHCPs after the first and during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave in Flanders (Belgium) and compare it to the seroprevalence in the general population (blood donors). A prospective cohort of PHCPs, mainly GPs (n=698) was screened for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at five different time-points (June-December 2020). The dried blood spots they produced were analysed using a Luminex multiplex immunoassay. The seroprevalence of PHCPs remained stable between June and September 2020 (4.6-5.0%), but increased significantly from October to December (8.1-13.4%) 2020. The seroprevalence of PHCPs was not significantly higher than the seroprevalence of the blood donors at the end of December 2020. In conclusion, the sharp increase in seroprevalence during the second COVID-19 wave in Flanders shows that PHCPs were more at risk during the second wave compared to the first one. However, the increase was in line with the general population suggesting that PHCPs mainly got infected in their private settings.",2021,,,,,,PPR303142,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254327,,#93069,Marien 2021,"",""

The rarity of these case poses therapeutic dilemmas about their further management., Presentation of case: A 61 year old gentleman who had covid19 infection 2 months back, presented with new onset myasthenia gravis and an anterior mediastinal mass. He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma., Discussion: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach., Conclusion: This is the first documented case of post covid19 infection thymomatous myasthenia gravis to the best of our knowledge, managed with minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery.

Recently, low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with higher risks for contracting COVID-19. South Asians in the UK have higher risk for low vitamin D levels. In this study, we assessed vitamin D status of British-Bangladeshi migrants compared with white British residents and Bangladeshis still living in Bangladesh ('sedentees')., Methodology: The cross-sectional study compared serum vitamin D levels among 149 women aged 35-59, comprising British-Bangladeshi migrants (n = 50), white British neighbors (n = 54) and Bangladeshi sedentees (n = 45). Analyses comprised multivariate models to assess serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and associations with anthropometric, lifestyle, health and migration factors., Results: Vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants were very low: mean 25(OH)D = 32.2 nmol/L +/- 13.0, with 29% of migrants classified as deficient (<25 nmol/L) and 94% deficient or insufficient (<=50 nmol/L). Mean levels of vitamin D were significantly lower among British-Bangladeshis compared with Bangladeshi sedentees (50.9 nmol/L +/- 13.3, P < 0.001) and were also lower than in white British women (55.3 nmol/L +/- 20.9). Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with increased body mass index and low iron status., Conclusions and implications: We conclude that lower exposure to sunlight in the UK reduces vitamin D levels in Bangladeshi migrants. Recommending supplements could prevent potentially adverse health outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency., Lay Summary: Vitamin D deficiency is one example of mismatch between an evolved trait and novel environments.

Is COVID-19 an Independent Risk Factor for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia?.,"Madala, Samragnyi; Krzyzak, Michael; Dehghani, Shabnam","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a viral respiratory illness initially described in Wuhan, China, and was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020, and the disease is named coronavirus disease (COVID-19). SARS-CoV2 is known to cause fever, cough, fatigue, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As more patients become infected, extrapulmonary manifestations came to rise and hypercoagulability is one among those. COVID-19 could predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolic events which are commonly treated with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The treatment of patients who develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) while being treated with heparin or LMWH for COVID-induced thromboembolic complications is challenging. We describe a patient admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, found to have a cerebrovascular event treated with unfractionated heparin. She also received therapeutic LMWH for anticoagulation on day 1 of presentation due to atrial fibrillation. She was diagnosed with HIT and was found to have a pulmonary embolism, aortic arch mural thrombus, and arterial thrombi in the lower extremities. As more recent studies showed HIT antibodies in COVID-19 patients who are naive for heparin-based products, COVID-19 may be an independent risk factor for the development of HIT. The role of COVID-19 in the development of HIT is uncertain. High vigilance is required to diagnose and initiate treatment for HIT early in the disease course as it can be life-threatening.

CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (50%) and hazy increased opacities (37%). Typical CT features are bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO). Indeed GGO were present in 100% of our patients. Consolidations were visible in 76% of our study population. Notably both GGO and consolidations had a peripheral distribution in all our patients. Other CT imaging features included crazy-paving pattern, fibrous stripes, subpleural lines, architectural distortion, air bronchogram sign, vascular thickening and nodules. Our literature review identified thirty original studies supporting our imaging chest findings., Conclusions: At admission, COVID-19 pneumonia can manifest in chest imaging as B-lines and consolidations on US, hazy opacities and consolidations on CXR, multiple GGO and consolidations on CT scan.

Impact of chemotherapy on lymphocytes and serological memory in recovered COVID-19 patients with acute leukemia.,"Liu, Wei; Li, Ziping; He, Wenjuan; Yu, Dan; Wang, Ping; Cai, Li; Yang, Peng; Chen, Xuexing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhou, Hao","Chemotherapy is the major method of treatment for acute leukemia to date, while intensive chemotherapy may impair immunity. We previously reported that leukemia patients were more susceptible to COVID-19 than the overall population. However, for COVID-19 recovered patients with leukemia, the impacts of intensive chemotherapy on the immune memory of COVID-19 are unknown. This study characterized the changes in immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in acute leukemia patients, who underwent chemotherapy after recovering from COVID-19. The study enrolled three groups of individuals. One group was a total of three acute leukemia patients, who recovered well from COVID-19 before the last cycle of chemotherapy. The other two groups were six COVID-19 recovered healthy people, and six normal uninfected healthy people, respectively. Levels of B cells, T cells, and NK cells in peripheral blood were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were monitored. The results showed that B cells were severely decreased after chemotherapy, especially memory B cells. Most of the T cells and NK cells showed only minor changes after chemotherapy, except for gammadelta T cells. The serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not significantly affected after chemotherapy in two leukemia patients. However, interestingly, one leukemia patient's SARS-CoV-2 IgM showed dramatically increase, suggesting possible loss of serological memory after chemotherapy. These findings raised the concern for the stability of immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 during chemotherapy and the choice of anti-leukemia treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 triggered a wide range of psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. However, studies on mental health status in developing countries including Ethiopia related to COVID-19 are very limited. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the magnitude of depression, anxiety, and stress, and their associated factors among Gondar town population during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic., Patients and Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 660 residents of Gondar town in April 2020. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select study participants. A 21 item depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was used. Variables with a p-value <0.05 in the final model were declared as statistically significant. Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test was used to check the model fitness., Results: In this study, the prevalence of depression was 32.0% (95% CI: 28.4-35.5), anxiety 25.8% (95% CI: 22.4-29.1), and stress 14.7% (95% CI: 12.0-17.4), respectively. The odds of developing depression was higher among female respondents (AOR=2.30, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.83) and ever smokers (AOR=2.8, 95 CI: 1.23, 6.28) as compared to their counterparts. Besides, history of medical illness and ever smoking increase the odds of anxiety by 2.3 (AOR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.42-3.76), and 2.8 (AOR=2.8; 95% CI: 1.23-3.83), respectively. Furthermore, being unemployed and family size of <5 increase the odds of stress by 2.1 (AOR=2.1; 95% CI: 1.17-3.83) and 1.8 (AOR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.09-2.81), respectively., Conclusion: In this study, the overall depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly high. There are number of factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.

"Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) as a biomarker of COVID-19 disease severity and indicator of the need for mechanical ventilation, ARDS and mortality.","Lim, Adeline; Radujkovic, Aleksandar; Weigand, Markus A; Merle, Uta","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pneumonia and subsequent respiratory failure is causing an immense strain on intensive care units globally. Early prediction of severe disease enables clinicians to avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development and improve management of critically ill patients. The soluble receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (sRAGE) is a biomarker shown to predict ARDS. Although sRAGE level varies depending on the type of disease, there is limited information available on changes in sRAGE levels in COVID-19. Therefore, sRAGE was measured in COVID-19 patients to determine sRAGE level variation in COVID-19 severity and to examine its ability to predict the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality in COVID-19., METHODS: In this single-centre observational cohort study in Germany, serum sRAGE during acute COVID-19, 20 weeks after the start of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as in control groups of non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and healthy controls were measured using ELISA. The primary endpoint was severe disease (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO)/MV and need of organ support). The secondary endpoints were respiratory failure with need of MV and 30-day mortality. The area under the curve (AUC), cut-off based on Youden's index and odds ratio with 95% CI for sRAGE were calculated with regard to prediction of MV need and mortality., RESULTS: Serum sRAGE in 164 COVID-19 patients, 101 matched COVID-19 convalescent patients, 23 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 15 healthy volunteers were measured. sRAGE level increased with COVID-19 severity, need for oxygen therapy, HFNO/MV, ARDS severity, need of dialysis and catecholamine support, 30-day mortality, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) score. sRAGE was found to be a good predictor of MV need in COVID-19 inpatients and mortality with an AUC of 0.871 (0.770-0.973) and 0.903 (0.817-0.990), respectively. When adjusted for male gender, age, comorbidity and SOFA score >= 3, sRAGE was independently associated with risk of need for HFNO/MV. When adjusted for SOFA score >= 3, sRAGE was independently associated with risk of need for MV., CONCLUSIONS: Serum sRAGE concentrations are elevated in COVID-19 patients as disease severity increases. sRAGE should be considered as a biomarker for predicting the need for MV and mortality in COVID-19.",2021,/,Annals of intensive care,11,1,50,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00836-2,33751264,#90984,Lim 2021,"",""
D-Limonene Is a Potential Monoterpene to Inhibit PI3K/Akt/IKK-alpha/NF-kappaB p65 Signaling Pathway in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"Yang, Fan; Chen, Ru; Li, Wan-Yang; Zhu, Hao-Yue; Chen, Xiao-Xuan; Hou, Zhen-Feng; Cao, Ren-Shuang; Zang, GuoDong; Li, Yu-Xuan; Zhang, Wei","At the time of the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pulmonary fibrosis (PF) related to COVID-19 has become the main sequela. However, the mechanism of PF related to COVID (COVID-PF) is unknown. This study aimed to explore the key targets in the development of COVID-PF and the mechanism of d-limonene in the COVID-PF treatment. The differentially expressed genes of COVID-PF were downloaded from the GeneCards database, and their pathways were analyzed. d-Limonene was molecularly docked with related proteins to screen its pharmacological targets, and a rat lung fibrosis model was established to verify d-limonene's effect on COVID-PF-related targets. The results showed that the imbalance between collagen breakdown and metabolism, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis are the core processes of COVID-PF; and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are the key targets of the treatment of COVID-PF. The ability of d-limonene to protect against PF induced by bleomycin in rats was reported. The mechanism is related to the binding of PI3K and NF-kappaB p65, and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/IKK-alpha/NF-kappaB p65 signaling pathway expression and phosphorylation. These results confirmed the relationship between the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and COVID-PF, showing that d-limonene has a potential therapeutic value for COVID-PF.

This study aimed at determining the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among the Ethiopian population during the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed through an online survey using different online platforms. The questionnaire was created through Google Form and the survey link was administered by e-mail, LinkedIn, Telegram, and Facebook. Educated Ethiopian population who have access to the internet were invited to participate through an online survey and addressed to 929 respondents. The study participants completed the survey anonymously without any personal identifier. The psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10-item tool to measure psychological distress. Data were analyzed using SPSS and logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. A generalized additive model was also employed to identify additional predictors using R., RESULTS: The prevalence of high psychological distress among the study population was 236 (25.5%). Of all respondents, 421 (45.1%) had low psychological distress, 274 (29.4%) had moderate psychological distress, 164 (17.6%) had high psychological distress, and 72 (7.3%) had very high psychological distress.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate their effect on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The objective of this meta-analysis and meta-regression is to evaluate outcomes of COVID-19 amongst patients with CVD and HTN., METHODS: English full-text observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were identified searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, following Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocol. Studies having pre-existing CVD and HTN data that described outcomes including mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) utilization were selected. Using random-effects models, risk of composite poor outcomes (meta-analysis) and isolated mortality and IMV utilization (meta-regression) were evaluated. Pooled prevalence of CVD and HTN, correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated. The forest plots and correlation plots were created using random-effects models., RESULTS: Out of 29 studies (n=27,950) that met the criteria, 28 and 27 studies had data on CVD and HTN, respectively. Pooled prevalence of CVD was 18.2% and HTN was 32.7%. In meta-analysis, CVD (OR: 3.36; 95% CI: 2.29-4.94) and HTN (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.57-2.40) were associated with composite poor outcome. In age-adjusted meta-regression, pre-existing CVD was having significantly higher correlation of IMV utilization (r: 0.28; OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.6) without having any association with mortality (r: -0.01; OR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9-1.1) among COVID-19 hospitalizations. HTN was neither correlated with higher IMV utilization (r: 0.01; OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.1) nor correlated with higher mortality (r: 0.001; OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.1)., CONCLUSION: In age-adjusted analysis, though we identified pre-existing CVD as a risk factor for higher utilization of mechanical ventilation, pre-existing CVD and HTN had no independent role in increasing mortality.

Effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on disease recognition and utilisation of healthcare services in the older population in Germany: a cross-sectional study,Michalowsky B.; Hoffmann W.; Bohlken J.; Kostev K. ,"BACKGROUND: There is little evidence about the utilisation of healthcare services and disease recognition in the older population, which was urged to self-isolate during the COVID-19 lockdown. OBJECTIVE(S): We aimed to describe the utilisation of physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions and the recognition of incident diseases in Germany for this age group during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: 1,095 general practitioners (GPs) and 960 specialist practices in Germany. SUBJECTS: 2.45 million older patients aged 65 or older. METHOD(S): The number of documented physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions and incident diagnoses during the imposed lockdown in 2020 was descriptively analysed and compared to 2019. RESULT(S): Physician consultations decrease slightly in February (-2%), increase before the imposed lockdown in March (+9%) and decline in April (-18%) and May (-14%) 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Volumes of hospital admissions decrease earlier and more intensely than physician consultations (-39 versus -6%, respectively). Overall, 15, 16 and 18% fewer incident diagnoses were documented by GPs, neurologists and diabetologists, respectively, in 2020. Diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer and stroke were diagnosed less frequently during the lockdown (-17 to -26%), meaning that the decrease in the recognition of diseases was greater than the decrease in physician consultations.

Depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (analysis of clinical cases),Dorozhenok I.Yu. ,"Currently, in various world regions, the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders due to the impact of coronavirus infection is repeatedly increased compared to that in previous years. Among the predictors of their development during the pandemic, there are COVID-19 symptoms, a history of mental disorders, as well as restrictive measures, and financial losses. The paper describes three clinical cases of depressive disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the depiction of the anamnesis, somatic and mental status, the patholopsychogical qualification of the condition, and the justification of a therapy regimen. The multifactorial stressor effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has provoked an exacerbation of depression in a male patient with a history of affective disorder; the development of a nosogenic depressive reaction of demoralization in a female patient with coronavirus pneumonia; the worsening of somatization dysthymia in a female patient of involutional age. The timely recognition of depression and its treatment with currently available antidepressants have contributed to the achievement of high-quality remission, the increase of stress resistance, and the improvement of quality of life in the patients.Copyright © 2021 Ima-Press Publishing House.

Prenatal exposure to viral infection and neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring: A review of the literature and recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic,Zimmer A.; Youngblood A.; Adnane A.; Miller B.J.; Goldsmith D.R. ,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has emerged as a striking 21st century pandemic. Communities across the globe have experienced significant infection rates and widespread psychosocial stress and trauma, leading to calls for increased allocation of resources for mental health screening and treatment. In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades. We discuss the current understanding of the possible neurotropism and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and relate this to the history of viral pandemics to better understand the relationship of viral infection, aberrant immune response and neurodevelopment, and the risk for schizophrenia disorder.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity",91,"(Zimmer, Youngblood, Adnane, Goldsmith) Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States(Miller) Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States(Goldsmith) Department ",756-770,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.10.024,2010083085,#92532,Zimmer 2021,"",""
Computational drug re-purposing targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as an effective strategy to neutralize COVID-19,Toor H.G.; Banerjee D.I.; Lipsa Rath S.; Darji S.A. ,"COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proficient bioavailability coupled with no predicted in silico toxicity rendered them as prospective alternatives for designing and development of novel combinatorial therapy formulations for improving existing treatment regimes to combat COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,European Journal of Pharmacology,890,"(Toor) P.G.

Diagnostic accuracy of chest computed tomography in improving the false negative rate as compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: A cross sectional analysis of 348 cases from India,Ravikanth R. ,"Background: Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is very important. The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on real-Time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On imaging, computed tomography (CT) manifestations resemble those seen in viral pneumonias, with multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidation in a peripheral distribution being the most common findings. Although these findings lack specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis on imaging grounds, CT could be used to provide objective assessment about the extension of the lung opacities, which could be used as an imaging surrogate for disease burden. We set out to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT scanning in detecting COVID-19 in a population with suspected COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): In this cross-sectional single-center study performed on 348 cases with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at. CT results were compared with PCR test (s) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Result(s): Between February 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 348 symptomatic patients were included. In total, 62.3% of patients had a positive PCR and 69.8% had a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 94.2%, specificity of 76.7%, likelihood ratio (LR) of +2.94 and (LR)-0.18. The sensitivity of the CT tended to be higher in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (100.0%, P = 0.017) and severe COVID-19 (98.5%, P = 0.027) than in patients with mild (82.5%, P = 0.047) and moderate COVID-19 (89.3%, P = 0.039). The diagnostic ability of chest CT was found to be high with 86.3% concordance between findings of CT and PCR. In 48 (13.7%) patients, discordant findings between CT and PCR were observed. In most cases, the CT scan was considered suspicious for COVID-19, while the PCR was negative (37/48, 77.0%). In the majority of these, the diagnosis at discharge was pulmonary infection (n = 26; 54.1%). Conclusion(s): The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic COVID suspect patients is high, but when used as a single diagnostic test, CT cannot accurately diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend a combination of both CT and RT-PCR for future follow-up, management, and medical surveillance.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

We examined epidemiological characteristics associated with severe disease, then with death. We also compared mortality between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with and without iRMD. Method(s): Individuals with suspected iRMD-COVID-19 were included in this French cohort. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of severe COVID-19. The most significant clinically relevant factors were analysed by multivariable penalised logistic regression models, using a forward selection method. The death rate of hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 (moderate-severe) was compared with a subset of patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19 from a French hospital matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. Result(s): Of 694 adults, 438 (63%) developed mild (not hospitalised), 169 (24%) moderate (hospitalised out of the intensive care unit (ICU) and 87 (13%) severe (patients in ICU/deceased) disease. In multivariable imputed analyses, the variables associated with severe infection were age (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25-0.80), body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.01-3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.09-3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95% CI: 1.47-29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.61-10.98). Fifty-eight patients died (8% (total) and 23% (hospitalised)). Compared with 175 matched hospitalised patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19, the OR of mortality associated with hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 was 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87-2.42) (n=175 each group). Conclusion(s): In the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, as already identified in the general population, older age, male gender, obesity, and hypertension were found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Patients with iRMD on corticosteroids, but not methotrexate, or tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 inhibitors, should be considered as more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Unlike common comorbidities such as obesity, and cardiovascular or lung diseases, the risk of death is not significantly increased in patients with iRMD.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Method(s): We conducted a prospective cohort study on 49 HCWs who worked in close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. HCWs had blood samples taken every 2 weeks to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two different types of assay. Result(s): Forty-nine participants (31 nurses, 15 doctors, 3 other workers) were enrolled. In total, 112 blood samples are obtained from participants. The median work days in 2 weeks was 9 (interquartile range (IQR): 5-10) days. In a single work day, 30 of the 49 participants (61.5%) had contact with patients with suspected or conformed SARS-CoV-2 at least 8 times, and approximately 60% of participants had more than 10 min of contact with a single patient. The median self-reported compliance to PPE was 90% (IQR: 80-100%). Seven participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); however, none were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, so the positive ELISA results were assumed to be false-positive.

Autoimmune Hepatitis-Primary Biliary Cholangitis Overlap Syndrome Triggered by COVID-19.,"Singh, Balraj; Kaur, Parminder; Maroules, Michael","COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has caused the ongoing global pandemic. Initially considered a respiratory disease, it can manifest with a wide range of complications (gastrointestinal, neurological, thromboembolic and cardiovascular) leading to multiple organ dysfunction. A range of immune complications have also been described. We report the case of a 57-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, prediabetes and beta thalassemia minor, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently developed fatigue and arthralgias, and whose blood work showed hyperferritinemia, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT/GGT), hypergammaglobulinemia, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cholangitis overlap syndrome triggered by COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first such case reported., LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 can precipitate a wide range of immune complications; we report a case of autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cholangitis overlap syndrome triggered by COVID-19.Clinicians should be aware of this unusual manifestation of COVID-19 so that prompt and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions can be initiated if the syndrome is suspected or confirmed.Our case further suggests the necessity for continued and regular follow-up of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in order to uncover the long-term effects of the novel virus.

Recently, it was shown that Coronil rescued humanized zebrafish from SARS-CoV-2 induced pathologies. Based on reported computational studies on the phytochemicals present in Coronil, it could be a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell and associated cytokines' production., Methods: Through an ELISA-based biochemical assay, effects of Coronil on interaction between ACE-2 and different mutants of viral spike (S) protein, crucial for viral invasion of host cell, were evaluated. Additionally, using recombinant pseudoviruses having SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in their envelopes and firefly luciferase reporter in their genomes, effects of Coronil on virus entry into human alveolar epithelial cells were evaluated through luciferase assay. UHPLC profiled Coronil also modulated S-protein mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in A549 cells, like interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as evaluated through RT-qPCR and ELISA., Results: Coronil effectively inhibited the interaction of ACE-2 not only with the wild-type S protein (SWT) but also with its currently prevalent and more infectious variant (SD614G) and another mutant (SW436R) with significantly higher affinity toward ACE-2. Treatment with Coronil significantly reduced the increased levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in A549 cells incubated with different S-protein variants in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, it also prevented the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVppSARS-2S) mediated cytokine response in these cells by reducing entry of pseudoviruses into host cells., Conclusion: Coronil prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mediated viral entry into A549 cells by inhibiting spike protein-ACE-2 interactions.

During August 10-December 21, 2020, a total of 63,654 COVID-19 cases were reported in school-aged children; an estimated 60% of these cases were not school-related. Fewer than 1% of registered students were identified as having school-related COVID-19 and <11% of K-12 schools reported outbreaks. District incidences among students correlated with the background disease incidence in the county; resumption of in-person education was not associated with a proportionate increase in COVID-19 among school-aged children. Higher rates among students were observed in smaller districts, districts without mandatory mask-use policies, and districts with a lower proportion of students participating in remote learning.

Association between Chronic Statin Use and 30-Day Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19.,"Yetmar, Zachary A; Challener, Douglas W; Tleyjeh, Imad M; Sohail, M Rizwan; Cerhan, James R; Badley, Andrew D; O'Horo, John C","Objective: To determine the association between chronic statin use and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19., Patients and Methods: We identified a retrospective cohort of patients requiring admission at the Mayo Clinic using our enterprise-wide COVID-19 registry from March 1st, 2020, through September 30th, 2020. Available information included age, gender, use of statins, medical comorbidities, and 30-day mortality. We estimated the association of statins with 30-day mortality using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from logistic regression modeling., Results: 1295 patients between the ages of 30 and 80 tested positive for COVID-19 and required admission during the study period, of whom 500 (38.6%) were taking statins at admission. Patients taking statins were older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 59 (4.6%) died. In multivariable analysis, statin users did not have statistically different odds of death within 30 days with OR of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.64-2.03, P=.67) compared to non-users., Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 taking statins had similar 30-day mortality to those not taking statins, after adjusting for relevant covariates. Although this is partly influenced by a higher prevalence of risk factors for more severe COVID-19 presentation not entirely adjusted for by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, these data would not support statins as a likely therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 in the hospital setting.

"New challenges to fighting COVID-19: Virus variants, potential vaccines, and development of antivirals.","Chen, Jun; Lu, Hongzhou","Despite strict control measures implemented worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage. Several drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and remdesivir, have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 during the past year. While most of the drugs failed to display efficacy in treating COVID-19, scientists have encouraged herd immunity to control the pandemic. Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19. Rapid production and extensive vaccination are also essential to preventing the emergence of new variants. Nevertheless, antivirals including monoclonal antibodies and oral medicines need to be developed in light of uncertainties with regard to vaccination. In the battle between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the speed with which we fight the virus, and especially its emerging variants, is the key to winning.",2021,/,Bioscience trends,,101502754,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.5582/bst.2021.01092,33746183,#91126,Chen 2021,"",""
RT-PCR Screening Tests for SARS-CoV-2 with Saliva Samples in Asymptomatic People: Strategy to Maintain Social and Economic Activities while Reducing the Risk of Spreading the Virus.,"Oba, Junna; Taniguchi, Hiroaki; Sato, Masae; Takamatsu, Reika; Morikawa, Satoru; Nakagawa, Taneaki; Takaishi, Hiromasa; Saya, Hideyuki; Matsuo, Koichi; Nishihara, Hiroshi","The year 2020 will be remembered for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which continues to affect the whole world. Early and accurate identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is fundamental to combat the disease. Among the current diagnostic tests, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable and frequently used method. Herein, we discuss the interpretation of RT-qPCR results relative to viral infectivity. Although nasopharyngeal swab samples are often used for RT-qPCR testing, they require collection by trained medical staff. Saliva samples are emerging as an inexpensive and efficient alternative for large-scale screening. Pooled-sample testing of saliva has been applied for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current policies recommend isolating people with borderline cycle threshold (Ct) values (35<Ct <40), despite these Ct values indicating minimal infection risk. We propose the new concept of a ""social cut-off"" Ct value and risk stratification based on the correlation of Ct with infectivity. We also describe the experience of RT-qPCR screening of saliva samples at our institution.

Changes in smoking behavior since the declaration of the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan : A cross sectional study from the Osaka health app.,"Koyama, Shihoko; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Okawa, Sumiyo; Kadobayashi, Takayoshi; Shirai, Hisaya; Nakatani, Takeshi; Miyashiro, Isao","OBJECTIVES: In April 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and infection control measures, including requests to work from home and stay-at-home restrictions, were introduced. This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency., METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers, before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates., RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men; PR=1.38(1.17-1.62), 65 years old+; PR=2.45(1.92-3.12)) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men; PR=0.85(0.78-0.93), 65 years old+; PR=0.38(0.29-0.49)). Additionally, respondents working from home or living alone had significantly higher PR for increased smoking (working from home; PR=1.29(1.17-1.41), living alone; PR=1.23(1.10-1.38)) and respondents who changed from cigarettes to heated tobacco products (HTPs) had significantly lower PR for quitting smoking (PR=0.15(0.04-0.58))., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency.

COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children presenting uniquely with sinus node dysfunction in the setting of shock.,"Tomlinson, Lesya G; Cohen, Mitchell I; Levorson, Rebecca E; Tzeng, Megan B","SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, generally has a mild disease course in children. However, a severe post-infectious inflammatory process known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has been observed in association with COVID-19. This inflammatory process is a result of an abnormal immune response with similar clinical features to Kawasaki disease. It is well established that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is associated with myocardial dysfunction, coronary artery dilation or aneurysms, and occasionally arrhythmias. The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities seen include premature atrial or ventricular ectopy, variable degrees of atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation, and rarely, haemodynamically significant arrhythmias necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.

The Emergency Next Time,"Ben-Asher, Noa","This Article offers a new conceptual framework to understand the connection between law and violence in national emergencies. It is by now well-established that governments often commit state violence in times of national security crisis by implementing excessive emergency measures. The Article calls this type of legal violence &ldquo;Emergency-Affirming Violence.&rdquo; But Emergency Violence can also be committed through governmental non-action. This type of violence, which this Article calls, &ldquo;Emergency-Denying Violence,&rdquo; has come to stark light in the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Article offers a new taxonomy to better understand the phenomenon of Emergency Violence. Using 9/11 and COVID-19 as examples, the Article proposes that there are two types of Emergency Violence: Emergency-Affirming Violence and Emergency-Denying Violence. Emergency-Affirming Violence occurs when the government (1) declares and emphasizes the magnitude of an emergency; (2) calls for robust deference to experts; and (3) aggressively pursues emergency measures. Emergency-Denying Violence, by contrast, occurs when the government (1) denies or minimizes the existence of an emergency; (2) ignores or undermines experts; and (3) declines to take significant emergency measures. The Article demonstrates how the three branches of government can engage in both types of Emergency Violence. Analyzing the legal responses to the two national crises of 9/11 and COVID-19 side-by-side, the Article underscores the vulnerable individuals and communities against whom Emergency Violence is unleashed via both Emergency-Affirming and Emergency-Denying Violence. The Article proposes a principle of Emergency Non-Violence to guide public response to the next emergency.",2021,,,,,,PPR301730,10.2139/ssrn.3808134,,#93009,Ben-Asher 2021,"",""

Cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections due to anti-IFNγ autoantibodies (Ab) were first reported in 2004. NTM and COVID-19 co-infection in a patient with acquired IFNγ deficiency has not previously been described. The impact of anti-IFNγ Ab on the severity of COVID-19 has not been previously explored. <h4>Objective: </h4> We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a patient hospitalised with NTM infection due to acquired IFNγ deficiency caused by anti-IFNγ Ab. We also explore effects of IFNγ Ab on the severity of COVID-19 infection. <h4>Methods: </h4> Detailed immunological investigations were performed. Bio-rad, Bio-Plex methodology was used to detect anti-IFNγ Ab, titration, IFNγ recovery assay and SARS-CoV-2 serology. Anti-IFNγ Ab were tested in patients with severe (COV-Pat) and health care workers with mild/asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (COV-Asx). <h4>Results: </h4>: Mycobacterium avium intracellulare was diagnosed following bone marrow examination and culture. High titre anti-IFNγ Ab were detected in patient’s serum. The autoantibodies neutralized both endogenously produced and exogenously administered IFNγ. SARS-COV-2 infection was identified during routine inpatient testing. Despite prolonged SARS-COV-2 infection the patient showed only minimal additional symptoms, never developed any significant inflammatory complications and eventually mounted an adequate IgG antibody response to the SARS-COV-2 trimeric S-protein. Elevated titres of anti-IFNγ Ab were detected in COV-Pat and COV-Asx, compared to non-infected healthy controls. The titres were broadly similar between COV-Pat and COV-Asx groups, but much lower compared to patients with acquired IFNγ Ab deficiency. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> IFN-γ is known to play a central role in hyperinflammatory disease states such as macrophage activation syndrome This study illustrates the potential value of inhibiting IFNγ to prevent pathological inflammatory response to COVID-19.",2021,,,,,,PPR301624,10.21203/rs.3.rs-310411/v1,,#93007,Kacar 2021,"",""

We customized Illumina’s Infinium Methylation EPIC array to enhance immune response detection and profiled peripheral blood samples from 164 COVID-19 patients with longitudinal measurements of disease severity and 296 patient controls. Epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 13,033 genome-wide significant methylation sites for case-vs-control status.

T-cell receptor sequencing identifies prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates with neutralizing antibody titers and disease severity,"Elyanow, Rebecca; Snyder, Thomas; Dalai, Sudeb; Gittelman, Rachel; Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Wald, Anna; Selke, Stacy; Wener, Mark; Morishima, Chihiro; Greninger, Alex; Holbrook, Michael; Kaplan, Ian; Zahid, Jabran; Carlson, Jonathan; Baldo, Lance; Manley, Thomas; Robins, Harlan; Koelle, David","Measuring the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can enable the assessment of past infection as well as protective immunity and the risk of reinfection. While neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers are one measure of protection, such assays are challenging to perform at a large scale and the longevity of the SARS-CoV-2 nAb response is not fully understood. Here, we apply a T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay that can be performed on a small volume standard blood sample to assess the adaptive T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were collected from a cohort of 302 individuals recovered from COVID-19 up to 6 months after infection. Previously published findings in this cohort showed that two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays correlate well with nAb testing. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response strongly correlates with nAb titer, as well as clinical indicators of disease severity including hospitalization, fever, or difficulty breathing. While the depth and breadth of the T-cell response declines during convalescence, the T-cell signal remains well above background with high sensitivity up to at least 6 months following initial infection. Compared to serology tests detecting binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein, the overall sensitivity of the TCR-based assay across the entire cohort and all timepoints was approximately 5% greater for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the improved performance of T-cell testing compared to serology was most apparent in recovered individuals who were not hospitalized and were sampled beyond 150 days of their initial illness, suggesting that antibody testing may have reduced sensitivity in individuals who experienced less severe COVID-19 illness and at later timepoints. Finally, T-cell testing was able to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in 68% (55/81) of convalescent samples having nAb titers below the lower limit of detection, as well as 37% (13/35) of samples testing negative by all three antibody assays. These results demonstrate the utility of a TCR-based assay as a scalable, reliable measure of past SARS-CoV-2 infection across a spectrum of disease severity. Additionally, the TCR repertoire may be useful as a surrogate for protective immunity with additive clinical value beyond serologic or nAb testing methods.",2021,,,,,,PPR301072,10.1101/2021.03.19.21251426,,#93001,Elyanow 2021,"",""

Brazil is currently the third country in the world in the number of COVID-19 cases. Even though all Brazilian regions and states have reported a high number of cases, mortality rates varies among them. Environmental and genetic factors may influence the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2. The Brazilian population is highly heterogeneous, with different colonization and immigration histories in each region resulting in different genetic backgrounds. Here, we test if specific HLA haplotypes are associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Brazil.MethodsHLA data was obtained from The Brazilian Voluntary Bone Marrow Donors Registry (REDOME) which harbors data from more than four million individual donors, and COVID-19 data was retrieved from epidemiological bulletins issued by State Health Secretariats via the Ministry of Health of Brazil. We tested the association between the most frequent HLA haplotypes in Brazil and COVID-19 incidence and mortality using Spearman's correlation analysis.ResultsNo correlation between HLA haplotypes and COVID-19 rates was found when we analyzed data from the 26 states and Federal District, as well as when we analyzed data from the 90 cities with at least 50 deaths registered in the São Paulo state. Significant negative correlation (suggestive of protection) between COVID-19 mortality and haplotypes HLA-A*01~B*08~DRB1*03, HLA-A*29~B*44~DRB1*07 and HLA-A*02~B*44~DRB1*04 was found when analyzing data from cities with at least 50 deaths registered in the entire country.ConclusionsOur results do not support an association of specific HLA haplotypes with an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV2 or dying from COVID-19 in Brazil.

Pneumothorax in Neonates Born to COVID-19-Positive Mothers: Fact or Fortuity?.,"Kamity, Ranjith; Nayak, Amrita; Dumpa, Vikramaditya","Neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been largely asymptomatic based on initial reports. All neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 have tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our institution (published data as of April 12, 2020). As novel presentations of COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children are being increasingly reported, we raise the possibility of increased incidence of pneumothorax in neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. Two recently described neonates with COVID-19 infection were noted to have pneumothoraces. We describe two SARS-CoV-2-negative neonates born to COVID-19-positive mothers at 38 and 33 weeks, respectively, admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress and subsequently developed pneumothoraces. As diverse clinical presentations in various age groups are being described, it becomes difficult to differentiate the increased incidence of complications related to an underlying illness, from COVID-19-related illness. It remains to be seen if neonates with in utero exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have an elevated inflammatory response with pneumonitis and exaggerated lung disease, similar to adult COVID-19 patients, due to in utero exposure.

Olfactory Dysfunction in Frontline Health Care Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil.,"Sbrana, Mariana Ferreira; Fornazieri, Marco Aurelio; Bruni-Cardoso, Alexandre; Avelino-Silva, Vivian I; Schechtman, Deborah; Voegels, Richard Louis; Malnic, Bettina; Glezer, Isaias; de Rezende Pinna, Fabio","Upper respiratory viral infections can decrease the sense of smell either by inflammatory restriction of nasal airflow that carries the odorant molecules or through interference in olfactory sensory neuron function. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), worldwide reports of severe smell loss (anosmia/hyposmia) revealed a different type of olfactory dysfunction associated with respiratory virus infection. Since self-reported perception of smell is subjective and SARS-CoV-2 exposure is variable in the general population, we aimed to study a population that would be more homogeneously exposed to the virus. Here, we investigated the prevalence of olfactory loss in frontline health professionals diagnosed with COVID-19 in Brazil, one of the major epicenters of the disease. We also analyzed the rate of olfactory function recovery and the particular characteristics of olfactory deficit in this population. A widely disclosed cross-sectional online survey directed to health care workers was developed by a group of researchers to collect data concerning demographic information, general symptoms, otolaryngological symptoms, comorbidities, and COVID-19 test results. Of the 1,376 health professionals who completed the questionnaire, 795 (57.8%) were working directly with COVID-19 patients, either in intensive care units, emergency rooms, wards, outpatient clinics, or other areas. Five-hundred forty-one (39.3%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 509 (37%) were not tested. Prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19-positive subjects was 83.9% (454 of 541) compared to 12.9% (42 of 326) of those who tested negative and to 14.9% (76 of 509) of those not tested. Olfactory dysfunction incidence was higher in those working in wards, emergency rooms, and intensive care units compared to professionals in outpatient clinics. In general, remission from olfactory symptoms was frequent by the time of responses. Taste disturbances were present in 74.1% of infected participants and were significantly associated with hyposmia.

Corticosteroids and mortality in patients with severe Covid-19 who have autoantibodies,"Cui, Zhu; Roth, Maxwell; Averbukh, Yelena; Assa, Andrei; Ani, Azal Al; Southern, William; Gil, Morayma Reyes; Arora, Shitij","Auto-reactivity in COVID-19 is increasingly being recognized and may identify a group of patients with inflammation severe enough to result in loss of self-tolerance. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents and now the standard of care for patients with severe Covid-19 requiring oxygen support/mechanical ventilation. We studied the outcomes of COVID-19 patients who demonstrated clinically identifiable auto-reactivity and received corticosteroid treatment. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 51 COVID-19 patients admitted between March 10, 2020 and May 2, 2020 who received corticosteroid treatment and also had serum sample in our institution bio-bank available for ANA and RF ELISA. Twelve patients (23.5%) had positive ANA or RF. Mortality rate among patients with positive autoantibodies was significantly higher than those without (9/12 or 75% versus 13/39 or 33.3%, p= 0.02).

Untangling the cell immune response dynamic for severe and critical cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Blanco-Rodríguez, Rodolfo; Du, Xin; Hernández-Vargas, Esteban","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> COVID-19 is a global pandemic leading high death tolls worldwide day by day. Clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients can be classified as non-severe, severe and critical cases. In particular, studies have highlighted the relationship between the lymphopenia and the severity of the illness, where CD8 + T cells have the lowest levels in critical cases. In this work, we aim to elucidate the key parameters that define the course of the disease deviating from severe to critical case. To this end, several mathematical models are proposed to represent the dynamic of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best model had a good fit to reported experimental data, and in accordance with values found in the literature. Our results suggest that a rapid proliferation of CD8 + T cells is decisive in the severity of the disease.",2021,,,,,,PPR302331,10.1101/2021.03.23.436686,,#93024,Blanco-Rodríguez 2021,"",""
Proteinuria as a Biomarker for COVID-19 Severity.,"Ouahmi, Hajar; Courjon, Johan; Morand, Lucas; Francois, Juliette; Bruckert, Vincent; Lombardi, Romain; Esnault, Vincent; Seitz-Polski, Barbara; Demonchy, Elisa; Dellamonica, Jean; Boyer-Suavet, Sonia","Background: Renal involvement in syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been retrospectively described, especially acute kidney injury (AKI). However, quantitative proteinuria assessment and its implication in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown., Methods: In this prospective, multicenter study in France, we collected clinical and biological data including urinary protein to creatine ratio (UPCR) in patients presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19. Clinical outcome was analyzed according to the level of UPCR., Results: 42/45 patients (93.3%) had renal involvement (abnormal urinary sediment and/or AKI). Significant proteinuria occurred in 60% of patients. Urine protein electrophoresis showed tubular protein excretion in 83.8% of patients with proteinuria. Inflammatory parametersand D-dimer concentrations correlated with proteinuria level. Patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission had higher proteinuria (p = 0.008). On multivariate analysis, proteinuria greater than 0.3 g/g was related to a higher prevalence of ICU admission [OR = 4.72, IC95 (1.16-23.21), p = 0.03], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [OR = 6.89, IC95 (1.41-53.01, p = 0.02)], nosocomial infections [OR = 3.75, IC95 (1.11-13.55), p = 0.03], longer inpatient hospital stay (p = 0.003)., Conclusion: Renal involvement is common in moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Anti-IL5 Drugs in COVID-19 Patients: Role of Eosinophils in SARS-CoV-2-Induced Immunopathology.,"Pala, Daniele; Pistis, Marco","SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates a complex activation of the immune system. Eosinophils belong to the host's defense equipment against respiratory viruses. In the first phase of the infection, eosinophils contribution is probably appropriate and beneficial, as they facilitate the suppression of the viral replication. However, in severe COVID-19 patients, during the second and third phases of the disease, eosinophils may participate in a maladaptive immune response and directly contribute to immunopathology. In fact, in severe patients, the immune response is prevalently T helper 1 type, but T helper 2 is also present. Eosinophils' expansion and activation are stimulated by Type 2 cytokines, especially IL-5. Moreover, bronchial asthma, in which eosinophils play a central role, seems not to be a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. Among possible explanations, asthmatic patients are often treated with corticosteroids, which have been demonstrated to reduce the progression to critical COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. In addition to steroids, severe asthmatic patients are currently treated with biological drugs that target Type 2 immune response. Because IL-5 is necessary for the growth, survival, and activation of eosinophils, IL-5 inhibitors, such as mepolizumab, decrease the peripheral blood count of eosinophils, but do not influence eosinophils activation in the airway. In severe COVID-19 patients, the blockade of eosinophils' activation might contrast harmful immunity.

Seropositivity was higher in females (35%) than in males (30%) overall and in nearly every age group. In these 12 cities, seroprevalence rose from about 18% in July to 41% by December, with steeper increases at ages <20 and 20-44 years than at older ages.

"Associations Between Prenatal Food Insecurity and Prematurity, Pediatric Health Care Utilization, and Postnatal Social Needs",Sandoval V.S.; Jackson A.; Saleeby E.; Smith L.; Schickedanz A. ,"Objective: Childhood food insecurity endangers child development and health outcomes. Food insecurity will grow increasingly common in the economic wake of the coronavirus pandemic and prenatal care represents an early, clinical opportunity to identify families at risk. However, longitudinal relationships between clinically-identified prenatal food insecurity and prematurity, pediatric health care utilization, and postnatal social needs have not been described. Method(s): We examined longitudinal data from mother-child dyads who received prenatal and pediatric care and social needs screening at a large academically-affiliated safety net medical center between October 2018 and July 2019. Associations among household food insecurity and premature birth, pediatric inpatient and outpatient utilization, missed immunizations, and postnatal social needs were estimated using adjusted regression. Result(s): Among the 268 mothers, those who experienced prenatal household food insecurity had 3 times higher odds of having a child born prematurely (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.9, P =.05) and had children with higher inpatient hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6, P =.04) and missed immunizations (IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.3, P =.03) in the first 6 months of the child's life. These mothers also had higher odds of having any social needs in the pediatric setting (odds ratio 3.4; 95% CI 1.5-8.0, P =.004).

Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated in patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the Fatebenefratelli-Sacco Hospital in Milan, the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, its association with the severity of COVID-19, with the levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer and interleukin-6 and with clinical outcome over a follow-up period of 30 days. Urinalysis was evaluated in a subgroup of patients. Result(s): Serum albumin levels <30 g/L were found in 105/207 (50.7%) patients at hospital admission. Overall, the median albumin value was 29.5 g/L (IQR 25-32.8). A negative association was found between albumin levels and severity of COVID-19 (P <.0001) and death (P =.003). An inverse correlation was observed between albumin and both C-reactive protein and D-dimer at hospital admission (r = -.487 and r = -.479, respectively; P <.0001).

To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt. METHOD(S): Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests. RESULT(S): Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27.6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n=54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever >=38degreeC and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n=116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0). CONCLUSION(S): The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

"Human cell-dependent, directional, time-dependent changes in the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","Iwasaki, Yuki; Abe, Takashi; Ikemura, Toshimichi","BACKGROUND: When a virus that has grown in a nonhuman host starts an epidemic in the human population, human cells may not provide growth conditions ideal for the virus. Therefore, the invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is usually prevalent in the bat population, into the human population is thought to have necessitated changes in the viral genome for efficient growth in the new environment. In the present study, to understand host-dependent changes in coronavirus genomes, we focused on the mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and investigated how these compositions changed time-dependently in the human cellular environment. We also compared the oligonucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses prevalent in humans or bats to investigate the causes of changes in the host environment., RESULTS: Time-series analyses of changes in the nucleotide compositions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a group of mono- and oligonucleotides whose compositions changed in a common direction for all clades, even though viruses belonging to different clades should evolve independently.

METHOD(S): Public Health England conducts invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in England. IPD trends during 2000/2001-2019/2020 epidemiological years were analyzed and cases during February-June 2020 linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULT(S): IPD incidence in 2019/2020 (7.6/100 000; n = 3964) was 30% (IRR, .70; 95% CI, .18-2.67) lower compared with 2018/2019 (10.9/100 000; n = 5666), with large reductions observed across all age groups during March-June 2020. There were 160 886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) co-infections (.025% [95% CI, .018-.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD, and 27 who developed COVID-19 >=28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFRs) were 62.5 (25/40), 47.6% (10/21), and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (P < .001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 coinfection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared with patients with IPD only. CONCLUSION(S): Large declines in IPD were observed following COVID-19 lockdown. IPD/COVID-19 coinfections were rare but associated with high CFR, mainly in older adults. The rarity, age and serotype distribution of IPD/COVID-19 coinfections do not support wider extension of pneumococcal vaccination.Copyright © Crown copyright 2020.",2021,/,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,72,5,e65-e75,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1728,633442155,#92462,Amin-Chowdhury 2021,"",""

The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case., METHODS: This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r 800/200 mg twice daily for 14 days (intervention arm) versus no intervention (control arm), using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged > 6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35, and 90 includes comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic, and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at alpha = 0.05, assuming the secondary attack rate in ring members (p0) = 15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p0, ICC, and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Participants who test positive at baseline will be excluded from the primary analysis but will be maintained for additional analyses to examine the impact of LPV/r on early treatment., DISCUSSION: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Time in nature associated with decreased fatigue in UK truck drivers,Longman D.P.; Shaw C.N.; Varela-Mato V.; Sherry A.P.; Ruettger K.; Sayyah M.; Guest A.; Chen Y.-L.; Paine N.J.; King J.A.; Clemes S.A. ,"Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driving is recognised as a highly hazardous occupation due to the long periods of sedentary behaviour, low levels of physical activity and unhealthy food options when working. These risk factors combine with shift work and concomitant irregular sleep patterns to increase the prevalence of fatigue. Fatigue is closely linked with stress and, subsequently, poor physiological and psychological health. In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean +/- SD age: 51.0 +/- 9 years, body mass index: 29.8 +/- 4.7 kg/m2) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression. As fatigue has a range of physical and mental health sequelae, we propose that increased exposure to natural settings may make a valuable contribution to interventions to promote the health and wellbeing of this underserved group.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

We describe how we adapted our Thetha Nami (talk to me) peer-led HIV intervention to continue to support adolescents and youth in rural KwaZulu-Natal during national lockdown. Method(s): Thetha Nami is delivered by community-based peer navigators (12 men, 40 women aged 18 to 30), as part of a trial to assess the effectiveness of serostatus neutral peer-support on HIV outcomes in young people aged 16 to 29. It included: creating safe spaces for youth; peer-led sexual health promotion; youth-friendly clinical services; and peer-mentorship to improve retention in HIV prevention. Our adaptation was to transform the peer-support from face-to-face to virtual support using programme data, meeting notes, training schedules and peer navigator activity logs. Result(s): (At time of lockdown 349 participants (174 men, 175 women) aged 16 to 29 had been recruited, with 174 randomised to Thetha Nami. We set up four virtual Microsoft Teams groups to supervise peer navigators (13 per group). The weekly virtual meetings covered how to: provide virtual support; refer urgent clinical issues; and respond to Covid-19 questions. The study team sent weekly voice notes via WhatsApp to recap important points. Peer-support from navigators to participants was moved to telephone calls, SMS and WhatsApp messages. The redcap tool used by peer navigators to record and guide their community-based activities was adapted to assist remote support of participants. After eight weeks of lockdown, peer navigators had met every week and made: 318 contact attempts; five clinical referrals or follow-ups; and offered support to 130 (74.7%) of assigned participants, with only six refusing virtual contact.

Recently, its use for the treatment/prophylaxis of COVID-19 has been widely debated. How HCQ might impact the immune response remains mostly unknown. We have previously conducted a study to determine if HCQ or aspirin can reduce inflammation and HIV target cells to protect against HIV. Method(s): A randomized open-labeled pilot study was conducted in 2014 in Nairobi, Kenya. Thirty-nine HIV seronegative women were randomized into the HCQ study arm. Blood (PBMC, plasma) and vaginal samples were collected at three time points from all the participants: baseline (Visit 1), two weeks post-drug initiation (Visit 2) and six weeks post-drug initiation (Visit 3). Flow cytometry and multiplex bead array were used to determine the level of T cell immune activation and inflammation. Result(s): In the blood, we observed that at V2 there was an increase in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, TNF-alpha and MIP-3alpha compared to baseline. Interestingly, after six weeks (V3) the level of those cytokines returned to baseline levels. Level of total IgG was lower compared to baseline at each following visit. Among PMBCs, we observed that at V2 there was an increase in the proportion of CD4+ T cells and decreased of Th17 (CD4+ CD161+), Tc17 (CD8+ CD161+) and Tc17CD95+ (CD8+ CD161+ CD95+) compared to baseline. After six weeks, the percentage of CD4+ was still higher compared to baseline, however, the proportion of CD4+ CCR5+, Th17CCR5+, CD8+ CCR5+, Tc17CCR5+, Tc1795+ and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ TIGIT+ was decreased. Furthermore, following CEF peptide pool stimulation, we found decreased in T cells co-expressing IFNgamma and TNFalpha with corresponding increases in the number of cells expressing only one of the cytokines. Conclusion(s): Herein, we showed that inflammatory markers increased temporally after two weeks on HCQ but returned to baseline level after six weeks.

Using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the performance of NEWS/NEWS2 to discriminate the combined outcome of either death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 24-hours of a vital sign set in five cohorts: COVID-19 positive (n=405), COVID-19 not-detected (n=1717), COVID-19 not tested (n=2952), Control 2018 (n=6275), Control 2019 (n=6524). Result(s): After exclusions, the main data extract (01/01/2018 - 03/05/20) contained 2,867,313 vital sign sets from 97,669 admissions. Admissions in the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 not-detected cohorts were older (p<0.001), and those in the COVID-19 positive cohort were more likely to be male (p<0.001), with a higher mean EWS during their stay. Figure 1 demonstrates an increasing risk of the combined outcome with increasing NEWS/NEWS2 value in all 5 cohorts. The AUROC values for NEWS/NEWS2 for the combined outcome of either death or ICU admission were: COVID-19 positive 0.880 (0.866-0.894); COVID-19 not-detected 0.881 (0.867-0.895); COVID-19 not tested 0.869 (0.842-0.896); Control 2018 0.896 (0.886-0.906) and Control 2019 0.844 (0.831-0.857). (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that NEWS/NEWS2 are good discriminators of either death or ICU admission within 24-hours of a vital sign set in patients with COVID-19. There was very little difference between the AUROC values in the COVID-19 positive cohort compared to any of our other study cohorts suggesting amendments to NEWS/NEWS2 are unnecessary when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Our results support the recommendations by the RCP, WHO and NICE for the use of NEWS/NEWS2 for the assessment of acute-illness severity in patients with COVID-19.",2021,/,Thorax,76,SUPPL 1,A59,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2020-BTSabstracts.102,634542979,#92128,Fox 2021,"",""

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies., METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken., FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78.2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5.6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6.92% (95% CI 6.41-7.43) in the population. 437 (82.1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13.0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15.8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39.8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44.6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41.2%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5.6 [IQR 1/2.0 to 1/14.0] at baseline vs 1/5.6 [1/4.0 to 1/11.2] at first follow-up [p=1.0] and 1/6.3 [1/2.0 to 1/12.6] at second follow-up [p=0.29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89.7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92.1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90.9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals)., INTERPRETATION: 6.92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39.8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies.

Fetomaternal immune crosstalk modifies T cell priming through sustained changes to DC function,Lacorcia M.; Bhattacharjee S.; Laubhahn K.; Alhamdan F.; Ram M.; Muschaweckh A.; Potaczek D.P.; Kosinska A.; Garn H.; Protzer U.; Renz H.; Prazeres da Costa C. ,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to infections can modify immune development. These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness, and associated with variations in co-infection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE(S): Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as relate to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this work seeking to clarify further effects and underlying immunological imprinting. METHOD(S): Here, we combine a chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection model with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULT(S): We demonstrate that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge, in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we uncover previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T cell responses during immunization, dependent upon vaccine formulation, that have functional impact upon the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine Hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION(S): Alongside steady-state modifications to CD4+ T cell polarization and B cell priming, we trace these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal crosstalk.Copyright © 2021.

Identification of macrophage activation-related biomarkers in obese type 2 diabetes that may be indicative of enhanced respiratory risk in COVID-19.,"Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Diboun, Ilhame; Atkin, Stephen L; Butler, Alexandra E","Hyperactivation of the immune system through obesity and diabetes may enhance infection severity complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The objective was to determine the circulatory biomarkers for macrophage activation at baseline and after serum glucose normalization in obese type 2 diabetes (OT2D) subjects. A case-controlled interventional pilot study in OT2D (n = 23) and control subjects (n = 23). OT2D subjects underwent hyperinsulinemic clamp to normalize serum glucose. Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-h of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFGbeta-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D. Conventional mediators of both M1 and M2 macrophage activation markers (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-13) were not altered. No changes were observed in plasma levels of M1/M2 macrophage activation markers in OT2D in response to acute normalization of glycemia. In the basal state, macrophage activation markers are elevated, and these reflect the expression of circulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, that were not changed by glucose normalisation. These differences could potentially predispose diabetic individuals to increased infection severity complicated by ARDS.

An overview on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),Hui D.S.C. ,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease that has caught the medical profession by surprise in 2003. The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea but diarrhea occurs in 40-70% of patients after hospital admission. Respiratory failure is the major complication of SARS; at least half of the patients require supplemental oxygen during the acute phase whereas about 20% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support. In contrast, the severity is generally mild in infected young children. Due to our limited understanding of this new disease, treatment of SARS was empirical in 2003. Protease inhibitor (Lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may play a role as antiviral therapy in the early phase whereas nelfinavir is a promising alternative. The role of interferon and systemic steroid in preventing immune-mediated lung injury deserves further investigation. In addition, other anti-viral treatment, RNA interference, monoclonal antibody, synthetic peptides, and vaccines are being developed. Rapid diagnosis, early isolation, and good infection control measures are important in preventing spread of the infection.",2005,/,Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease - Pulmonary Series,63,3,149-157,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2005.632,41700742,#91943,Hui 2005,"",""

"The Relationship Between Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 Prognosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Wuhan, China",Shang J.; Wang Q.; Zhang H.; Wang X.; Wan J.; Yan Y.; Gao Y.; Cheng J.; Li Z.; Lin J. ,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that first appeared in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the world. We aimed to understand the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the prognosis of COVID-19. Method(s): Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatments, complications, and clinical outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between diabetes (n = 84) and nondiabetes (n = 500) groups. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox analysis were applied to determine the risk factors for the prognosis of COVID-19. Result(s): Compared with nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients had higher levels of neutrophils (P = .014), C-reactive protein (P = .008), procalcitonin (P < .01), and D-dimer (P = .033), and lower levels of lymphocytes (P = .032) and albumin (P = .035). Furthermore, diabetic patients had a significantly higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia (86.9%, P = .020). In terms of complications and clinical outcomes, the incidence of respiratory failure (36.9% vs 24.2%, P = .022), acute cardiac injury (47.4% vs 21.2%, P < .01), and death (20.2% vs 8.0%, P = .001) in the diabetes group was significantly higher than that in the nondiabetes group. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a shorter overall survival time. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that diabetes (hazard ratio 2.180, P = .031) was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 prognosis. In subgroup analysis, we divided diabetic patients into insulin-required and non-insulin-required groups according to whether they needed insulin, and found that diabetic patients requiring insulin may have a higher risk of disease progression and worse prognosis after the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

This retrospective observational study assessed the volume of stroke cases managed in the Emergency Department (ED) and reperfusion therapies in an Italian stroke network with a high incidence of COVID-19, particularly to evaluate if the in-hospital rerouting and the switch from a drip-and-ship to a mothership model could assure an adequate volume of acute treatments. Method(s): We compared data from March 2020 with those from previous years and formulated five PICO questions regarding (1) incidence of stroke cases in the ED; (2) relation between stroke cases and COVID-19; (3) differences in the number of reperfusion therapies, (4) in the call-to-needle and door-to-needle times for intravenous thrombolysis, and (5) in the call-to-groin and door-to-groin times for thrombectomy. Result(s): We found (1) a 28% decreased of confirmed stroke cases managed in the ED, (2) a negative correlation between stroke cases in ED and COVID-19 progression (rs = -.390, p =.030), and (3) a similar number of treatments in March 2020 and March 2019. The adoption of the mothership model (4) did not delay alteplase infusion (median call-to-needle p =.126, median door-to-needle p =.142) but led to (5) a significant reduction in median call-to-groin (p =.018) and door-to-groin times (p =.010).

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 from the pediatric emergency physician's point of view,Simon Junior H.; Sakano T.M.S.; Rodrigues R.M.; Eisencraft A.P.; Carvalho V.E.L.D.; Schvartsman C.; Reis A.G.A.D.C. ,"Objective: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rare and challenging diagnosis requiring early treatment. The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric emergency care flowchart. Sources: The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published through July 3, 2020. The reference lists of the selected articles were manually searched to identify any additional articles. Summary of the findings: COVID-19 infection is less severe in children than in adults, but can present as MIS-C, even in patients without comorbidities. There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C can develop weeks after COVID-19 infection, suggesting an immunomediated cause. The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy are common laboratory findings. Supportive treatment and early immunomodulation can control the intense inflammatory response and reduce complications and mortality. Conclusion(s): MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is serious, rare, and potentially fatal.

Vaccinomic approach for novel multi epitopes vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"Almofti, Yassir A; Abd-Elrahman, Khoubieb Ali; Eltilib, Elsideeq E M","BACKGROUND: The spread of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and other countries is of great concern worldwide with no effective vaccine. This study aimed to design a novel vaccine construct against SARS-CoV-2 from the spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein using immunoinformatics tools. The vaccine was designed from conserved epitopes interacted against B and T lymphocytes by the combination of highly immunogenic epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers., RESULTS: The proposed vaccine composed of 526 amino acids and was shown to be antigenic in Vaxigen server (0.6194) and nonallergenic in Allertop server. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine showed isoelectric point of 10.19. The instability index (II) was 31.25 classifying the vaccine as stable. Aliphatic index was 84.39 and the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was - 0.049 classifying the vaccine as hydrophilic. Vaccine tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated to assess the stability of the vaccine via Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web servers. Moreover, solubility of the vaccine construct was greater than the average solubility provided by protein sol and SOLpro servers indicating the solubility of the vaccine construct. Disulfide engineering was performed to reduce the high mobile regions in the vaccine to enhance stability. Docking of the vaccine construct with TLR4 demonstrated efficient binding energy with attractive binding energy of - 338.68 kcal/mol and - 346.89 kcal/mol for TLR4 chain A and chain B respectively. Immune simulation significantly provided high levels of immunoglobulins, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells and INF-gamma. Upon cloning, the vaccine protein was reverse transcribed into DNA sequence and cloned into pET28a(+) vector to ensure translational potency and microbial expression., CONCLUSION: A unique vaccine construct from spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein against B and T lymphocytes was generated with potential protection against the pandemic.

Natural and human environment interactively drive spread pattern of COVID-19: A city-level modeling study in China,Wu X.; Yin J.; Li C.; Xiang H.; Lv M.; Guo Z. ,"A novel Coronavirus COVID-19 has caused high morbidity and mortality in China and worldwide. A few studies have explored the impact of climate change or human activity on the disease incidence in China or a city. The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector; the impact of effective factors and interaction terms on COVID-19 is simulated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The results find that mean temperature (MeanT), destination proportion in population flow from Wuhan (WH), migration scale (MS), and WH*MeanT, are generally promoting for COVID-19 incidence before Wuhan's shutdown (T1); the WH and MeanT play a determinant role in the disease spread in T1. The effect of environment on COVID-19 incidence after Wuhan's shutdown (T2) includes more factors (including mean DEM, relative humidity, precipitation (Pre), travel intensity within a city (TC), and their interactive terms) than T1, and their effect shows distinct spatial heterogeneity. Interestingly, the dividing line of positive-negative effect of MeanT and Pre on COVID-19 incidence is 8.5degreeC and 1 mm, respectively. In T2, WH has weak impact, but the MS has the strongest effect.

A statistical analysis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy and Spain.,"Chu, Jeffrey","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was first reported at the end of 2019 has impacted almost every aspect of life as we know it. This paper focuses on the incidence of the disease in Italy and Spain-two of the first and most affected European countries. Using two simple mathematical epidemiological models-the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and the log-linear regression model, we model the daily and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the two countries during the early stage of the outbreak, and compute estimates for basic measures of the infectiousness of the disease including the basic reproduction number, growth rate, and doubling time. Estimates of the basic reproduction number were found to be larger than 1 in both countries, with values being between 2 and 3 for Italy, and 2.5 and 4 for Spain. Estimates were also computed for the more dynamic effective reproduction number, which showed that since the first cases were confirmed in the respective countries the severity has generally been decreasing. The predictive ability of the log-linear regression model was found to give a better fit and simple estimates of the daily incidence for both countries were computed.",2021,/,PloS one,16,3,e0249037,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249037,33765088,#91063,Chu 2021,"",""
In the long shadow of our best intentions: Model-based assessment of the consequences of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Johnson, Kaitlyn E; Stoddard, Madison; Nolan, Ryan P; White, Douglas E; Hochberg, Natasha S; Chakravarty, Arijit","As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.",2021,/,PloS one,16,3,e0248509,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248509,33765026,#91062,Johnson 2021,"",""
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Presentations to a pediatric emergency department in Michigan,Sethuraman U.; Kannikeswaran N.; Ang J.; Singer A.; Miller J.; Haddad R.; Stankovic C. ,"The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global pandemic since December 2019. More than 35 million people have been affected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than one million deaths worldwide. Michigan was one of the top three states in the United States that was severely affected by the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic with more than 7000 deaths in adults and greater than 145,000 confirmed infections. However, compared to adults, the majority of children until recently were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness with SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a rare but potentially serious presentation associated with SARS-CoV-2 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been recently reported and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a case definition for the same. We report the clinical and laboratory presentations and outcomes of 34 children with MIS-C who were evaluated within a 12 week period at a pediatric emergency department (PED) of single institution in Michigan. These cases presented approximately three weeks after the peak of adult SAR-CoV-2 related deaths occurred in the state. While many children presented with clinical characteristics similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD), they also exhibited certain unique features which differentiated MIS-C from KD.

No evidence of increasing COVID-19 in health care workers after implementation of high flow nasal cannula: A safety evaluation,Westafer L.M.; Soares W.E.; Salvador D.; Medarametla V.; Schoenfeld E.M. ,"Background: Initial recommendations discouraged high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in COVID-19 patients, driven by concern for healthcare worker (HCW) exposure. Noting high morbidity and mortality from early invasive mechanical ventilation, we implemented a COVID-19 respiratory protocol employing HFNC in severe COVID-19 and HCW exposed to COVID-19 patients on HFNC wore N95/KN95 masks. Utilization of HFNC increased significantly but questions remained regarding HCW infection rate. Method(s): We performed a retrospective evaluation of employee infections in our healthcare system using the Employee Health Services database and unit records of employees tested between March 15, 2020 and May 23, 2020. We assessed the incidence of infections before and after the implementation of the protocol, stratifying by clinical or non-clinical role as well as inpatient COVID-19 unit. Result(s): During the study period, 13.9% (228/1635) of employees tested for COVID-19 were positive. Forty-six percent of infections were in non-clinical staff. After implementation of the respiratory protocol, the proportion of positive tests in clinical staff (41.5%) was not higher than that in non-clinical staff (43.8%). Of the clinicians working in the high-risk COVID-19 unit, there was no increase in infections after protocol implementation compared with clinicians working in COVID-19 units that did not use HFNC.

Methods This is a retrospective single-center study of patients younger than 21 years presenting between March 1 and May 15, 2020. Included patients met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C (inflammation, fever, involvement of 2 organ systems, lack of alternative diagnoses). We defined 3 subgroups by clinical outcomes: (1) critical illness requiring intensive care interventions; (2) patients meeting Kawasaki disease (KD) criteria but not requiring critical care; and (3) mild illness not meeting either criteria. A comparator cohort included patients with KD at our institution during the same time frame in 2019. Results Thirty-three patients were included (5, critical; 8, 2020 KD; 20, mild). The median age for the critical group was 10.9 years (2.7 for 2020 KD; 6.0 for mild, P = 0.033). The critical group had lower median absolute lymphocyte count (850 vs 3005 vs 2940/uL, P = 0.005), platelets (150 vs 361 vs 252 k/uL, P = 0.005), and sodium (129 vs 136 vs 136 mmol/L, P = 0.002), and higher creatinine (0.7 vs 0.2 vs 0.3 mg/dL, P = 0.002). In the critical group, 60% required vasoactive medications, and 40% required mechanical ventilation. Clinical and laboratories features were similar between the 2020 and 2019 KD groups.

Both episodes led to mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method(s): SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimens. Reinfection was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. Kinetics of total anti-S receptor binding domain immunoglobulins (Ig anti-S RBD), anti-nucleoprotein (anti-N) and neutralizing antibodies were determined in serial serum samples retrieved during both infection episodes. Memory B-cell responses were assessed at day 12 after reinfection. Result(s): Whole-genome sequencing identified two different SARS-CoV-2 genomes both belonging to clade 20A, with only one nonsynonymous mutation in the spike protein and clustered with viruses circulating in Geneva (Switzerland) at the time of each of the corresponding episodes. Seroconversion was documented with low levels of total Ig anti-S RBD and anti-N antibodies at 1 month after the first infection, whereas neutralizing antibodies quickly declined after the first episode and then were boosted by the reinfection, with high titres detectable 4 days after symptom onset. A strong memory B-cell response was detected at day 12 after onset of symptoms during reinfection, indicating that the first episode elicited cellular memory responses. Conclusion(s): Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies may put medical personnel at risk of reinfection, as shown in this case. However, reinfection leads to a significant boosting of previous immune responses.

We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses., METHODS: We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, symptom checking, and test cost on outcomes including case reduction and false positives., FINDINGS: Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32., INTERPRETATION: A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay.

We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiation therapy at our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods and Materials: Chest CT images were proposed during radiation therapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System classification. Nasal swabs with RT-PCR assay were initially proposed in cases of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiation therapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. Result(s): From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, and 313 patients had both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-7.8; 26 of 480 patients). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before radiation therapy for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases in which the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible, out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisitions. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated at 0.82 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), respectively. Adaptation of the radiation therapy treatment was made for all patients, with 7 postponed treatments (median: 5 days; interquartile range, 1.5-14.8).

A total of 101 severe and critical patients with coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in this open, case-control, multicenter, prospective study. According to the patients' and their families' willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment (n = 50), while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment (n = 51). Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28-day mortality rate, were collected and analyzed. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre-treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices etc. showed no difference between the two groups. Cytokine storm was detected, with a significant increase of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level. The serum IL-6 level decreased from 119.94 to 20.49 pg/mL in the treatment group and increased from 40.42 to 50.81 pg/mL in the control group (P <.05), indicating that artificial liver therapy significantly decreased serum IL-6. The median duration of viral nucleic acid persistence was 19 days in the treatment group (ranging from 6 to 67 days) and 17 days in the control group (ranging from 3 to 68 days), no significant difference was observed (P =.36). As of 28-day follow-up,17 patients in the treatment group experienced a median weaning time of 24 days, while 11 patients in the control group experienced a median weaning time of 35 days, with no significant difference between the two groups (P =.33).

COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on modified vaccinia virus ankara expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induce robust T- And B-Cell immune responses and full efficacy in mice,Garcia-Arriaza J.; Garaigorta U.; Perez P.; Lazaro-Frias A.; Zamora C.; Gastaminza P.; Del Fresno C.; Casasnovas J.M.; Sorzano C.O.S.; Sancho D.; Esteban M. ,"Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, are urgently needed. We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad, and polyfunctional S-specific CD41 (mainly Th1) and CD81 T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic. IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of 23 December 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs.

Perspectives of US Youth During Initial Month of the COVID-19 Pandemic,Waselewski E.; Waselewski M.; Harper C.; Dickey S.; Bell S.A.; Chang T. ,"PURPOSE: Asymptomatic youth in the United States acting as ""silent spreaders"" during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are an ongoing public health concern, particularly given their depiction as unengaged with recommendations. Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14-24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULT(S): Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020. CONCLUSION(S): Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing.

The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) results, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results Among 104 workers tested, 21 (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six per cent positive cases were asymptomatic. Employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 5.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 24.8) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after adjustments. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (ie, GAD-7 score >4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.99) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Workers commuting by foot, bike or private cars were less likely to screen positive for depression (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.7). Conclusions In this single store sample, we found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct customer exposure were five times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Pilot Trial of Dronabinol Adjunctive Treatment of Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease (THC-AD),Outen J.; Rosenberg P.; Vandrey R.; Amjad H.; Burhanullah H.; Agronin M.; Castaneda R.; Isesalaya M.; Walsh P.; Ash E.; Cohen L.; Wilkins J.; Harper D.; Forester B. ,"Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging (70%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in AD are a major cause of burden to patients, caregivers, and society and are near-universal at some point in the AD course (97%). One of the most troubling NPS is agitation (Agit-AD), typified by a variety of problem behaviors including combativeness, yelling, pacing, lack of cooperation with care, insomnia, and restlessness. Neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to Agit-AD include brain atrophy, degradation of neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, disrupted circadian rhythms, comorbidities, and frailty. There is a great need for better interventions that target Agit-AD, which is a major source of disease progression, patient disability, financial burden, and caregiver stress. Dronabinol is synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, one of the predominant biochemical constituents of cannabis) and is FDA approved for anorexia and nausea. Cannabinoids may improve Agit-AD by providing protection against neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity, regulating neurotransmitters, improving comorbidities, stabilizing circadian rhythms, and increasing cerebral blood flow. This pilot trial could open the door to ""re-purposing"" dronabinol as a novel and safe treatment for Agit-AD with significant public health impact. Method(s): THC-AD is a three-week placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of dronabinol (10 mg QD) in 80 patients with severe Agit-AD. Capsules of dronabinol contain 2.5 mg per dose (5 mg daily) during Week 1, then increase to 5 mg per dose (10 mg daily) for Weeks 2 and 3. The half-life of dronabinol is ~4 hours, so study medication is administered BID at 08:00 and 14:00 to maximize daytime coverage for agitation and to minimize sundowning. Inclusionary criteria include a diagnosis of AD, severe agitation as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C), and being 60-95 years old, while exclusionary criteria include serious or unstable medical illness, seizure disorder, delirium, current use of lithium, and inability to swallow a pill. Primary outcomes are a change in the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale and NPI-C Agitation/Aggression subscales. Secondary outcomes are measures of agitation, cognition, sleep, and global functioning as determined by the following assessments: the NPI-C, Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Clinical Global Impression of Change, Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Severe Impairment Battery (8 item), and subjective and observer-rated drug effects. Safety outcomes include monitoring for adverse events (AEs), weekly health assessments, EKG changes, incident delirium (Confusion Assessment Method), and changes in laboratory values. DNA specimens are collected to explore cannabinoid receptor polymorphisms that may affect response to dronabinol. Serum samples are collected to examine the association of peripheral markers of inflammation with agitation and response to dronabinol. Concomitant medications are limited to currently used antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, as well as anticonvulsant therapy when not used for seizure disorder. PRN rescue medications include total daily doses up to 0.75 mg of lorazepam and 100 mg of trazodone. Result(s): We have enrolled 37 out of 80 participants (Table 1: mean age 78.2 years, 78.4% female, 83.8% Caucasian, mean education 13.2 years, 48.6% family history). Study participants are significantly cognitively impaired (Table 2: mean baseline MMSE of 7.1), agitated (mean NPI-C Agitation 14.8, mean NPI-C Aggression 6.4) and in reasonable overall health (Figure 1: General Medical Health Rating, 10.8% ""excellent,"" 48.6% ""good"" and 40.5% ""fair""). Recorded AEs have been tolerable (Figure 2). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our inpatient trial to include outpatient enrollments and implemented hybrid visits with telemedicine to limit in-person interactions. To bolster our recruitment, we are collaborating with additional clinical sites, increasing dementia bed capacity, and deploying recruitment strategies for outpatients, including referrals from providers and other research trials, social media ads, and virtual community outreach. Updated results will be presented at AAGP (estimated 6-10 additional participants). Conclusion(s): Agitation is one of the most common behavioral manifestations of AD and is associated with greater caregiver burden and shorter time to institutionalization. Current treatments for Agit-AD have a plethora of safety limitations, and there is a particularly acute need for interventions for severe Agit-AD in advanced dementia. One important question for treatment development is whether Agit-AD represents a specific target for intervention or a nonspecific syndrome shared with many other diseases. This clinical trial may enable us to understand if targeting the cannabinoid system will be a safe and effective approach to treat this global health concern.

Similarities and differences between the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19-related pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome and Kawasaki disease,Esteve-Sole A.; Anton J.; Pino-Ramirez R.M.; Sanchez-Manubens J.; Fumado V.; Fortuny C.; Rios-Barnes M.; Sanchez-De-Toledo J.; Girona-Alarcon M.; Manuel Mosquera J.; Ricart S.; Launes C.; Fernandez de Sevilla M.; Jou C.; Munoz-Almagro C.; Gonzalez-Roca E.; Vergara A.; Carrillo J.; Juan M.; Cuadras D.; Noguera-Julian A.; Jordan I.; Alsina L. ,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has recently been described in children (MIS-C), partially overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD). We hypothesized that (a) MIS-C and prepandemic KD cytokine profiles may be unique and justify the clinical differences observed, and (b) SARS-CoV-2-specific immune complexes (ICs) may explain the immunopathology of MIS-C. Seventy-four children were included: 14 with MIS-C, 9 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR without MIS-C (COVID), 14 with prepandemic KD, and 37 healthy controls (HCs). Thirty-four circulating cytokines were quantified in pretreatment serum or plasma samples and the presence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 ICs was evaluated in MIS-C patients. Compared with HCs, the MIS-C and KD groups showed most cytokines to be significantly elevated, with IFN-gamma-induced response markers (including IFN-gamma, IL-18, and IP-10) and inflammatory monocyte activation markers (including MCP-1, IL-1alpha, and IL-1RA) being the main triggers of inflammation. In linear discriminant analysis, MIS-C and KD profiles overlapped; however, a subgroup of MIS-C patients (MIS-Cplus) differentiated from the remaining MIS-C patients in IFN-gamma, IL-18, GM-CSF, RANTES, IP-10, IL-1alpha, and SDF-1 and incipient signs of macrophage activation syndrome. Circulating SARS-CoV-2 ICs were not detected in MIS-C patients. Our findings suggest a major role for IFN-gamma in the pathogenesis of MIS-C, which may be relevant for therapeutic management.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

Friendly Calls to Seniors: an Interprofessional Student Volunteer Program,Nathanson M.; Rau S.; Jiang E.; Phyllis S. ,"Introduction: Older adults compose a segment of the population who are especially vulnerable to loneliness and isolation and have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[1],[2],[3],[4] Evidence shows traditional social support programs enhance their health and well-being; the current pandemic provides an opportunity to understand the potential benefits of virtual social support.[5],[6] Friendly Calls to Seniors (FCS) is an interprofessional student volunteer program that is part of Columbia University's COVID-19 Student Service Corps (CSSC), founded at the outset of the pandemic. Utilizing a script developed by student leaders and faculty advisors from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), volunteers regularly call older adults with underlying mental health conditions. The calls provide social support and opportunities to identify and refer health concerns to care providers, thereby addressing both medical and social needs this group faces, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): FCS is a phone call-based social support program in which student volunteers provide companionship and conduct health risk assessments for interested clients, who are older adults with underlying psychiatric conditions referred by clinical providers in the Washington Heights region of Manhattan. Student volunteers are on-boarded, HIPAA-trained, and supervised by two student leaders, as well as two faculty members of CUIMC, a geriatric psychiatrist and an occupational therapist. Volunteers use a HIPAA-compliant platform to securely call clients, using a translator if necessary. Calls are conducted using a script, which includes a suggested introduction, sample conversational topics, and a risk assessment for health and functioning that incorporates psychiatric and occupational considerations. The script also includes an escalation flowchart to refer client issues to the attention of the faculty supervisors to be connected with social workers, medical professionals, or community resources. Calls are tracked through secure survey forms and project metrics are tabulated weekly. The volunteer team convenes in weekly Zoom meetings to review volunteer-client interactions and pose questions that may have arisen. The project has integrated educational workshops from other organizations such as Columbia's Narrative Medicine Program. The student and faculty leadership also collaborates with community-based organizations and naturally occurring retirement communities (NORCs) in the Washington Heights region. Result(s): At the time of writing, a total of 400 calls have been made by FCS student volunteers to 72 unique clients, ranging in age from 61 to 96. Of these, 38 are English-speaking and 34 are Spanish speaking; 49 clients elected to continue receiving calls. All clients have existing mental and physical health conditions, including depression, anxiety, neurocognitive disorders, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. Medical comorbidities, which were highly prevalent, existing in 45% of clients, included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In total, 48 escalations have been made since the start of the program. Table 1 displays a breakdown of the escalation reasons: There have been 41 total volunteers since the program's inception, of whom 18 are currently active. The volunteers represent a wide range of health professions and undergraduate programs at Columbia, as seen in Table 2. Qualitative volunteer feedback about FCS was obtained through call log responses and reflection sessions. Volunteers cited increased knowledge of community resources and improved skills in relationship-building and addressing geriatric-specific concerns, such as discussing mental health concerns in an age-attuned and culturally sensitive manner. Additional skills gained included the ability to properly coordinate with an interpreter and communicate across language barriers; many students had never worked with an interpreter prior to being a part of FCS. Conclusion(s): The FCS program exhibits promising qualitative results supporting vulnerable older adults. Using a script with a systematic risk assessment, volunteers have performed regular outreach to seniors and referred them to appropriate social services and/or healthcare professionals as needed. Clients and the FCS team have mutually benefited from the interprofessional perspectives informing this program, which have led to improved understanding of professional roles, available community resources, and opportunities for comprehensive care. Looking ahead, FCS will continue to be relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic draws on and many seniors remain socially isolated. The team will develop quantitative outcome metrics to better understand the impact of its work. The interprofessional, community-based education model, exemplified by the FCS interprofessional project, will be developed as a generalizable model for ensuring quality of care and best practice.

Treatment potential and cost projection regarding use of icatibant or lanadelumab for therapy of COVID-19 associated respiratory distress syndrome,Osmic D.; Likic R. ,"Introduction/background &aims: Icatibant (Firazyr ) and lanadelumab (Takhzyro ) are drugs used in the treatment of hereditary angioedema, a condition caused by the deficiency of C1-esterase leading to increased bradykinin production, elevated vascular permeability and vasodilatation. Icatibant is a selective competitive antagonist of bradykinin receptor type 2 (B2) and lanadelumab is a human monoclonal antibody against active plasma kallikrein. Method/summary of work: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients may be caused by a shortage of ACE2, found on lung cells' surface and utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. In accordance with de Veerdonk's hypothesis that bradykinin surplus leads to clinical deterioration of severely ill COVID-19 patients, bradykinin and kallikrein inhibitors could be of use in the treatment of such cases. ACE and ACE2 work by inhibiting B2 receptor and des-Arg9-BK, respectively, thus constraining binding to B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors and reducing vascular leakage. SARSCov-2 may be directly responsible for pulmonary angioedema through downregulation of ACE2 expression. By mimicking ACE and ACE2 role in vascular leakage, drugs such as icatibant and lanadelumab could prevent pulmonary vascular leakage in COVID-19 patients. Results/discussion: The projected cost of treatment proposed in accordance with de Veerdonk's hypothesis for one COVID-19 patient for icatibant is priced at 1.395,00 per 30 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe and for lanadelumab at 12.420,00 per 300 mu g vial. Icatibant is used only in the acute setting up to a maximum total dose of 90 mg daily, while lanadelumab is used every two weeks in a chronic setting for prevention of edema. From January 31 to September 3, 2020, the average daily number of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom was 1902 +/- 123 (mean +/- SD), with a median of 1182. If around 5% of the daily diagnosed patients require ICU admission for respiratory support, that would amount to 95 +/- 6.2 (median 59) patients potentially being treated with either up to 90 mg of icatibant daily or 300 mg of lanadelumab once every 2 weeks, amounting to a projected daily expenditure of 397.575,00 +/- 25.947,00 (median 246.915,00) for icatibant vs.  1.179.900,00 +/- 77.004,00 (median 732.780,00) for lanadelumab. Conclusion(s): While efficacy and safety of both drugs in treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients need to be confirmed in rigorous randomized controlled trials, assuming the medicines' equal efficacy and safety profiles and lack of additional price discounts/rebates, icatibant appears to offer greater dosing flexibility and thereby improved expenditure control.

COVID-19 Among US Dialysis Patients: Risk Factors and Outcomes From a National Dialysis Provider,Hsu C.M.; Weiner D.E.; Aweh G.; Miskulin D.C.; Manley H.J.; Stewart C.; Ladik V.; Hosford J.; Lacson E.C.; Johnson D.S.; Lacson E. ,"Rationale & Objective: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients receiving maintenance dialysis are a highly vulnerable population due to their comorbidities and circumstances that limit physical distancing during treatment. This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 in this population. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting & Participants: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics of a midsize national dialysis provider that had at least 1 patient who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from February to June 2020. Predictors: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregated setting, comorbid conditions, measurements of frailty, and use of selected medications. Outcome(s): COVID-19, defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. Analytical Approach: Logistic regression analyses conducted to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. Result(s): 438 of 7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 were 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregated setting (odds ratio [OR], 17.10 [95% CI, 13.51-21.54]). Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. Limitation(s): No distinction was detected between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings.

Aim(s): To assess the epidemiological and clinical outcome of close contacts of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) cases admitted in a tertiary COVID hospital and to assess the role of risk factors in predicting the epidemiological outcome of these contacts. Material(s) and Method(s): The current retrospective cohort study was conducted among 1286 close contacts of COVID-19 patients admitted to Government Medical College, Thrissur, Kerala. The data collection was done by a semi-structured telephonic interview by the contact tracing team. The questions included the type of exposure to the index case, symptoms if any, date of last exposure with COVID-19 patient, and final COVID-19 status of the contact at the end of 14 days. The association of risk factors of COVID-19 positivity was done using binary logistic regression. Result(s): Proportion of close contacts of COVID-19 who developed the disease was 24.2% (21.87-26.52%). The mean incubation period was found to be 4.22 days (C.I-3.71-4.65). The serial interval was found to be a mean of 5.24 days (C.I 4.764-5.716). The proportion of household contacts of COVID-19 cases who developed the disease was found to be 26% (C.I-23%-29%). The majority (52.4%) of infections among contacts were asymptomatic. Most common symptom among the COVID-19 +ve was fever (32.8%) followed by cough (16.1%). The most common risk factors of infection among primary close contacts were sharing the same room (adjusted odds ratio-2.394) and common use of fomites (adjusted odds ratio-1.953) while use of a mask was found to be protective (adjusted odds ratio-0.570). Significant factors associated with the type of contact with infection were workplace-related contact (adjusted odds ratio-6.629), household contact (adjusted odds ratio-4.856), and travel-related contact (adjusted odds ratio-2.899). Conclusion(s): The study concludes important risk factors of transmission among close contacts of COVID-19 as being in a household, workplace and travel related contact where the use of mask was found to be protective. The study also concludes that most of the COVID-19 infections in close contacts are asymptomatic.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

"Tuberculosis - United States, 2020.","Deutsch-Feldman, Molly; Pratt, Robert H; Price, Sandy F; Tsang, Clarisse A; Self, Julie L","Tuberculosis (TB) disease incidence has decreased steadily since 1993 (1), a result of decades of work by local TB programs to detect, treat, and prevent TB disease and transmission. During 2020, a total of 7,163 TB cases were provisionally reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) by the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC), a relative reduction of 20%, compared with the number of cases reported during 2019.* TB incidence per 100,000 persons was 2.2 during 2020, compared with 2.7 during 2019. Since 2010, TB incidence has decreased by an average of 2%-3% annually (1). Pandemic mitigation efforts and reduced travel might have contributed to the reported decrease. The magnitude and breadth of the decrease suggest potentially missed or delayed TB diagnoses. Health care providers should consider TB disease when evaluating patients with signs and symptoms consistent with TB (e.g., cough of >2 weeks in duration, unintentional weight loss, and hemoptysis), especially when diagnostic tests are negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, members of the public should be encouraged to follow up with their health care providers for any respiratory illness that persists or returns after initial treatment.

Clustering Patterns Connecting COVID-19 Dynamics and Human Mobility Using Optimal Transport.,"Nielsen, Frank; Marti, Gautier; Ray, Sumanta; Pyne, Saumyadipta","Social distancing and stay-at-home are among the few measures that are known to be effective in checking the spread of a pandemic such as COVID-19 in a given population. The patterns of dependency between such measures and their effects on disease incidence may vary dynamically and across different populations. We described a new computational framework to measure and compare the temporal relationships between human mobility and new cases of COVID-19 across more than 150 cities of the United States with relatively high incidence of the disease. We used a novel application of Optimal Transport for computing the distance between the normalized patterns induced by bivariate time series for each pair of cities. Thus, we identified 10 clusters of cities with similar temporal dependencies, and computed the Wasserstein barycenter to describe the overall dynamic pattern for each cluster.

"""Silent Hypoxemia"" Leads to Vicious Cycle of Infection, Coagulopathy and Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: Can Prophylactic Oxygen Therapy Prevent It?.","Chauhan, Anshika; Kaur, Rajandeep; Chakrbarti, Prantar; Pal, Arnab","Humankind is facing its worst pandemic of the twenty-first century, due to infection of a novel coronavirus named as SARS-CoV2, started from Wuhan in China. Till now, 15 million people are infected, causing more than 600,000 deaths. The disease, commonly known as, COVID-19, was initially thought to be associated with ARDS only, but later on revealed to have many unexplained and atypical clinical features like coagulopathy and cytokinemia, leading to multi-organ involvements. The patients also suffer from 'Silent Hypoxemia', where there is no immediate respiratory signs and symptoms even though alarmingly low SpO2 level. We hypothesize that this covert hypoxemia may lead to molecular changes exacerbating coagulopathy and cytokine storm in COVID19 patients, which again, in turn, causes a vicious cycle of more hypoxemia/hypoxia and progression of the infection to more severe stages through HIF-1alpha dependent pathway. Although molecular mechanisms are yet to be substantiated by scientific evidence, hypoxemia remains an independent worsening factor in serious COVID 19 patients. Keeping all in mind, we propose that even in the early and asymptomatic cases, prophylactic oxygen therapy to be initiated to break the vicious cycle and to reduce the mortality in COVID 19 to save precious human lives.

COVID-19 and Parkinson's Disease: What We Know So Far?.,"Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Romagnolo, Alberto; Ledda, Claudia; Zibetti, Maurizio; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Montanaro, Elisa; Bozzali, Marco; Lopiano, Leonardo","BACKGROUND: Many studies on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients affected by Coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) were recently published. However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population., METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19., RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors., CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population. Conversely, current literature does not definitively clarify whether PD patients are more susceptible to get infected.

Prevalence of Internet-based addictive behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.,"Masaeli, Nassim; Farhadi, Hadi","With the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many countries have imposed lockdowns which have caused an increase in Internet use. As large-scale disasters may have an impact on addictions, a review on Internet-based addictive behaviors seems necessary. The goals of this review are to find whether Internet-based addictive behaviors have increased during the pandemic and to define the main reasons for this increase. The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals' exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The articles found in this review proved an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to financial hardships, isolation, problematic substance use, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress.

Cyanobacterial natural products as sources for antiviral drug discovery against COVID-19.,"Jafari Porzani, Samaneh; Konur, Ozcan; Nowruzi, Bahareh","The recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), positive-sense RNA viruses, originated from Wuhan City in December 2019 and propagated widely globally. Hence, the disease caused by this virus has been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. As of 18th February 2021, at least seven different vaccines across three platforms have been rolled out in countries and more than 200 additional vaccine candidates have been in development, of which more than 60 are at the stage of the clinical development. So far, Most of the approved vaccine manufacturers are Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Serum Institute of India, which have been finalized by WHO. Synthetic drug-associated complications have evoked scientific attention for natural product-based drugs. There has been a surge in the antiviral compounds from natural resources along with some therapies. Cyanobacteria are the fruitful reservoir of many metabolites like sulfated polysaccharides and lectins that possess strong antiviral activities and immunity boosting effects. However, the research in this field has been relatively under-developed. The current research highlights important features of cyanobacterial antiviral biomaterials, benefits and drawbacks of cyanobacterial drugs, challenges, future perspectives as well as overview of drugs against COVID-19. In addition, we have described mutated variants and transmission rate of coronaviruses.

Inhaled vaccine delivery in the combat against respiratory viruses: a 2021 overview of recent developments and implications for COVID-19.,"Heida, Rick; Hinrichs, Wouter Lj; Frijlink, Henderik W","Introduction: As underlined by the late 2019 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccination remains the cornerstone of global health-care. Although vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at a record-breaking pace, the majority of those that are licensed or currently registered in clinical trials are formulated as an injectable product, requiring a tightly regulated cold-chain infrastructure, and primarily inducing systemic immune responses. Areas covered: Here, we shed light on the status of inhaled vaccines against viral pathogens, providing background to the role of the mucosal immune system and elucidating what factors determine an inhalable vaccine's efficacy. We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Expert opinion: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.",2021,/,Expert review of vaccines,,101155475,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1903878,33749491,#91134,Heida 2021,"",""
Psychological impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on nurses.,"Al Maqbali, Mohammed; Al Khadhuri, Jamal","AIM: The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has laid unprecedented stress on healthcare workers and especially nurses. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the contributing factors., METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics R software was performed. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale., RESULTS: Of the 1,130 nurses who participated, 75.6% (n = 854) reported stress, 44.2% (n = 499) reported anxiety, 38.5% (n = 435) reported depression and 73.7% (n = 833) reported poor sleep. Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance (p < .05) were significantly associated with age, marital status, comorbidity and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. The stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance were significantly positively corelated with each other. Logistic regression showed nurses in the age group between 18 and 30, who worked at the frontline, were at a higher risk of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance., CONCLUSIONS: Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance are significant problems for nurses working in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce psychological problems and sleep disturbance among nurses are needed, which can help to support nurses' work during contagious disease outbreaks.

Deterrents in recruitment of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors: Experience from a hospital-based blood centre in India.,"Dhiman, Yashaswi; Coshic, Poonam; Pandey, Hem Chandra; Khatiwada, Basanta; Singh, Jasmeet; Mehta, Vikas; Gupta, Sanjay","INTRODUCTION: Recruitment of Covid-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors may present as a challenge due to inexperience and differences in donor profile as compared to whole blood donation. Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed., RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery., CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.

Influenza vaccination: a 'shot' at INVESTing in cardiovascular health.,"Bhatt, Ankeet S; Vardeny, Orly; Udell, Jacob A; Joseph, Jacob; Kim, KyungMann; Solomon, Scott D","The link between viral respiratory infection and non-pulmonary organ-specific injury, including cardiac injury, has become increasingly appreciated during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Even prior to the pandemic, however, the association between acute infection with influenza and elevated cardiovascular risk was evident. The recently published results of the NHLBI-funded INfluenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop CardioThoracic Events and Decompensated (INVESTED) trial, a 5200 patient comparative effectiveness study of high-dose vs. standard-dose influenza vaccine to reduce cardiopulmonary events and mortality in a high-risk cardiovascular population, found no difference between strategies. However, the broader implications of influenza vaccine as a strategy to reduce morbidity in high-risk patients remain extremely important, with randomized controlled trial and observational data supporting vaccination in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Given a favourable risk-benefit profile and widespread availability at generally low cost, we contend that influenza vaccination should remain a centrepiece of cardiovascular risk mitigation and describe the broader context of underutilization of this strategy. Few therapeutics in medicine offer seasonal efficacy from a single administration with generally mild, transient side effects, and exceedingly low rates of serious adverse effects. Infection control measures such as physical distancing, hand washing, and the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic have already been associated with substantially curtailed incidence of influenza outbreaks across the globe. Appending annual influenza vaccination to these measures represents an important public health and moral imperative. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Outcomes of newborns to mothers with COVID-19.,"Ghema, K; Lehlimi, M; Toumi, H; Badre, A; Chemsi, M; Habzi, A; Benomar, S","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus., METHOD: This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes., RESULTS: Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications., CONCLUSION: Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results. Our study supports the hypothesis that though it seldom actually occurs, in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

QACs are extensively used in SARS-CoV-2 related sanitization in clinical and household settings. Similarly, due to the danger of secondary infections, antibiotic therapeutics are increasingly used as a component of COVID-19 treatment regimens, even in the absence of a bacterial infection diagnosis.

Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an elevated risk of VAP, although susceptibility varies widely.

We employed a combination of tracheal aspirate bulk and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Two days before VAP onset, a lower respiratory transcriptional signature of bacterial infection was observed, characterized by increased expression of neutrophil degranulation, toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling pathways. When assessed at an earlier time point following endotracheal intubation, more than two weeks prior to VAP onset, we observed a striking early impairment in antibacterial innate and adaptive immune signaling that markedly differed from COVID-19 patients who did not develop VAP. scRNA-seq further demonstrated suppressed immune signaling across monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. While viral load did not differ at an early post-intubation timepoint, impaired SARS-CoV-2 clearance and persistent interferon signaling characterized the patients who later developed VAP. Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients who developed VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens.

Why ODE models for COVID-19 fail: Heterogeneity shapes epidemic dynamics,"Grossmann, Gerrit; Backenkoehler, Michael; Wolf, Verena","In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and to guide policy-making. Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population's heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population's heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.",2021,,,,,,PPR303912,10.1101/2021.03.25.21254292,,#93114,Grossmann 2021,"",""

Methods We analyzed the national COVID-19 database that contains data regarding COVID-19 testing, management, and clinical outcomes in Duhok. For this study, different subdistricts within each district of Duhok were considered distinct clusters. Blood samples were collected from and questionnaires were administered to eligible and consenting participants who were members of different families from the subdistricts. Immunoassays were conducted to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the associations between certain variables were investigated. Results The average number cases of COVID-19 before November 2020 was 23141 ± 4364, which was significantly higher than the average number of cases between November 2020 and February 2021 (3737 ± 2634; P = 0.001). A total of 743 individuals agreed to participate and were enrolled in the study. Among the participants, 465/743 (62.58%) were found to have antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Among the participants with antibodies, 262/465 (56.34%) denied having any history of COVID-19-related symptoms. The most common symptom was fever (81.77%), followed by myalgia (81.28%). We found that antibody levels increased steadily with age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.117; P = 0.012). A significant association was found between antibody levels and the presence of symptoms (P = 0.023; odds ratio = 1.0023; 95% confidence interval = 1.0002-1.0061). Conclusions A significant reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases was observed. This might be due to the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Duhok. However, infection-prevention measures should be followed as it remains unclear whether acquired immunity is protective against reinfection. It expected that the infection rates during the next wave will not be as high as the first wave due to the high infection rate in the society.",2021,,,,,,PPR303244,10.1101/2021.03.23.21254169,,#93085,Hussein 2021,"",""
Understanding and Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy in the Context of COVID-19: Development of a Digital intervention,"Knight, Holly; Jia, Ru; Ayling, Kieran; Bradbury, Katherine; Baker, Katherine; Chalder, Trudie; Morling, Joanne; Durrant, Lindy; Avery, Tony; Ball, Jonathan; Barker, Caroline; Bennett, Robert; McKeever, Tricia; vedhara, kavita","<h4>Background: </h4> Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in late 2019, spreading to over 200 countries and resulting in almost two million deaths worldwide. The emergence of safe and effective vaccines provides a route out of the pandemic, with vaccination uptake of 75-90% needed to achieve population protection. Vaccine hesitancy is problematic for vaccine rollout; global reports suggest only 73% of the population may agree to being vaccinated. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop equitable and accessible interventions to address vaccine hesitancy at the population level. Method We report the development of a scalable digital intervention seeking to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and enhance uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. Guided by motivational interviewing (MI) principles, the intervention includes a series of therapeutic dialogues addressing 10 key concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals. Development of the intervention occurred linearly across four stages. During stage 1, we identified common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy through analysis of existing survey data, a rapid systematic literature review, and public engagement workshops. Stage 2 comprised qualitative interviews with medical, immunological, and public health experts. Rapid content and thematic analysis of the data provided evidence-based responses to common vaccine concerns. Stage 3 involved the development of therapeutic dialogues through workshops with psychological and digital behaviour change experts. Dialogues were developed to address concerns using MI principles, including embracing resistance and supporting self-efficacy. Finally, stage 4 involved digitisation of the dialogues and pilot testing with members of the public. Discussion The digital intervention provides an evidence-based approach to addressing vaccine hesitancy through MI principles. The dialogues are user-selected, allowing exploration of relevant issues associated with hesitancy in a non-judgmental context. The text-based content and digital format allow for rapid modification to changing information and scalability for wider dissemination.",2021,,,,,,PPR303238,10.1101/2021.03.24.21254124,,#93084,Knight 2021,"",""

Newly developed vaccines promise relief to people who live in high-income countries, although vaccines and expensive new treatments are unlikely to arrive in time to help people who live in low-and middle-income countries. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.69).

COVID-19 Vaccine's Gender Paradox,"Galasso, Vincenzo; Profeta, Paola; Foucault, Martial; Pons, Vincent","Women die less than men of COVID-19, but have been more concerned about its health consequences and more compliant with the public health rules imposed during the pandemic. Since return to normal life depends on vaccination, but delays in acceptance or outright refusals of vaccination are already evident, we investigate gender differences in attitudes and expected behaviors regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Using original data from a survey conducted in December 2020 in ten developed countries (N=13,326), we discover a COVID-19 Vaccine gender paradox. Being more concerned about COVID-19 and more likely to believe to be infected and consequently to become seriously ill, women could be expected to be more supportive of vaccination than men. Instead, our findings show that women agree less than men to be vaccinated and to make vaccination compulsory. Our evidence suggests that their vaccine hesitance is partly due skepticism, since women are less likely to believe that vaccination is the only solution to COVID-19 and more likely to believe that COVID-19 was created by large corporations. Using a survey experiment performed in these ten countries, we show that information provision on the role of vaccination to become immune to COVID-19 is effective in reducing vaccine hesitance.",2021,,,,,,PPR303216,10.1101/2021.03.26.21254380,,#93082,Galasso 2021,"",""

Understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the main challenges in the past year in order to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis. Comparatively little is known in regard to how the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 differs from other respiratory infections. In our study, we compare the peripheral blood immune signature from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to patients hospitalized pre-pandemic with Influenza Virus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Our in-depth profiling indicates that the immune landscape in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is largely similar to patients hospitalized with Flu or RSV. Similarly, serum cytokine and chemokine expression patterns were largely overlapping. Unique to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who had the most critical clinical disease state were changes in the regulatory T cell (Treg) compartment. A Treg signature including increased frequency, activation status, and migration markers was correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. These findings are particularly relevant as Tregs are being discussed as a therapy to combat the severe inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.

[COVID-19 in children: SARS-CoV-2-related inflammatory multisystem syndrome mimicking Kawasaki disease].,"Mercier, J-C; Maroni, A; Levy, M; Melki, I; Meinzer, U; Gaschignard, J; Beyler, C; Santos, A","SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is characterized by a high level of infectivity and a high mortality among adults at risk (older than 65 years, obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension). Following a common viral pneumonia, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome sometimes occurs, including an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) carrying a high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally develop a mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have been recently described. Both clinical symptoms (i.e., high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctivitis and dry cracked lips) and biological signs (e.g., elevated CRP/PCT, hyperferritinemia) resembled Kawasaki disease. In most instances, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved the cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. However, adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g., anti-IL-1Ra, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2' has been recently described in children and helps to better understand Kawasaki disease pathophysiology.

However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.

In addition, the association of different MS DMTs with the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 was evaluated. Safety data from the Biogen Global Safety Database are also presented on reported cases of COVID-19 in patients treated with Biogen MS therapies., METHODS: The IBM R Explorys electronic health record database of > 72,000,000 patients from US healthcare networks identified patients with MS or SLE, with and without polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization, and deaths among DMT classes were compared using logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity). As a secondary data source to assess safety data, COVID-19 reports for Biogen MS therapies were extracted and described from Biogen's Global Safety Database., RESULTS: 30,478 PwMS with an open DMT prescription were identified within Explorys; 344 were COVID-19 positive. The most significant risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were comorbidity score >= 1, body mass index >= 30, and Black/African ancestry. Similar risk factors were also identified for patients with SLE. Patients with MS were less likely to develop COVID-19 when treated with interferons (0.61%) and glatiramer acetate (0.51%), vs all other MS DMTs (both p < 0.001); anti-CD20 therapy was associated with the highest risk (3.45%; p < 0.0001).

Although steroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and supportive care treatments have been suggested in the literature, there exists no treatment guideline for MIS-A. The clinical and laboratory findings of the patients progressively improved with the implementation of the IVIG and the pulse steroid treatments. A total of 51 cases (>= 18 years-old) with MIS were analyzed. Mean age was 29.4 +/- 10 years. Fever (80.4%), gastrointestinal (72.5%), and respiratory symptoms (54.9%) were the predominant symptoms. Cardiovascular abnormalities were the most frequent reported findings (82.4%, 42/51). The dermatological and conjunctival findings were reported in 39.2% and 35.3% of the patients, respectively. The increased level of inflammatory biomarkers was remarkable. Most of the patients were treated successfully with steroid and IVIG. Clinicians managing adult patients should keep in mind the development risk of MIS related with SARS-CoV-2 infection to perform necessary interventions properly without delay.

"Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in a non-epidemic region, Japan: A hospital-based study on May, 2020.","Nakamura, Akihiro; Ando, Sanae; Endo, Hideaki; Sato, Ryoichi","The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing rate is low in our local area and the true rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may include many asymptomatic individuals. We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1,404 healthcare workers (41 +/- 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. Additionally, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID-19-indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1,404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID-19, even if the PCR testing rate was low. Rapid antibody kits might not be useful due to the high false positive rate in an area with a low incidence of COVID-19 infected individuals. This article is protected by copyright.

Personalized Collection of Plasma from Healthy Donors: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Novel Technology-Enabled Nomogram.,"Hartmann, Jan; Ragusa, Michael J; Burchardt, Elmar R; Manukyan, Zorayr; Popovsky, Mark A; Leitman, Susan F","BACKGROUND: Source plasma is essential to support the growing demand for plasma-derived medicinal products. Supply is short, with donor availability further limited by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined whether a novel, personalized, technology-based nomogram was non-inferior with regard to significant hypotensive adverse events (AEs) in healthy donors., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: IMPACT (IMproving PlasmA CollecTion) was a prospective, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial carried out between January 6 and March 26, 2020 in three U.S. plasma collection centers. Donors were randomized to the current simplified 1992 nomogram (control) or a novel Percent Plasma Nomogram (PPN) with personalized target volume calculation (experimental). Primary endpoint was the rate of significant hypotensive AEs. Non-inferiority (NI) was tested with a margin of 0.15%. Collected plasma volume was a secondary endpoint., RESULTS: 3,443 donors (Mean [SD] BMI: 32 (7.74) kg/m2 ; 65% male) underwent 23,137 donations (Median [range]: 6 [1-22] per subject). Ten significant hypotensive AEs were observed (6 control; 4 experimental), with model-based AE incidence rate estimates (95% CI) of 0.051% (0.020%, 0.114%) and 0.035% (0.010%, 0.094%), respectively (p=0.58). NI was met at an upper limit of 0.043% versus the predefined margin of 0.15%. There was no statistical difference between total AE (all AE types: p=0.32). Mean plasma volume collected was 777.8 mL (control) versus 841.7 mL (experimental); an increase of 63.9 mL per donation (8.2%; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: This trial showed that a novel personalized nomogram approach in healthy donors allowed approximately 8% more plasma per donation to be collected without impairing donor safety.

Despite severe hypogammaglobulinemia, deteriorated T cell counts and neutropenia, the patient unexpectedly combated COVID-19 by balanced response of innate immunity, strong CD8+ and CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation, development of specific T-cell memory subsets, as well as development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 type IgA and IgG antibodies. Even 6 months after re-introduction of lenalidomide maintenance therapy, specific T cell response and antibody levels remained detectable, indicating persisting immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Immunological Aspects Related to Viral Infections in Severe Asthma and the Role of Omalizumab,"Menzella, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Galeone, Carla; Capobelli, Silvia; Scelfo, Chiara; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo","Viral respiratory infections are recognized risk factors for the loss of control of allergic asthma and the induction of exacerbations, both in adults and children. Severe asthma is more susceptible to virus-induced asthma exacerbations, especially in the presence of high IgE levels. In the course of immune responses to viruses, an initial activation of innate immunity typically occurs and the production of type I and III interferons is essential in the control of viral spread. However, the Th2 inflammatory environment still appears to be protective against viral infections in general and in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections as well. As for now, literature data, although very limited and preliminary, show that severe asthma patients treated with biologics don&rsquo;t have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression to severe forms compared to the non-asthmatic population. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, exerts a profound cellular effect, which is able to stabilize the effector cells becoming much more efficient from the point of view of innate immunity in contrasting respiratory viral infections. In addition to the antiviral effect, clinical efficacy and safety of this biological allows a great improvement in the management of asthma.",2021,,,,,,PPR302957,10.20944/preprints202103.0597.v1,,#93061,Menzella 2021,"",""

Arginine methylation of N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated by cell culture. We demonstrate that arginine methylation of N protein is required for its RNA binding capacity, since treatment with a type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95K or R177K inhibited interaction with the 5’-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. We defined the N interactome in HEK293 cells with or without MS023 treatment and identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates including the known interactor, G3BP1, and other components of stress granules (SG). Methylation of N protein at R95 regulates another function namely its property to suppress the formation of SGs. MS023 treatment or R95K substitution blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pre-treatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. With type I PRMT inhibitors being in clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may be an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.",2021,,,,,,PPR302917,10.1101/2021.03.24.436822,,#93056,Cai 2021,"",""
CCR2 Regulates Vaccine-Induced Mucosal T-Cell Memory to Influenza A Virus,"Lee, Woojong; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Kedl, Ross; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Suresh, M","Elicitation of lung tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (T RM s) is a goal of T-cell based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza A virus (IAV). Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 T RM s in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (T C 1/T C 17/T H 1/T H 17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung T RM s, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced T RM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional dendrtitic cells (DCs) and monocyte-derived DCs internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We also found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127 HI /KLRG-1 LO , OX40 +ve CD62L +ve and mucosally imprinted CD69 +ve CD103 +ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung T RM s, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced T RM s. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Importance</h4> While antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.",2021,,,,,,PPR302829,10.1101/2021.03.24.436901,,#93051,Lee 2021,"",""
Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor,"Chen, Chen; Boorla, Veda Sheersh; Banerjee, Deepro; Chowdhury, Ratul; Cavener, Victoria; Nissly, Ruth; Gontu, Abhinay; Boyle, Nina; Vandergrift, Kurt; Nair, Meera Surendran; Kuchipudi, Suresh; Maranas, Costas","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The association of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike with human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) represents the first required step for viral entry. Amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, π-π packing and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single amino-acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple amino-acid changes. This can be a very valuable tool to predict host adaptation and zoonotic spillover of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2021,,,,,,PPR302823,10.1101/2021.03.24.436885,,#93049,Chen 2021,"",""
The attainment of herd immunity with a reducing risk of contact infection in modelling ,"Law, Kian Boon; Peariasamy, Kalaiarasu; Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Abdullah, Noor Hisham","The risk of contact infection among susceptible individuals in a randomly mixed population can be reduced by the presence of immune individuals and this principle forms the fundamental of herd immunity. The conventional susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model features an infection-induced herd immunity model, but does not include the reducing risk of contact infection among susceptible individuals in the transmission model, therefore tends to overestimate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Here we show that the reducing risk of contact infection among susceptible individuals can be achieved by incorporating the proportion of susceptible individuals (model A) or the inverse of proportion of recovered individuals (model B) in the force of infection of the SIR model. We numerically simulated the conventional SIR model and both new SIR models A and B under the exact condition with a basic reproduction number of 3·0. Prior to the numerical simulation, the threshold for the eradication of infectious disease through herd immunity was expected to be 0·667 (66·7%) for all three models. All three models performed likewise at the initial stage of disease transmission. In the conventional SIR model, the infectious disease subsided when 94·0 % of the population had been infected and recovered, way above the expected threshold for eradication and control of the infectious disease. Both models A and B simulated the infectious disease to diminish when 66·7% and 75·6% of the population had been infected, showing herd immunity might protect more susceptible individuals from the infectious disease as compared to the projection generated by the conventional SIR. Our study shows that model A provides a better framework for modelling herd immunity through vaccination, while model B provides a better framework for modelling herd immunity through infection. Both models overcome the insufficiency of the conventional SIR model in attaining the effect of herd immunity in modelling outputs, which is important and relevant for modelling infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 in a randomly mixed population.",2021,,,,,,PPR302681,10.21203/rs.3.rs-289776/v4,,#93046,Law 2021,"",""
Continuity of routine immunization programs in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Sell, Hannah; Assi, Ali; Driedger, Michelle; Dubé, Eve; Gagneur, Arnaud; Meyer, Samantha; Robinson, Joan; Sadarangani, Manish; Tunis, Matthew; MacDonald, Shannon","<h4>Introduction</h4> In Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted many routine health services, placed additional strain on the health care system, and resulted in many Canadians being either unable or unwilling to attend routine immunization appointments. We sought to capture and synthesize information about changes to routine immunization programs in response to the pandemic and plans to catch-up any missed immunizations. <h4>Methods</h4> Provincial/territorial (P/T) public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics: how routine immunization delivery was affected during and after initial lockdown periods, plans to catch-up missed doses, and major challenges and achievements in continuing routine immunization programs. Data were coded and categorized according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. <h4>Results</h4> Interviews occurred with participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. School immunization programs were reported to be most negatively affected by the pandemic ( n =9). In the early pandemic period, infant, preschool, and maternal/prenatal programs were prioritized, with most P/Ts continuing these services with adaptations for COVID-19. After the initial lockdown period, all routine programs were continuing with adaptations in most P/Ts. Infant, preschool, and school programs were most often targeted for catch-up through measures such as appointment rebooking and making additional clinics and/or providers available. Major challenges included resource limitations (e.g., staff shortages, PPE shortages, limited infrastructure) ( n =11), public health restrictions ( n =8), and public hesitancy to attend appointments ( n =5). <h4>Conclusions</h4> Canadian routine immunization programs faced some disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the school, adult, and older adult programs. Further research is needed to determine the measurable impact of the pandemic on routine vaccine coverage levels.",2021,,,,,,PPR303286,10.1101/2021.03.22.21254121,,#93092,Sell 2021,"",""

To estimate exposure and the potential for further spread, we used a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model fit to seroprevalence data from three serosurveys in Delhi and the time-series of reported deaths to reconstruct the epidemic. The cumulative proportion of the population estimated infected was 48.7% (95% CrI 22.1% – 76.8%) by end-September 2020. Using an age-adjusted overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) based on age-specific estimates from mostly high-income countries (HICs), we estimate that 15.0% (95% CrI 9.3% – 34.0%) of COVID-19 deaths were reported. This indicates either under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths and/or a lower age-specific IFR in India compared with HICs. Despite the high attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, a third wave occurred in late 2020, suggesting that herd immunity was not yet reached.

COVID-19 reinfection: A Rapid Systematic Review of Case Reports and Case Series,"Wang, Jingzhou; Kaperak, Christopher; Sato, Toshiro; Sakuraba, Atsushi","The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people worldwide and many countries have been suffering from a large number of deaths. Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity, however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase-chain reaction and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection, but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity, 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms, and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after achieving herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination suggesting the need for longer term transmission mitigation efforts.",2021,,,,,,PPR303280,10.1101/2021.03.22.21254081,,#93090,Wang 2021,"",""

We measured COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induced IgG and IgA in serum serially, up to 80 days post vaccination in 4 subjects. Spike antigen-specific IgG levels rose exponentially and plateaued 21 days after the initial vaccine dose. After the second vaccine dose IgG levels increased further, reaching a maximum approximately 7-10 days later, and remained elevated (average of 78% peak levels) during the additional 20-50 day follow up period. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination elicited spike antigen-specific IgA with similar kinetics of induction and time to peak levels, but more rapid decline in serum levels following both the 1 st and 2 nd vaccine doses (<23% peak levels within 80 days of the initial shot). The data demonstrate COVID-19 mRNA vaccines effectively induce spike antigen specific IgG and IgA and highlight marked differences in their persistence in serum.",2021,,,,,,PPR303278,10.1101/2021.03.23.21254060,,#93089,Campillo-Luna 2021,"",""

The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can provide crucial epidemiological information about the extent of infections independent of virologically detected case numbers. There is no large population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey from Norway; thus we estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Norway before the introduction of vaccines and described its distribution across demographic groups. In November-December 2020, a total of 110,000 people aged 16 years or older were randomly selected from the National Population Register and invited to complete a questionnaire and provide a dried blood spot (DBS) sample. The response rate was 30%; compliance rate for return of DBS samples was 88%. The national weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 0.9% (confidence interval 0.7-1.0). Seroprevalence was highest among those aged 16-19 years (1.9%, 0.9-2.9), those born outside the Nordic countries 1.4% (1.0-1.9), and in the counties of Oslo 1.7 % (1.2-2.2) and Vestland 1.4% (0.9-1.8).

CCP with OVSARS2IgG ratios equivalent to a therapeutically beneficial group had neutralizing titers of >=1:640 (PRNT50) and/or >=1:80 (PRNT90). Specificity and positive predictive value of the OVSARS2IgG for qualifying highly neutralizing CCP was optimal using ratios significantly greater than the FDA cutoff. CONCLUSION(S): This information provides a basis for refining the recommended properties of CCP used to treat COVID-19.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

"Ivermectin also inhibits the replication of bovine respiratory viruses (BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV) in vitro",Yesilbag K.; Toker E.B.; Ates O. ,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex is an important viral infection that causes huge economic losses in cattle herds worldwide. However, there is no directly effective antiviral drug application against respiratory viral pathogens; generally, the metaphylactic antibacterial drug applications are used for BRD. Ivermectin (IVM) is currently used as a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent both for veterinary and human medicine on some occasions. Moreover, since it is identified as an inhibitor for importin alpha/beta-mediated nuclear localization signal (NLS), IVM is also reported to have antiviral potential against several RNA and DNA viruses. Since therapeutic use of IVM in COVID-19 cases has recently been postulated, the potential antiviral activity of IVM against bovine respiratory viruses including BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV are evaluated in this study. For these purposes, virus titration assay was used to evaluate titers in viral harvest from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic IVM concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 muM) and compared to titers from non-treated infected cells. This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV, BPIV-3 and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses. Finally, this study shows for the first time that IVM can inhibit infection of BRD-related viral agents namely BCoV, BPIV-3, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 at the concentrations of 2.5 and 5 muM. Consequently, IVM, which is licensed for antiparasitic indications, also deserves to be evaluated as a broad-spectrum antiviral in BRD cases caused by viral pathogens.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,/,Virus Research,297,"(Yesilbag, Toker, Ates) Department of Virology, Bursa Uludag University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bursa 16059, Turkey",198384,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198384,2011440539,#92668,Yesilbag 2021,"",""

Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64-327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5-9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100-379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Result(s): Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing's disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 degreeC) and chest pain. Oxygen therapy, antibiotics and symptomatic treatments lead to full recovery 24 days later. A 66-year-old woman with a 4-year medical history of mild CD (late-night serum cortisol 603.4 nmol/L, LNSC 10.03 nmol/L) tested positive for COVID-19 in routine screening and remained asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with CS depends on the severity of hypercortisolism. Thus, severe hypercortisolism is a warning sign that CS affected by COVID-19 could require emergency care despite a lack of clinical presentations and low inflammation biomarkers.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,/,Endocrine,,"(Belaya, Melnichenko, Tarbaeva, Gorokhov, Kalashnikov, Dzeranova, Volchkov, Dedov) The National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Moscow, Russian Federation(Golounina, Fadeev) I.M.

A pilot study of burnout and long covid in senior specialist doctors,Doherty A.M.; Colleran G.C.; Durcan L.; Irvine A.D.; Barrett E. ,"Background: Covid-19 has placed unprecedented demand on healthcare systems and on healthcare professionals. There have been concerns about the risk of distress, moral injury and burnout among healthcare professionals, especially doctors. Aim(s): To assess the effect of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic on Irish doctors by investigating the incidence of burnout and long covid among senior medical staff in Ireland. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional pilot study of the prevalence of burnout and long covid among senior physicians. A survey was sent by email to members of the Irish Hospital Consultant's Association. The survey included measures of mental and physical health and the 2-item Maslach Burnout Scale (MBS-2). The study explored the experience of delivering health care in the context of a pandemic and experience of the long covid syndrome. Result(s): A total of 114 responses were received. Three-quarters 77% (N = 88) screened positive for burnout on the MBS, with mean score of 5.6 (SD3.3), nearly double the cut-off for burnout. Nearly two-thirds (64%, n = 72) reported that Covid-19 has had an adverse effect on their mental health. One-quarter reported that they or colleagues had experience of 'long-covid' secondary to the virus. Conclusion(s): More comprehensive evaluation of the effect of the pandemic on front-line staff is needed to identify the extent of the problem and the factors which contribute to it.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Induced Immune Activation and Death of Monocyte-Derived Human Macrophages and Dendritic Cells,Zheng J.; Wang Y.; Li K.; Meyerholz D.K.; Allamargot C.; Perlman S. ,"Studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients and experimentally infected animals indicate a critical role for augmented expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines in severe disease. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells was abortive, but induced the production of multiple antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines (interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins 1beta, 6, and 10) and a chemokine (CXCL10). Despite the lack of efficient replication in MDMs, SARS-CoV-2 induced profound interferon-mediated cell death of host cells. Macrophage activation and death were not enhanced by exposure to low levels of convalescent plasma, suggesting that antibody-dependent enhancement of infection does not contribute to cell death. Together, these results indicate that infection of macrophages and dendritic cells potentially plays a major role in coronavirus disease 2019 pathogenesis, even in the absence of productive infection.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Viral Infectivity in Patients Undergoing Tracheotomy With COVID-19: A Preliminary Study.,"George, Manish M; McIntyre, Charlotte J; Zhou, Jie; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Amos, Dora C; Dillon, Ivan J; Barclay, Wendy S; Tolley, Neil S","OBJECTIVE: To establish the presence of live virus and its association with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and antibody status in patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheotomy., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study., SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic., METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays., RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80., CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded.

The Impact of Old and Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors.,"Podesta, Manuel Alfredo; Valli, Federica; Galassi, Andrea; Cassia, Matthias A; Ciceri, Paola; Barbieri, Lucia; Carugo, Stefano; Cozzolino, Mario","Cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication and the most common cause of death in patients with CKD. Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.

Circulating Calprotectin as a Biomarker of COVID-19 Severity.,"Mahler, Michael; Meroni, Pier-Luigi; Infantino, Maria; Buhler, Katherine A; Fritzler, Marvin J","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although demographic and clinical parameters such as sex, age, comorbidities, genetic background and various biomarkers have been identified as risk factors, there is an unmet need to predict the risk and onset of severe inflammatory disease leading to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease., AREAS COVERED: Pubmed was searched using the following keywords: Calprotectin + COVID19, S100A8/A9 + COVID19, S100A8 + COVID-19, S100A9 + COVID-19, MRP8/14 + COVID19; L1 + COVID-19 between May 2020 and March 8th 2021.

Finding the real COVID-19 case-fatality rates for SAARC countries.,"Shah, Md Rafil Tazir; Ahammed, Tanvir; Anjum, Aniqua; Chowdhury, Anisa Ahmed; Suchana, Afroza Jannat","The crude case fatality rate (CFR), because of the calculation method, is the most accurate when the pandemic is over since there is a possibility of the delay between disease onset and outcome. Adjusted crude CFR measures can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated the COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the SAARC countries. This study estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for these countries. Moreover, we assessed the crude CFR between genders and across age groups and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to October 9, we implemented a statistical method to remove the delay between disease onset and outcome bias, and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias in crude CFR. We found that Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.708% to 0.290%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.767% to 0.296% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.096% to 0.083%. Furthermore, the crude CFRs for men were significantly higher than that of women in Afghanistan (4.034% vs. 2.992%) and Bangladesh (1.739% vs. 1.337%) whereas the opposite was observed in Maldives (0.284% vs. 0.390%), Nepal (0.006% vs. 0.007%), and Pakistan (2.057% vs. 2.080%). Besides, older age groups had higher risks of death. Moreover, crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR. Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association Publishing House. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020., METHODS: Participants (n=7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in person method. IgG to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay., RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR positive test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3-4 months., CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicate more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentration produced from these asymptomatic exposures is similar to IgG levels occurring after documented non-hospitalized COVID-19, which is considerably lower than that produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases.

A Comprehensive Analysis of Maternal and Newborn Disease and Related Control for COVID-19.,"Cimolai, Nevio","The maternal-fetal/newborn unit is established at risk for COVID-19 infection. This narrative review summarizes the contemporary and cumulative publications which detail maternal infection, antenatal and newborn infections, and maternal/fetal/newborn management and prevention. There is a wide spectrum of maternal disease, but the potential for severe disease albeit in a minority is confirmed. COVID-19 carries risk for preterm delivery. Pregnant females can suffer multisystem disease, and co-morbidities play a significant role in risk. Congenital infection has been supported by several anecdotal reports, but strong confirmatory data are few. No typical congenital dysmorphisms are evident. Nevertheless, placental vascular compromise must be considered a risk for the fetus during advanced maternal infections. Clinical manifestations of newborn infection have been mild to moderate and relatively uncommon. Proven antiviral therapy is of yet lacking. The mode of delivery is a medical decision that must include patient risk assessment and patient directives. Both presymptomatic and asymptomatic mothers and offspring can complicate infection control management with the potential for spread to others in several regards.

After adjusting for confounding factors, the hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.30) and 1.21 (95% CI 1.06-1.38) for elderly men and women. The hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.07 (95% CI 1.01-1.13) for elderly men and 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.25) for elderly women.

Implications of pre-existing asthma on COVID-19 pathogenesis.,"Ramakrishnan, Rakhee K; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamid, Qutayba","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spreading at an alarming rate has taken a heavy toll on the public healthcare systems and economies worldwide. An abnormal and overactivated inflammatory response is occasionally elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this hyperinflammation is associated with worse prognosis of COVID-19. Theoretically, one would expect asthma patients to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their increased susceptibility to common respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. Surprisingly, current data do not consistently suggest an increased prevalence of asthma among COVID-19 patients. Considering the high global prevalence of asthma, the characteristics of the disease and/or their conventional therapy might play a role in their potential defense against COVID-19. This may be attributed to the T helper type 2 immune response predominantly seen in asthmatics. Likewise, asthma therapeutics, including corticosteroids and biologics, may in fact benefit the asthmatics by alleviating the development of hyperinflammation. On the other hand, elevated IL-17 levels are characteristically seen in a subset of asthma patients with severe disease as well as in COVID-19 patients. Targeting the IL-17 pathway as a treatment strategy could plausibly alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients with asthma demonstrating a predominant T helper type 17 response. A clinical trial including a drug targeting this pathway may thus, constitute a logical addition to the global pursuit for effective therapeutics against COVID-19. The complex interplay between the asthma endotypes and COVID-19 is not very well understood and will be discussed in this mini-review.",2021,/,American journal of physiology.

There remains a need to improve wastewater RNA extraction methods' sensitivity, speed, and reduce reliance on often expensive commercial reagents to make wastewater-based epidemiology more accessible. We present a kit-free wastewater RNA extraction method, titled ""Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2"" (4S), that employs the abundant and affordable reagents sodium chloride (NaCl), ethanol, and silica RNA capture matrices to recover sixfold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater than an existing ultrafiltration-based method. The 4S method concurrently recovered pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human 18S ribosomal subunit rRNA, which have been proposed as fecal concentration controls. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in three sewersheds corresponded to the relative prevalence of COVID-19 infection determined via clinical testing. Lastly, controlled experiments indicate that the 4S method prevented RNA degradation during storage of wastewater samples, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and in our experience, 20 samples can be processed by one lab technician in approximately 2 h.

Monoclonal antibodies capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding motif specifically prevent GM-CSF induction.,"Qiang, Xiaoling; Zhu, Shu; Li, Jianhua; Chen, Weiqiang; Yang, Huan; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J; Wang, Haichao","A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected approximately 94 million and killed more than 2,000,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibodies that can inhibit virus-ACE2 interaction to prevent viral entry. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm,"" and revealed a potentially anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND CEREBROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS WITH COVID-19.,"Greenberg, Arielle; Pemmasani, Gayatri; Yandrapalli, Srikanth; Frishman, William H","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted the health of people across the globe. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a significant relationship with COVID-19, both as a risk factor and prognostic indicator, and as a complication of the disease itself. In addition to predisposing to CVD complications, the ongoing pandemic has severely affected the delivery of timely and appropriate care for cardiovascular conditions resulting in increased mortality. The etiology behind the cardiac injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 is likely varied, including coronary artery disease, microvascular thrombosis, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy. Further large-scale investigations are needed to better determine the underlying mechanism of myocardial infarction and other cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients, and to determine the incidence of each type of cardiac injury in this patient population. Telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies can play an important role in optimizing outcomes in patients with established CVD. In this article, we summarize the various impacts that COVID-19 has on the cardiovascular system, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, thrombosis and stroke.

This study, prepared by a large international panel of stroke experts, assesses the rapidly growing research and personal experience with COVID-19 stroke and offers recommendations for stroke management in this challenging new setting: modifications needed for prehospital emergency rescue and hyperacute care; inpatient intensive or stroke units; posthospitalization rehabilitation; follow-up including at-risk family and community; and multispecialty departmental developments in the allied professions., SUMMARY: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses spike proteins binding to tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, most often through the respiratory system by virus inhalation and thence to other susceptible organ systems, leading to COVID-19. Clinicians facing the many etiologies for stroke have been sobered by the unusual incidence of combined etiologies and presentations, prominent among them are vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction. International standards of acute stroke management remain in force, but COVID-19 adds the burdens of personal protections for the patient, rescue, and hospital staff and for some even into the postdischarge phase. For pending COVID-19 determination and also for those shown to be COVID-19 affected, strict infection control is needed at all times to reduce spread of infection and to protect healthcare staff, using the wealth of well-described methods. For COVID-19 patients with stroke, thrombolysis and thrombectomy should be continued, and the usual early management of hypertension applies, save that recent work suggests continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Prothrombotic states, some acute and severe, encourage prophylactic LMWH unless bleeding risk is high. COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy adds risk of cardioembolic stroke, where heparin or warfarin may be preferable, with experience accumulating with DOACs. As ever, arteritis can prove a difficult diagnosis, especially if not obvious on the acute angiogram done for clot extraction. This field is under rapid development and may generate management recommendations which are as yet unsettled, even undiscovered. Beyond the acute management phase, COVID-19-related stroke also forces rehabilitation services to use protective precautions. As with all stroke patients, health workers should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress developing in their patients and caregivers. Postdischarge outpatient care currently includes continued secondary prevention measures. Although hoping a COVID-19 stroke patient can be considered cured of the virus, those concerned for contact safety can take comfort in the increasing use of telemedicine, which is itself a growing source of patient-physician contacts. Many online resources are available to patients and physicians. Like prior challenges, stroke care teams will also overcome this one. Key Messages: Evidence-based stroke management should continue to be provided throughout the patient care journey, while strict infection control measures are enforced. Copyright © 2021 S.

We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England., METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers were recruited across three English regions and tested monthly from March to November 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies using five different immunoassays. In positive individuals, antibody responses and long-term trends were modelled using mixed effects regression., FINDINGS: In total, 2246 individuals attended 12,247 visits and 264 were seropositive in >=2 assays. Most seroconversions occurred between March and April 2020. The assays showed >85% agreement for ever-positivity, although this changed markedly over time. Antibodies were detected earlier with Abbott (N) but declined rapidly thereafter. With the EuroImmun (S) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) assays, responses increased for 4 weeks then fell until week 12-16 before stabilising. For Roche (N), responses increased until 8 weeks, stabilised, then declined, but most remained above the positive threshold. For Roche (S), responses continued to climb over the full 24 weeks, with no sero-reversions. Predicted proportions sero-reverting after 52 weeks were 100% for Abbott, 59% (95% credible interval 50-68%) Euroimmun, 41% (30-52%) RBD, 10% (8-14%) Roche (N) <2% Roche (S)., INTERPRETATION: Trends in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection are highly dependent on the assay used.

We compiled available evidence on tape contamination as a cause for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)., MAIN FINDINGS: Forty-two publications reported relevant microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and/or nosocomial outbreaks. Results demonstrated that tape rolls handled with questionable practices can harbor pathogens. Some studies showed the association between contaminated tape and HAIs, which in some cases even led to death., CONCLUSIONS: The time has come to establish national guidelines to help reduce the risk of cross-contamination from medical tapes.

The aim of this survey was to study changes in lifestyle habits, treatment adherence, and mental health status in patients with cardiometabolic disease, but no clinical evidence of COVID-19. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms. Result(s): A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3 +/- 15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018). No physical activity was reported by 38% of patients. Only 15% of patients met minimum recommendations of physical activity (more than 150 minutes/week) and vegetable and fruit intake. Low/very low income (45.5%) was associated with a lower level of physical activity (p < 0.0001), less fruit and vegetables intake (p < 0.0001), more tobacco use (p < 0.001) and perception of depression (p < 0.001). Low educational level was also associated with the perception of depression (OR 1.46, CI 1.26-1.70; p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Patients with cardiometabolic disease but without clinical evidence of COVID-19 showed significant medication non-adherence, especially in secondary prevention patients. Deterioration in lifestyle habits and appearance of depressive symptoms during the pandemic were frequent and related to socioeconomic status.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The patient's data concerning medical history, clinical manifestation, arterial blood gas analysis, mode of oxygenation, radiological imaging, and outcome were extracted from their medical records and compared pre- and post-TCZ infusion. Result(s): All patients of the study group had symptomatic presentations with a mean PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio of 205.41 before TCZ infusion. All patients had a raised IL-6 level (mean value 206.56 pg/mL) that was extremely elevated in 90% of patients. Infusion of TCZ dramatically reduced mean body temperature (100.78-99.32degreeF) and the requirement for supplemental oxygen (68-48%) and improved mean SpO2 (86-89%) and mean PF ratio (208-240) within 24 hours. Three patients on noninvasive ventilation were weaned off after TCZ infusion. Serum levels of IL-6 were raised initially but declined within 3 to 5 days of post-TCZ infusion. Conclusion(s): TCZ appears to be an effective therapeutic option in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients with raised IL-6 levels. TCZ immediately improves the clinical status of patients by a probable mechanism of inhibition of cytokine storm and reduces COVID-19-related mortalities.Copyright © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers.",2021,/,Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,25,3,260-266,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23747,634531049,#91689,Bhandari 2021,"",""
Highlights in covid-19 from the 62nd american society of hematology annual meeting,Kessler C.M. ,"The high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and its consequent morbidity and mortality-along with an elevated risk for arterial thrombotic disease-was recognized early on by providers caring for individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many hypotheses have been presented to explain the pathologic hypercoagulability seen in these patients. It has been difficult to determine how each potential risk factor contributes to the development of thrombotic complications, however. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have underlying medical conditions, and the illness affects multiple organs. The use of various therapeutic modalities to mitigate the systemic effects of the illness can further obscure the direct effects of COVID-19. At this time, physicians are searching for ways to predict which patients with COVID-19 are most likely to be affected by thrombosis. Identifying them is important because aggressive VTE prophylaxis may increase the rates of major bleeding complications and mortality, even as it reduces thrombogenesis. The concept of individualizing the dosing of low-molecular-weight heparin according to the severity of each patient's COVID-19 clinical status is emerging, and adaptive therapeutic trials are in progress. Until results are available, however, it is important to recognize potential risk factors for thrombosis. The following observational studies from the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting provide some insights on how to accomplish this.Copyright © 2021, Millennium Medical Publishing, Inc..

A cluster analysis of epidemiological and clinical factors associated with the accumulation process of the burden of covid-19 in european countries,Shojaee S.; Eslami P.; Moghadam A.D.; Pourhoseingholi M.A.; Ashtari S.; Vahedian-Azimi A.; Zali M.R. ,"Background and aim of the work: European COVID-19 statistics showed differentiation between mortality and new cases. Some studies suggested several factors including migration, cancer incidence, life expectancy and health system capacity maybe associated with differentiations. Up to now, impact of those factors in different European societies is not discussed and compared. Aim of the present study was to perform the cluster analysis in European countries in attention to clinical and epidemiological factors due to covid-19. Method(s): We collected some appropriate extreme data of COVID-19 to access the situations by ANOVA post-hoc test in 3 scenarios, as well as to estimate regression coefficients in simple linear regression, and a cluster analysis using average linkage. The present study was designed to assess the situation in the European region in the face of COVID-19 from the beginning of the conflict to April 24, 2020. Result(s): Among 39 European countries, several countries reported highest rate of confirmed cases included of Italy (current stat-ues=2270.52) and Spain (current status=2616.24). The highest rate of mortality was seen in France (current status=242.16), Italy (current status=305.52). Life expectancy (female) (P=0.01, 95%Cl=1521.27,15264.58), migration (P<0.001, 95%Cl=41.42,96.72) had significant association with confirmed cases and death. Overall cancer death (P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.36,0.68; P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.01,0.07) and lung cancer death (P<0.001, 95%Cl=1.97,3.56; P<0.001, 95%Cl=0.09,0.37) associated with confirmed cases and mortality, too. We were also determined 5 clusters which more than 30 countries were categorized in the first cluster. Conclusion(s): Demographic factors, including population, life expectancy and migration, underlying disorders, such as several types of cancers, especially lung cancers lead to various distribution of COVID-19 in terms of prevalence and mortality, across European counties.

"COVID-19 pandemic effect on early pregnancy: are miscarriage rates altered, in asymptomatic women?",Rotshenker-Olshinka K.; Volodarsky-Perel A.; Steiner N.; Rubenfeld E.; Dahan M.H. ,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic state on early, first-trimester pregnancies. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study conducted at a university-affiliated fertility center in Montreal, Quebec, since the COVID-19 shut down, March 13 until May 6, 2020. Included: all women who came for a first-trimester viability scan during the study period (Study group) and between March 1, 2019 and May 17, 2019, approximately one year prior (Control). The study population denied symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed all first trimester scans. Early first-trimester pregnancy outcomes (Viable pregnancy, arrested pregnancy including biochemical pregnancy loss and miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy) were measured as total number and percentage. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for other potentially significant variables, as was a power analysis supporting sample size. Result(s): 113 women came for a first-trimester viability scan in the study period, and 172 in the control period (5-11 weeks gestational age), mean maternal age 36.5 +/- 4.5 and 37.2 +/- 5.4 years (p = 0.28). Viable clinical pregnancy rate was not different between the two groups (76.1 vs. 80.2% in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups p = 0.41). No significant difference was seen in the total number of arrested pregnancies (defined as the sum of biochemical, 1st trimester miscarriages, and blighted ova) (22.1 vs. 16.9% p = 0.32), or in each type of miscarriage.

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hepatitis B virus infection - a retrospective study,Liu R.; Zhao L.; Cheng X.; Han H.; Li C.; Li D.; Liu A.; Gao G.; Zhou F.; Liu F.; Jiang Y.; Zhu C.; Xia Y. ,"Background & Aims: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic. Although COVID-19 is caused by infection in the respiratory tract, extrapulmonary manifestations including dysregulation of the immune system and hepatic injury have been observed. Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, we sought to study the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HBV coinfection in patients. Method(s): Blood samples of 50 SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients, 56 SARS-CoV-2 mono-infected patients, 57 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patient controls and 57 healthy controls admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected in this study. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry panels including markers indicative of liver functions were performed. Cytokines including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection did not significantly affect the outcome of the COVID-19. However, at the onset of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients showed more severe monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as more disturbed hepatic function in albumin production and lipid metabolism. Most of the disarrangement could be reversed after recovery from COVID-19. Conclusion(s): While chronic HBV infection did not predispose COVID-19 patients to more severe outcomes, our data suggest SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection poses a higher extent of dysregulation of host functions at the onset of COVID-19. Thus, caution needs to be taken with the management of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The reliability and success of peritoneal dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic,Yeter H.H.; Gok Oguz E.; Akcay O.F.; Karaer R.; Yasar E.; Duranay M.; Ayli M.D.; Guz G. ,"We evaluated the symptoms, changes in laboratory findings during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and the effect of depression in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). This is an observational and cross-sectional study. All patients were asked to fill the clinical assessment form and Beck depression and anxiety inventory. Also, the last two laboratory evaluations during this period were examined. A total of 123 patients performing PD were included. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the total study population, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum albumin, phosphorus and ferritin levels significantly elevated at the end of 97 +/- 31 days. PTH and phosphorus levels remained stable in remote monitoring automated PD (RM-APD) group (p = 0.4 and p = 0.5), they tended to increase in continuous ambulatory PD group and significantly increased in automated PD group (p = 0.09 and p = 0.01 for PTH and p = 0.06 and p = 0.001 for phosphorus, respectively). Moderate to severe depression was associated with dyspnoea, weight gain more than 5 kg, fatigue, palpitation and increased anxiety. PD is a reliable and successful form of dialysis and can be safely administered even if hospital access is restricted. Also, RM-APD may be a better choice because of providing more stable bone-mineral metabolism.

Adaptation to online technology for learning during covid-19 pandemic: An observational study of effectiveness and student's perception in various universities,Kumar S.; Sharma A.; Sharma S.; Pal S.; Singh A.K. ,"Introduction: COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious disease caused by a virus named 'coronavirus'. To control the rapid spread of the virus, Indian government announced lockdown in whole country. The lockdown has largely affected the lives of students because education was shifted from traditional classroom learning to online learning. After COVID 19 pandemic the online teaching-learning has become more prevalent in India, it becomes particularly important to know its effectiveness and to know whether it's actually helping the students to achieve what they expect. Aim(s): The present study was designed to understand the effectiveness, student's perspective, attitudes and readiness about online classes being conducted at the University level. Material(s) and Method(s): An observational, descriptive study was conducted with a total sample size of 400. Students studying in four different universities were included in the study. The data was collected using a Questionnaire. A semi structured, self-administered questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms with open and close ended questionnaire and was circulated among university going students via WhatsApp and e-mail. The data was tabulated by Google spreadsheet. SPSS version 20 was used for data analysis. Result(s): Out of 400 students, who participated in the study, 55.25% students liked and 44.75% disliked online teaching during the lockdown period. However, 90.5% said that classroom was an effective platform for learning in comparison to online learning. Total of 6.5% subjects were completely satisfied, 24.5% somewhat satisfied and 8.25% were completely unsatisfied with online learning experience. A 44.75% student also felt difficult to spend several hours on mobile or computer. Conclusion(s): After analysing the results, it was concluded that the students liked the online classes but are not interested in continuing the same way after the lockdown. They felt that classroom teaching was more effective than online learning due to issues related to topic understanding, net connectivity, and lack of practical and/or demonstrations. Hence, certain improvements must be made to increase its acceptability amongst students.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

In that way the first 11 lines of section 7 of the paper should read: As previously reported by Pal and Banerjee (65) few data on possible effects of coronaviruses on the thyroid are available. Thyroid hormones were reported to be decreased in patients affected by SARS during acute infection and recovery suggesting an euthyroid sick syndrome. However, damaged but not reduced in size thyroid cells were found at an autoptic study on five SARS patients [71,72]. Functional and pathological thyroid data in COVID-19 are in the process to be collected [65]. Regarding Graves' disease, COVID-19 can be a precipitating factor for initiation or relapse of the disease (M. Marazuela, personal experience). Several medical societies have recommended to take special care to patients with hyperthyroidism receiving antithyroid drugs, because symptoms of the rare side effect of agranulocytosis can overlap with COVID-19. In this scenario, if symptoms of COVID-19, agranulocytosis should be ruled out immediately with a full blood count. ORIGINAL TEXT Data on thyroid involvement by coronavirus are most scarce. A study conducted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 had reported that serum Triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were lower in patients with SARS as compared to controls, both during the acute and convalescent phases. This could simply imply an underlying euthyroid sick syndrome. However, a study of the autopsy in five patients with SARS has shown marked destruction of the follicularand parafollicular thyroid cells [71] and not a reduction in thyroid follicular size associated with euthyroid sick syndrome [72]. Destruction of follicular cells may also be identified as a low triiodothyronine and thyroxine profile. Data on thyroid function or thyroid pathology are yet not available in COVID-19 [65]. Regarding Graves' disease, COVID-19 can be a precipitating factor for initiation or relapse of the disease (M. Marazuela, personal experience).

It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio- and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high-risk patients with COVID-19. Material(s) and Method(s): DARE-19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator-initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have >=1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all-cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID-19 will be assessed. Conclusion(s): DARE-19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID-19-related complications and all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population.

Long covid syndrome following infection with sars-cov-2- a devastating influence on health status in some affected individuals,Soni S.N.; Nimbalkar S.M. ,"Almost a year since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began causing COVID-19, our knowledge about its manifestations continues to expand. As more people become fatally ill with COVID-19, it is now clear that many patients who developed a mild illness, recovered from a serious illness, or had an asymptomatic infection are also beginning to suffer from a newly described entity called Long COVID. Studies show that show COVID-19 influences the cardiovascular framework, yet the general effects stay obscured. Impaired diffusion capacity, lower respiratory muscle strength, and lung imaging abnormalities are seen in COVID-19 patients in the early recovery stage. As compared to non-severe cases, severe patients had a higher incidence of Diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) impairment and are more prone to total lung capacity decrease and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) decline.

Role of hrct chest and artificial intelligence in evaluation of covid-19 patients: An observational study,Panda S.; Sen K.K.; Kanyari S.S.; Mohanty S.S.; Kumar G.M.; Kuniyil J.; Goyal M.; Aavula A. ,"Introduction: An early diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is of utmost importance, so that patients can be isolated and treated in time, eventually preventing spread of the disease, improving the prognosis and reducing the mortality. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) chest imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven analysis of HRCT chest images can play a vital role in management of COVID-19 patients. Aim(s): To explore the various HRCT chest findings in different phases of COVID-19 pneumonia and to assess the potential role of AI in quantitative assessment of lung parenchymal involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia. Material(s) and Method(s): The present retrospective observational study which was conducted between 1st May 2020 to 13th August 2020. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive 2169 COVID-19 patients who underwent HRCT chest were included in the study. Presence and distribution of lesions like: Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), consolidation and any specific patterns like septal thickening, reverse halo, sign, etc., were noted in the HRCT images. HRCT chest findings in different phases of disease (Early: <5 days, Intermediate: 6-10 days and Late phase: >10 days) were assessed. CT Severity Score (CTSS) was calculated based on the extent of lung involvement on HRCT, which was then correlated with the clinical severity of the disease. Artificial Intelligence powered ""CT Pneumonia analysis"" algorithm was used to quantify the extent of involvement of lungs by calculating Percentage of Opacity (PO) and Percentage of High Opacity (PHO) in lungs. Tests of statistical significance, like Chi-square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Post-hoc tests were applied depending on the type of variables, wherever applicable. Result(s): Radiological findings were seen in HRCT chest of 1438 patients. Typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia, i.e., bilateral, peripherally located GGO with or without consolidation was seen in 846 patients. About 294 asymptomatic patients were found to be radiologically positive. HRCT chest in the early phase of disease mostly showed GGO. Features like increased reticulation, predominance of consolidation, presence of fibrous stripes indicated late phase. About 91.3% of cases having CTSS <=7 were asymptomatic or clinically mild whereas, 81.2% cases having score >=15 were clinically severe. The mean PO and PHO (30.1+/-28.0 and 8.4+/-10.4, respectively) were remarkably higher in clinically severe category. Conclusion(s): Progression of COVID-19 pneumonia is rapid, so radiologists and clinicians need to get familiarised with the typical CT chest findings, hence patients can be treated on time, eventually improving the prognosis and reducing the mortality. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to be a valuable tool in management of COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Immune Response in Exogenously Immunosuppressed Patients,Zilla M.L.; Keetch C.; Mitchell G.; McBreen J.; Shurin M.R.; Wheeler S.E. ,"BACKGROUND: While it is presumed that immunosuppressed patients, such as solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppression, are at greater risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population, the antibody response to infection in this patient population has not been studied. METHOD(S): In this report, we follow the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in patients with COVID-19 who are undergoing exogenous immunosuppression. Specifically, we studied the antibody response of 3 solid organ transplant recipient patients, 3 patients who take daily inhaled fluticasone, and a patient on etanercept and daily inhaled fluticasone, and compared them to 5 patients not on exogenous immunosuppression. RESULT(S): We found that the solid organ transplant patients on full immunosuppression are at risk of having a delayed antibody response and poor outcome. We did not find evidence that inhaled steroids or etanercept predispose patients to delayed immune response to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION(S): The data presented here suggest that solid organ transplant recipients may be good candidates for early targeted intervention against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

A Bayesian framework for estimating the risk ratio of hospitalization for people with comorbidity infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus,Gao X.; Dong Q. ,"OBJECTIVE: Estimating the hospitalization risk for people with comorbidities infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important for developing public health policies and guidance. Traditional biostatistical methods for risk estimations require: (i) the number of infected people who were not hospitalized, which may be severely undercounted since many infected people were not tested; (ii) comorbidity information for people not hospitalized, which may not always be readily available. We aim to overcome these limitations by developing a Bayesian approach to estimate the risk ratio of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We derived a Bayesian approach to estimate the posterior distribution of the risk ratio using the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. We applied our approach to 2 large-scale datasets in the United States: 2491 patients in the COVID-NET, and 5700 patients in New York hospitals. RESULT(S): Our results consistently indicated that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our approach only needs (i) the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their comorbidity information, which can be reliably obtained using hospital records, and (ii) the prevalence of the comorbidity of interest in the general population, which is regularly documented by public health agencies for common medical conditions. CONCLUSION(S): We developed a novel Bayesian approach to estimate the hospitalization risk for people with comorbidities infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies to an Automated Chemiluminescent Serological Immunoassay,Grenache D.G.; Ye C.; Bradfute S.B. ,"INTRODUCTION: Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are capable of binding to a virus to render it incapable of infection. The ability of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests to detect NAbs has not been widely reported. We sought to correlate the antibodies detected by an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay with NAbs. METHOD(S): Residual serum samples from 35 patients that had a positive antibody test using the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay and 2 antibody-negative control sera were tested for NAbs using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULT(S): NAbs were detected in 66% (23/35) of the antibody-positive samples. The immunoassay signal value ranged from 21.7 to 131.3AU/mL (median, 90.5) with significant correlation between it and the PRNT (r=0.61, P=0.002). In the samples without NAbs, the immunoassay signal ranged from 16.3 to 66.2AU/mL (median, 27.2). An immunoassay signal cutoff of >41AU/mL was 91% sensitive and 92% specific for the detection of NAbs. DISCUSSION: It is important that correlates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 be identified and NAbs are considered to be central indicators of such. PRNT is the gold-standard test for identifying NAbs but it cannot be used for large-scale testing of populations. It is necessary to establish relationships between it and widely used commercial serological assays for SARS-CoV-2.Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020. All rights reserved.

Comparison of Two Automated Immunoassays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Antibodies,Hubbard J.A.; Geno K.A.; Khan J.; Szczepiorkowski Z.M.; de Gijsel D.; Ovalle A.A.; AlSalman A.S.; Gallagher T.L.; Johnston A.A.; Tibbetts A.R.; Vital S.E.; Cervinski M.A.; Nerenz R.D. ,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel member of the coronavirus family that caused the global coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. METHOD(S): 407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. RESULT(S): Both assays exhibited 100% specificity (95% CI; 99.05-100.00), giving no positive results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215 specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differences between platforms were most notable in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Roche offered higher sensitivity in convalescent plasma donors at 95.7% (95% CI; 78.1-99.9) versus 91.3% (95% CI; 72.0-98.9) but Abbott detected antibodies in 2 immunocompromised patients whereas Roche did not. The Roche and Abbott platforms also exhibited different trends in antibody signal for a subset of patients. CONCLUSION(S): Both the Abbott and Roche platforms offer excellent specificity but different trends in antibody signal may reflect qualitative differences in the types of antibodies recognized by the 2 assays. Negative serologic results do not exclude previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright © American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020. All rights reserved.

"Association of ACEI/ARB, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19",Xiang D.; Ren X.; Chen Q.; Yu H.; Li X.; Liu D. ,"Background: Currently, SARS-CoV-2 liver invasion, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral drugs are widely thought to be associated with liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, previous studies indicated that ACEI/ARB drugs can increase the expression of hepatic ACE2, a cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to investigate whether ACEI/ARB aggravates liver injury and the association of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19. Method(s): This retrospective study included 127 hypertensive patients with long-term use or nonuse of ACEI/ARBs hospitalized for COVID-19 from January 30 to April 7, 2020, in Tongji hospital of Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected. Result(s): Of the 127 patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, 43 taking long-term of ACEI/ARBs and 84 without using ACEI/ARBs. Abnormal liver function was observed in part of ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB users but without significant differences between these two groups. Serum inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFalpha, as well as inflammation-related markers, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, were significantly elevated in patients with liver dysfunction. IL-6 level was positively correlated with liver function tests on admission and highly consistent with the changes of abnormal ALT, AST, and GGT during hospitalization, but the correlations of other inflammatory cytokines were low. There was no significant association between the use of antiviral drugs and liver dysfunction in these patients. Conclusion(s): The elevation of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, but not ACEI/ARB and antiviral drugs, is closely associated with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",2021,/,Clinical and Experimental Hypertension,43,4,305-310,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2020.1867160,2007701127,#91523,Xiang 2021,"",""
A retrospective study assessing the characteristics of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and donations,Del Fante C.; Franchini M.; Baldanti F.; Percivalle E.; Glingani C.; Marano G.; Mengoli C.; Mortellaro C.; Viarengo G.; Perotti C.; Liumbruno G.M. ,"Background: Although many trials are currently investigating the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) in critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is a paucity of ongoing and published studies evaluating the CP donors' side. This retrospective study reports the first Italian experience on CP donors' selection and donations. Method(s): Patients aged 18-68 years who had recovered from COVID-19 at least 2 weeks previously were recruited between March 18 and June 30, 2020 in a study protocol at the Italian hospitals of Pavia and Mantova. Result(s): During the study period, 494 of 512 donors recruited were judged eligible and underwent 504 plasmapheresis procedures. Eighty-five percent (437/512) of the CP donors were males. The average time between symptom recovery and CP donation was 36.6 (+/-20.0) days. Four hundred and eighty-eight plasmapheresis procedures (96.8%) were concluded and each unit was divided into two subunits (total 976) with an average volume of 316.2 (+/-22.7) mL. Ninety-three percent (460/494) of CP donors at the time of plasma donation had a neutralizing IgG titer >=1:80. Plasmapheresis-related adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% (13/504) of cases; all the reactions were mild and none required therapeutic intervention. Donors' age and COVID-19 severity were positively associated with greater antibody responses. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a pilot CP program conducted in Italy. The identification of factors (ie, age and severity of COVID-19) positively associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers at the time of donation may help to optimize the selection of CP donors.Copyright © 2020 AABB",2021,/,Transfusion,61,3,830-838,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/trf.16208,2007592985,#91522,DelFante 2021,"",""
Immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: A rapid review,O Murchu E.; Byrne P.; Walsh K.A.; Carty P.G.; Connolly M.; De Gascun C.; Jordan K.; Keoghan M.; O'Brien K.K.; O'Neill M.; Smith S.M.; Teljeur C.; Ryan M.; Harrington P. ,"In this review, we systematically searched and summarized the evidence on the immune response and reinfection rate following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also retrieved studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to assess the long-term duration of antibody responses. A protocol based on Cochrane rapid review methodology was adhered to and databases were searched from 1/1/2000 until 26/5/2020. Of 4744 citations retrieved, 102 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventy-four studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV-2. While the rate and timing of IgM and IgG seroconversion were inconsistent across studies, most seroconverted for IgG within 2 weeks and 100% (N = 62) within 4 weeks. IgG was still detected at the end of follow-up (49-65 days) in all patients (N = 24). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 92%-100% of patients (up to 53 days). It is not clear if reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is possible, with studies more suggestive of intermittent detection of residual RNA. Twenty-five studies were retrieved on SARS-CoV. In general, SARS-CoV-specific IgG was maintained for 1-2 years post-infection and declined thereafter, although one study detected IgG up to 12 years post-infection. Neutralizing antibodies were detected up to 17 years in another study. Three studies on MERS-CoV reported that IgG may be detected up to 2 years. In conclusion, limited early data suggest that most patients seroconvert for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG within 2 weeks. While the long-term duration of antibody responses is unknown, evidence from SARS-CoV studies suggest SARS-CoV-specific IgG is sustained for 1-2 years and declines thereafter.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,/,Reviews in Medical Virology,31,2,e2162,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2162,2006759173,#91520,OMurchu 2021,"",""

In particular, this pandemic has further exacerbated the burden in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where dengue fever, caused by dengue virus (DENV), is already endemic to the population. The similar clinical manifestations shared by Covid-19 and dengue fever have raised concerns, especially in dengue-endemic countries with limited resources, leading to diagnostic challenges. In addition, cross-reactivity of the immune responses in these infections is an emerging concern, as pre-existing DENV-antibodies might potentially affect Covid-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement. In this review article, we aimed to raise the issue of Covid-19 and dengue fever misdiagnosis, not only in a clinical setting but also with regards to cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and DENV antibodies.

"Investigation of immune cells on elimination of pulmonary-Infected COVID-19 and important role of innate immunity, phagocytes",Farshi E.; Kasmapur B.; Arad A. ,"We identified types of immune cells that contribute to clearing COVID-19 during the acute phase of the infection in mouse model and human. Our results suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for controlling COVID-19 infection. Mild infection report of children by COVID-19 comparing adults' infection causes conclusion of higher resistance of immune system of children comparing adults. Our results show innate immune system including phagocytes contribute severely to the elimination of COVID-19 in both mouse model and human. Our results also show the elimination of COVID-19 required the activation of B cells by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells play an important role in elimination of COVID-19 in primary effection. We measured IgM and IgG in all patients including adults and kids (human) and found IgM and IgG in kids patients are much higher than other adults patients. It causes production of much more natural antibodies in kids' bodies to protect them against COVID-19 that shows reason of mild effection of kids comparing adults. Our observations have important ramifications for the development of novel vaccination and medicine strategies to alleviate COVID-19.

This study aimed to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of tocilizumab and its role in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, mortality rate for these cases. Method(s): The study included 25 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 infection. Treatment of all patients followed Egyptian Ministry of Health COVID-19 protocol in addition to tocilizumab IV (400-800 mg) as a single dose and then the dose was repeated after at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours from the previous dose. All laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before and within 24 hours after tocilizumab administration. Result(s): After receiving TCZ, all patients showed significantly lower median IL 6, LDH, CRP, ferritin, TLC at P <.001, and D-Dimer at P =.223 than their baseline levels. Also, the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation decreased from 11 to 8. Only five patients died after TCZ treatment. A moderate correlation was found between therapeutic failure and death outcomes and mechanical ventilation need at baseline. The median days of hospitalisation (IQR) were 10 (6-16). Conclusion(s): Tocilizumab treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 is safe and has significant therapeutic effects and a significant role in the improvement of all laboratory parameters. Also TCZ plays a significant role in the reduction of the length of stay in hospital and ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate.What's known IL-6 plays the main role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID-19 infection.

2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.,Anonymous,"This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.

However, its characterization and determinants of poorer outcomes among the at-risk Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) patient population has not been thoroughly investigated. Cytokine-producing T-cell responses such as IFN-gamma, IL-2, IFN-gamma/IL-2, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-5 against main immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 antigens and IgM/IgG serological immunity were tracked in SOT (n=28) during acute infection and at 2 consecutive time-points over the following 40 days of convalescence and were compared to matched IC (n=16) patients admitted with similar moderate/severe COVID-19. We describe the development of a robust serological and functional T-cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 among SOT patients, similarly to IC patients during early convalescence. However, at the infection onset, SOT displayed lower IgG seroconversion rates (77% vs 100%; p=0.044), despite no differences on IgG titters, and a trend towards decreased SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell frequencies, especially against the membrane protein (7[0-34] vs 113[15-45] p=0.011, 2[0-9] vs 45[5-74], p=0.009 and 0[0-2] vs 13[1-24], p=0.020, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IFN-gamma/IL-2 spots, respectively).

We evaluated crude rates and multivariable incident rate ratios(IRR) of COVID-19 mortality. There were 131,659 candidates during the study period with 3,534 all-cause deaths and 384 denoted a COVID-19 cause (5.00/1000 person years). Factors associated with increased COVID-19 mortality included increased age, males, higher body mass index and diabetes. In addition, Blacks (IRR=1.96,95%C.I.1.43-2.69) and Hispanics(IRR=3.38,95%C.I.2.46-4.66) had higher COVID-19 mortality relative to Whites. Patients with lower educational attainment, high school or less (IRR=1.93,95%C.I.1.19-3.12,relative to post-graduate), Medicaid insurance (IRR=1.73,95%C.I.1.26-2.39,relative to private), residence in most distressed neighborhoods (5th quintile IRR=1.93,95%C.I.1.28-2.90,relative to 1st quintile) and most urban and most rural had higher adjusted rates of COVID-19 mortality. Among kidney transplant candidates in the US, social determinants of health in addition to demographic and clinical factors are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality.

Coronavirus Occurrence in the HIVE Cohort of Michigan Households: Reinfection frequency and serologic responses to seasonal and SARS coronaviruses.,"Petrie, Joshua G; Bazzi, Latifa A; McDermott, Adrian B; Follmann, Dean; Esposito, Dominic; Hatcher, Christian; Mateja, Allyson; Narpala, Sandeep R; O'Connell, Sarah E; Martin, Emily T; Monto, Arnold S","BACKGROUND: We investigated frequency of reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and serum antibody response following infection over 8 years in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation cohort., METHODS: Households were followed annually for identification of acute respiratory illness with RT-PCR confirmed HCoV infection. Serum collected before and at two time points post infection were tested using a multiplex binding assay to quantify antibody to seasonal, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SARS-CoV-2 spike sub-domains and N protein., RESULTS: Of 3418 participants, 40% were followed for >=3years. A total of 1004 HCoV infections were documented; 303 (30%) were reinfections of any HCoV type. The number of HCoV infections ranged from 1 to 13 per individual. The mean time to reinfection with the same type was estimated at 983 days for 229E, 578 days for HKU1, 615 days for OC43, and 711 days for NL63. Binding antibody levels to seasonal HCoVs were high, with little increase post-infection, and were maintained over time. Homologous, pre-infection antibody levels did not significantly correlate with odds of infection, and there was little cross response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins., CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection with seasonal HCoVs is frequent. Binding anti-spike protein antibodies do not correlate with protection from seasonal HCoV infection. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Surveillance-based informative testing for detection and containment of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on a public university campus: an observational and modelling study.,"Rennert, Lior; McMahan, Christopher; Kalbaugh, Corey A; Yang, Yuan; Lumsden, Brandon; Dean, Delphine; Pekarek, Lesslie; Colenda, Christopher C","BACKGROUND: Despite severe outbreaks of COVID-19 among colleges and universities across the USA during the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of institutions did not routinely test students. While high-frequency repeated testing is considered the most effective strategy for disease mitigation, most institutions do not have the necessary infrastructure or funding for implementation. Therefore, alternative strategies for testing the student population are needed. Our study detailed the implementation and results of testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread on a university campus, and we aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of the different testing strategies., METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we included 6273 on-campus students arriving to a large public university in the rural USA (Clemson, SC, USA) for in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 semester (Sept 21 to Nov 25). Individuals arriving after Sept 23, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before Aug 19, and student athletes and band members were not included in this study. We implemented two testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread during this period: a novel surveillance-based informative testing (SBIT) strategy, consisting of random surveillance testing to identify outbreaks in residence hall buildings or floors and target them for follow-up testing (Sept 23 to Oct 5); followed by a repeated weekly surveillance testing (Oct 6 to Nov 22). Relative changes in estimated weekly prevalence were examined. We developed SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to compare the relative effectiveness of weekly testing (900 daily surveillance tests), SBIT (450 daily surveillance tests), random surveillance testing (450 daily surveillance tests), and voluntary testing (0 daily surveillance tests) on disease mitigation. Model parameters were based on our empirical surveillance data in conjunction with published sources., FINDINGS: SBIT was implemented from Sept 23 to Oct 5, and identified outbreaks in eight residence hall buildings and 45 residence hall floors. Targeted testing of residence halls was 2.03 times more likely to detect a positive case than random testing (95% CI 1.67-2.46). Weekly prevalence was reduced from a peak of 8.7% to 5.6% during this 2-week period, a relative reduction of 36% (95% CI 27-44). Prevalence continued to decrease after implementation of weekly testing, reaching 0.8% at the end of in-person instruction (week 9). SARS-CoV-2 transmission models concluded that, in the absence of SBIT (ie, voluntary testing only), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have increased by 154% throughout the semester. Compared with SBIT, random surveillance testing alone would have resulted in a 24% increase in COVID-19 cases. Implementation of weekly testing at the start of the semester would have resulted in 36% fewer COVID-19 cases throughout the semester compared with SBIT, but it would require twice the number of daily tests., INTERPRETATION: It is imperative that institutions rigorously test students during the 2021 academic year. When high-frequency testing (eg, weekly) is not possible, SBIT is an effective strategy to mitigate disease spread among the student population that can be feasibly implemented across colleges and universities., FUNDING: Clemson University, USA.

We evaluated risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized older adults with and without COVID-19., METHODS: Observational study of patients admitted to two geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 1st to June 15th, 2020. The difference in incidence, risk factors and adverse outcomes for AKI between patients with or without COVID-19 were examined. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of AKI and in-hospital death were obtained from logistic regression., RESULTS: Three hundred-sixteen older patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 876 patients for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. AKI occurred in 92 (29%) patients with COVID-19 vs. 159 (18%) without COVID-19. The odds for developing AKI were higher in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.76), low baseline kidney function as depicted by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [4.19 (2.48-7.05), for eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min, and 20.3 (9.95-41.3) for eGFR < 30 mL/min], and higher C reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.81 (1.11-2.95) in patients with initial CRP > 10 mg/L).

Favipiravir, indicated for the treatment of new and re-emerging influenza infections, has been suggested to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, although this has not yet been fully validated. We administered favipiravir to a 64-year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. Decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with resolution of the fever. The present case suggests that drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of relapsing fever episodes in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir. Copyright © 2021.

A possible role for ST2 as prognostic biomarker for COVID-19.,"Ragusa, Rosetta; Basta, Giuseppina; Del Turco, Serena; Caselli, Chiara","COVID-19 is a pandemic illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). It has been estimated that 80% of subject infected are asymptomatic or have mild to moderate symptoms. Differently, in severe cases of COVID-19 cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe systemic inflammatory response and cardiovascular diseases were observed Even if all molecular mechanisms leading to cardiovascular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients remain to be clarified, the evaluation of biomarkers of cardiac injury, stress and inflammation proved to be an excellent tool to identify the COVID-19 patients with worse outcome. However, the number of biomarkers used to manage COVID-19 patients is expected to increase with increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease. It is our view that soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) can be used as biomarker in COVID-19. sST2 is routinely used as prognostic biomarker in patients with HF. Moreover, high circulating levels of sST2 have also been found in subjects with ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis. Keeping in mind these considerations, in this review the possible mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV2 infection could damage the cardiovascular system were summarized and the possible role of sST2 in COVID-19 patients with CVD was discussed.

Increased antimicrobial resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, Shey-Ying; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren","In addition to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection itself, an increase in the incidence of antimicrobial resistance poses collateral damage to the current status of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There has been a rapid increase in multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs), including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, pan-echinocandin-resistant Candida glabrata, and multi-triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The cause is multifactorial and particularly related to high rates of antimicrobial agent utilization in COVID-19 patients with a relatively low rate of co- or secondary infection. Appropriate prescription and optimized use of antimicrobials according to the principles of antimicrobial stewardship program, quality diagnosis, and aggressive infection control measures may help prevent the occurrence of MDROs during this pandemic.

Usefulness of a multiplex immunodot in case of discordant results between automated COVID-19 serological assays.,"Reza, Soleimani; Mehdi, Khourssaji; Antoine, Aupaix; Hector, Rodriguez-Villalobos; Anais, Scohy; Benoit, Kabamba-Mukadi","BACKGROUND: At present, the only reliable test for COVID-19 diagnosis is RT-qPCR. Serological assays have been widely used to increase the detection sensitivity of infected population. Hereby, we report the performance of a new pan-IgG multiplex Enzyme Immunoassay (immunodot) method for exploration of discrepant SARS-COV-2 serological results., METHODS: A retrospective study on 38 residual serum samples from recovered COVID-19 subjects with discordant serological results on Roche and Snibe platforms, were reanalyzed on a new semi-automated pan-IgG immunodot Enzyme Immunoassay, namely COVIDOT-TEST, in order to find the source of discrepancies and to evaluate the latter method. All samples were analyzed on the BlueDiver R Instrument and all strips were read by the BlueScan R Scanner using Dr DOT R Software., RESULTS: Based on our data, subject samples showed specific IgG reactions on >= 2 different antigens on immunodot strips. Of these 38 samples, 97.4% of samples showed specific IgG reaction against S1 + S2 antigens, 89.5% showed against RBD antigen, 86.8% against S2 antigen reaction on the COVIDOT-TEST kit. Specific IgG-S1 antigen and IgG-N antigen reactions were detected in 73.7% and 65.8% of the samples, respectively., CONCLUSION: The new semi-automated pan-IgG immunodot Enzyme Immunoassay method appeared to be a reliable assay to confirm suspicious COVID-19 serological screening results.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results., METHODS: Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification., RESULTS: Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence., CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 inhibition is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19. Long-term benefits of IL-6 inhibition, its effectiveness across healthcare systems, and implications for differing standards of care are currently unknown. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The effectivity of vitamin D as a therapeutic intervention in critical illness remains less defined. The current study analyzed clinical and immunologic effects of vitamin D levels in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)., METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D3 via enteral feeding., RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters did not differ between patients with sufficient or deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only circulating plasmablasts were higher in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels >=30 ng/ml (p = 0.029). Patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 pg/ml required longer mechanical ventilation (p = 0.045) and had a worse acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0.048)., CONCLUSION: The vast majority of COVID-19 ARDS patients had vitamin D deficiency. 25-hydroxyvitamin D status was not related to changes in clinical course, whereas low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and a worse APACHE II score.

Status of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and complement system in COVID-19 patients and therapeutic applications of antiviral plant MBLs.,"Gupta, Anita; Gupta, G S","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a virus called ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). "" In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.",2021,/,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,,"ngu, 0364456",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-021-04107-3,33745077,#91237,Gupta 2021,"",""
Effects of COVID-19 on the admissions of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the West Greece experience.,"Theofanopoulos, Andreas; Fermeli, Dionysia; Boulieris, Spyros; Kalantzis, George; Kefalopoulou, Zinovia; Panagiotopoulos, Vasilios; Papadakos, Dimitrios; Constantoyannis, Constantine","BACKGROUND: Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a devastating vascular disease accounting for 5% of strokes. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics., METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period., RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1-2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients' length of stay (p = 0.193)., CONCLUSIONS: The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown.

Urban environments and COVID-19 in three Eastern states of the United States.,"Lee, Whanhee; Kim, Honghyok; Choi, Hayon Michelle; Heo, Seulkee; Fong, Kelvin C; Yang, Jooyeon; Park, Chaerin; Kim, Ho; Bell, Michelle L","The United States has the highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed. Copyright © 2021.

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape.

Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended., CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered.

Pre-vaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was due to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization.

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing antibodies are especially sought. Here we report a novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent human subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2, sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the 43 human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50s) of 6.7 x10-12 M to 6.7x10-15 M for spike pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized with IC50<6.7 x10-12 M viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. The results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain-specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses SARS-CoV-2 could take.",2021,/,JCI insight,,101676073,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.147386,33769311,#91426,GarciadeMattosBarbosa 2021,"",""

Most cases (72%) had lower exposure to low-risk occupations of infectious disease as per the classification of the department of health while high exposure risk occupations, which included healthcare worker accounts only for 3%. While 43% of cases were asymptomatic, 57% displayed symptoms, which were mostly mild. Only 12% of patients had comorbidities, which were significantly higher in men (9%) than women (3%). Among those who have comorbid conditions; hypertension (27%) and diabetes (21%) were the most common comorbidities. Viral pneumonia (11%) was the most common sequela documented in records. Only 51 patients (4%) required admission to the intensive care units, and 4 patients died (0.1%). The significant number of asymptomatic patients was identified by active case finding and contact tracing from the early period of the epidemic. A small percentage of severe, critical cases, and death reported in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi which may have been due to public health measures implemented for early detection, contact tracing, and treatment.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in COVID-19: Case reports of a stepwise approach.,"Schnaubelt, Sebastian; Tihanyi, Daniel; Strassl, Robert; Schmidt, Ralf; Anders, Sonja; Laggner, Anton N; Agis, Hermine; Domanovits, Hans","RATIONALE: The immunologic syndrome induced by severe acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is yet not fully understood. Typical patterns of clinical and laboratory features match secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). However, the optimal approach to COVID-19 patients testing positive for sHLH is still unclear., PATIENT CONCERNS: Three patients with COVID-19 are reviewed. All showed hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, necessitating intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation., DIAGNOSIS: Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to severe COVID-19; diagnosed via HScore., INTERVENTIONS: A treatment regimen of methylprednisolone, pentaglobin, and anakinra was developed and administered., OUTCOMES: One patient survived the ICU stay. Two other patients, in whom sHLH was diagnosed too late, deceased., LESSONS: A routine screening of COVID-19 patients for secondary HLH by using the HScore is feasible; especially those patients deteriorating clinically with no sufficient response to shock management might be at particular high risk. A stepwise therapeutic approach comprising corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anakinra, accompanied by immunoadsorption, may dampen cytokine storm effects, and potentially reduce mortality.

Development and Evaluation of a new Swiss Made SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid test,"P.J, Ducrest","There is an urgent need in rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect antigen of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) detecting nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV-2 in 10 minutes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and analytical sensitivity of this RDT. RT-PCR positive nasopharyngeal swab samples (n=20) for SARS-CoV-2 and 40 negative control samples were studied. Analytical sensitivity was assessed using Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and the limit of detection (LOD) was determined at 1.4 × 10 2 TCID 50 /ml. Overall, RDT diagnostic sensitivity was 90% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 67-98%) and specificity 98% (95% CI: 85-100%). The sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 75-100%) when using only samples with a RT-PCR Cycle threshold lower than 30. This antigen RDT displays a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in high COVID-19 prevalence settings.

Detecting the Coronavirus (COVID-19),"Pokhrel, Pravin; Hu, Changpeng; Mao, Hanbin","The COVID-19 pandemic has created huge damage to society and brought panics around the world. Such panics can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of the COVID-19: compared to other deadly viral outspreads, it has medium transmission and mortality rates. As a result, the severity of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was deeply underestimated by the society at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, in this review, we define the viruses with features similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 as the Panic Zone viruses. To contain those viruses, accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts. This is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease, which is the case for current COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2021, more than two hundred kits for the COVID-19 diagnosis on the market are surveyed in this review, while emerging sensing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed. It is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for the efficient management and control of the Panic Zone viruses. Therefore, we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the Panic Zone viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in particular. While it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid-based detection kits with low false negativity (high sensitivity) at the early stage of an outbreak, the low false positivity (high specificity) gains its importance at later stages of the outbreak. When a society is set to reopen from the lock-down stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critical to have antibody based immunoassay kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to the society after their recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Given that the emergence of mutant viruses at the beginning of 2021 has complicated current battle against the COVID-19, we also discussed approaches and guidelines to detect viral mutants in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic that started at the end of 2020. Finally, since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society, we urge both government and private sectors to research and develop more affordable and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) kits, which can be used massively by the general public (and therefore called as massive POCT) to contain Panic Zone viruses in future.",2021,,,,,,PPR303530,10.20944/preprints202004.0201.v2,,#93107,Pokhrel 2021,"",""

At first, the patient presented with septic shock and multi-organ failure in the context of a suspected lymphoproliferative syndrome.

The first suspected diagnosis was a lymphoproliferative syndrome and bacterial infection. The second possibility was a hemophagocytic syndrome in a patient recovering from COVID-19. He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics because the differential diagnosis was difficult, and we removed them when the microbiological screening was negative. During the course of the disease he presented with severe biventricular dysfunction, probably due to the cytokine storm, so we used inotropic drugs (adrenaline, levosimendan).

Computational assessment of the spike protein antigenicity reveals diversity in B cell epitopes but stability in T cell epitopes across SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Ge, Anni; Rioux, Melissa; Kelvin, Alyson","Since its emergence into the human population at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to develop a protective vaccine against COVID-19 have yielded several vaccine platforms currently in distribution targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence from the first cases of infection. In recent months, variants of SARS-CoV-2 have raised concerns that viral mutation may undermine vaccination efforts through viral escape of host immune memory acquired from infection or vaccination. We therefore used a computational approach to predict changes in spike protein antigenicity with respect to host B cell and CD8+ T cell immunity across six SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and mink-related). Our epitope analysis using DiscoTope suggests possible changes in B cell epitopes in the S1 region of the spike protein across variants, in particular the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages, which may influence immunodominance. Additionally, we show that high-affinity MHC-I-binding peptides and glycosylation sites on the spike protein appear consistent between variants with the exception of an extra glycosylation site in the P.1 variant. Together, these analyses suggests T cell vaccine strategies have the most longevity before reformulation.",2021,,,,,,PPR303423,10.1101/2021.03.25.437035,,#93104,Ge 2021,"",""

We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring, orally available, well-tolerated, nutritional supplement present in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables with limited side effects. SFN inhibited in vitro replication of four strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as that of the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further, SFN and remdesivir interacted synergistically to inhibit coronavirus infection in vitro. Prophylactic administration of SFN to K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased the viral load in the lungs and upper respiratory tract and reduced lung injury and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice.

We report 2,921 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the context of >12,000 publicly available genomes sampled globally over the first pandemic wave (up to June 1 st , 2020). By combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses with epidemiological data, we quantify the number of introduction events into Québec, identify their origins, and characterize the spatio-temporal spread of the virus. Conservatively, we estimated at least 500 independent introduction events, the majority of which happened from spring break until two weeks after the Canadian border closed for non-essential travel. Subsequent mass repatriations did not generate large transmission lineages (>50 cases), likely due to mandatory quarantine measures in place at the time. Consistent with common spring break and ‘snowbird’ destinations, most of the introductions were inferred to have originated from Europe via the Americas. Fewer than 100 viral introductions arrived during spring break, of which 5-10 led to the largest transmission lineages of the first wave (accounting for 36-58% of all sequenced infections). These successful viral transmission lineages dispersed widely across the province, consistent with founder effects and superspreading dynamics. Transmission lineage size was greatly reduced after March 11 th , when a quarantine order for returning travelers was enacted. While this suggests the effectiveness of early public health measures, the biggest transmission lineages had already been ignited prior to this order. Combined, our results reinforce how, in the absence of tight travel restrictions or quarantine measures, fewer than 100 viral introductions in a week can ensure the establishment of extended transmission chains.",2021,,,,,,PPR303339,10.1101/2021.03.20.21253835,,#93102,LíaMurall 2021,"",""

We demonstrate that immune escape can occur through two mechanisms, antibodies that fail to recognize mutations, along with antibodies that have reduced inhibitory capacity due to enhanced variant RBD-ACE2 affinity. A competitive approach where antibodies simultaneously compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD may therefore more accurately reflect the physiological dynamics of infection.

To assess the morbidity, clinical course, maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women in the Far Eastern and Siberian Federal Districts. Materials and methods. The latest information on COVID-19 in pregnant, parturient and puerperal women was analyzed. The data were presented by chief obstetricians-gynecologists of these Districts in the period from 11 March to 25 December 2020. Results. During the specified period, 8485 cases of COVID-19 were registered in pregnant, parturient and puerperal women. The rate of morbidity was 3 times higher among these women compared to the general population: 5933.2 versus 1960.8 per 100,000 people. In 27.4% of mothers, SARS-CoV-2 infection was asymptomatic; in 52.7% it was mild; in 16.6% - moderately severe, in 2.5% - severe and in 0.5% - very severe. Pregnant women were more often hospitalized and stayed in intensive care and anesthesiology units compared to patients in the general population (3.57% vs 2.24%, p<0.001), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was used less often (0.48% vs 1.05%, p<0.001). 27.97% (2373) of patients delivered their babies. Preterm delivery was in 18.3% of women, cesarean section - in 42.0%, operative vaginal delivery - in 0.2%. 12 mothers (0.14%) with COVID-19 died (mortality rate was 1.95% in the general population, p<0.001).

A study of correlation between asthma control test and lung function parameters,Adala R.Y.; Suriyan N.S.; Nagesh N.J.; Manimohan R. ,"Introduction: Asthma control is the extent of observed asthma symptoms in patients and reduction in symptoms after treatment. Simple screening tools are available to assess asthma control. Asthma control test is a simple numerical scoring system that can be easily used on a routine basis. Latest Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines stress that asthma control is the main objective of asthma treatment. In this COVID-19 pandemic situation, there is an hesitancy in performing and undergoing pulmonary function tests among physicians and the patients. Hence, in this study it was planned to correlate the asthma control test values with FEV1 and other parameters like Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC) and serum magnesium. Aim(s): To study the correlation between asthma control test and FEV1; to study the correlation between asthma control test and other parameters like PEFR, AEC and Serum magnesium. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a cross-sectional observational study done from February 2019 to January 2020 conducted at Department of Pulmonary Medicine. A total of 55 patients of Bronchial asthma in line with GINA Guidelines were included in the study. Asthma control test questionnaire was administered to all the patients. Routine blood investigations like Total Leucocyte Count (TLC), Differential Leucocyte Count (DLC), Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC), serum magnesium levels were done. Pulmonary function parameters like FEV1 and PEFR were measured. Result(s): Asthma control test had positive correlation with FEV1 with a spearman's correlation of 0.2758 and p-value of 0.0414 which was statistically significant. The spearman's correlation between asthma control test and AEC was -0.4583 with a p-value of <0.001, which was significant. The correlation of asthma control test with serum magnesium was 0.3414 with a p-value of 0.010. Conclusion(s): Asthma control test score had a significant positive correlation with FEV1 and serum magnesium levels. It also had significant negative correlation with AEC (inflammatory marker).

Result(s): Among 573 patients, 222 were in group A and 351 were in group B. Fever was the most common presenting feature (69.6%) followed by dry cough and shortness of breath. Other features were malaise/fatigability, diarrhoea and anosmia. Among the co-morbidities hypertension and diabetes were significantly different between the two groups. Among the biochemical parameters Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), C-Reactive Protein (CPR), D-dimer, Prothrombin time, Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) were significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion(s): In a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata, fever is the most common presentation followed by dry cough and fatigability in COVID patients. Diabetes and hypertension are the common co morbidities. CRP, NLR, D-dimer, prothrombin time, SGOT and SGPT should be monitored to differentiate between mild and severe cases.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Correlation of the ratio of IgM/IgG concentration to days after symptom onset (IgM/T or IgG/T) with disease severity and outcome in non-critical COVID-19 patients,Rong Y.; Wang F.; Li X.; Liang X.; Zhou Y.; Zhang D.; Liu J.; Zeng H.; Wang J.; Shi Y. ,"Background: Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies with COVID-19 development and outcome has not been fully studied. Due to the time dynamic of antibodies, the antibody concentration of the same patient varies greatly at different times during the course of the disease. Therefore, our study used IgM/T or IgG/T (the ratio of serum antibody concentration to days after symptom onset) to reflect the patient's humoral immune status, and analyzed their correlation with COVID-19 development and outcome. Method(s): Clinical data of 50 non-critical COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Time-resolved fluorescence immunochromatography was used to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Correlation analysis was performed. Result(s): IgM antibody was positive on day 5 of symptom onset, increased within 2 weeks, and then gradually decreased. However, IgG antibody was positive on week 2 of symptom onset and continued to increase since. Additionally, IgM/T, but not IgG/T of recovery period (Spearman rho=0.17; P=0.283), was negatively correlated with disease course in 2 weeks of symptom onset (Spearman rho=-0.860; P=0.000). IgG/T of recovery period was positively correlated with clinical classification (Spearman rho=0.432; P=0.004), number of involved lung lobes (Spearman rho=0.343; P=0.026), and lung lesions (Spearman rho=0.472; P=0.002). Conclusion(s): Within 2 weeks of symptom onset, higher IgM/T indicates faster recovery and shorter disease course. In recovery period, higher IgG/T suggests more serious disease. IgM/T or IgG/T may predict disease severity and outcome in non-critical COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2021 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the potential treatment of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,Wang S.; Ye J.; Kang Z.; Peng H.; Mackey V.; Sun L. ,"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and the seventh that can infect human beings and result in severe and acute respiratory syndrome and deaths. Currently, the world is undergoing a global health emergency due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As of May 18, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to over two hundred countries and infected more than 4.8 million people, resulting in over 300,000 deaths since the first case of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) patient was discovered in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019. Currently, there are no effective and/or approved targeting drugs for it though various supportive therapy drugs such as small molecule drugs, vaccines, antibodies and even Chinese herb medicines have been used in the treatment of the first-line patients. However, certain drugs such as remdesivir and S416 are under clinical investigation and may become therapeutic drugs.

Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among an online sample of sexual and gender minority men and transgender women,da Silva D.T.; Biello K.; Lin W.Y.; Valente P.K.; Mayer K.H.; Hightow-Weidman L.; Bauermeister J.A. ,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations are particularly vulnerable to poor COVID19 outcomes and are more likely to experience stigma and medical mistrust that may impact COVID19 vaccine acceptance. This study examined the prevalence of COVID testing and diagnosis and assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among a large sample of SGM. Participants were recruited as part of an online cross-sectional study focused on an HIV biomedical prevention technology willingness in the United States at increased risk for HIV sero-conversion. Multivariate linear analysis was conducted to examine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The study sample included 1350 predominately gay (61.6%), Black (57.9%), cis-gender (95.7%) males with a mean age of 32.9 years. Medical mistrust and social concern regarding COVID-19 vaccine stigma were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and altruism was significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Black participants were significantly less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and Asian participants were significantly more likely to accept a vaccine, compared to White peers. As the planning of COVID-19 vaccine rollout efforts is conceptualized and designed, these data may inform equitable implementation strategies and prevent worsening health inequities among SGM populations.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Sars-cov-2 infection is asymptomatic in nearly half of adults with robust anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain antibody response,Tsitsilonis O.E.; Paraskevis D.; Lianidou E.; Terpos E.; Akalestos A.; Pierros V.; Kostaki E.G.; Kastritis E.; Moutsatsou P.; Politou M.; Scorilas A.; Sphicopoulos T.; Thomaidis N.; Trougakos I.P.; Tsakris A.; Voulgaris N.; Daskalaki C.C.; Evangelakou Z.; Fouki C.; Gianniou D.D.; Gumeni S.; Kostopoulos I.V.; Manola M.S.; Orologas-Stavrou N.; Panteli C.; Papanagnou E.-D.; Rousakis P.; Sklirou A.D.; Smilkou S.; Stergiopoulou D.; Tsiodras S.; Dimopoulos M.-A.; Sfikakis P.P. ,"Between June and November 2020, we assessed plasma antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein in 4996 participants (aged 18-82 years, 34.5% men) from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The weighted overall prevalence was 1.6% and monthly prevalence correlated with viral RNA-confirmed SARSCoV-2 infections in Greece, in the same period. Notably, 49% of seropositive cases reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related clinical symptoms and 33% were unsuspected of their previous infection. Additionally, levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike-protein receptorbinding domain were similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, irrespective of age and gender. Using Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization-approved assays, these results support the need for such studies on pandemic evaluation and highlight the development of robust humoral immune responses even among asymptomatic individuals. The high percentage of unsuspected/asymptomatic active cases, which may contribute to community transmission for more days than that of cases who are aware and self-isolate, underscores the necessity of measures across the population for the efficient control of the pandemic.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Five types of vaccines are currently approved for emergency use in many countries (Inactivated, Sinopharm; Viral-vector, Astrazeneca, and Gamaleya Research Institute; mRNA, Moderna, and BioNTech/Pfizer). The main challenge in this pandemic was the availability to produce an effective vaccine to be distributed to the world's population in a short time. Herein, we developed a whole virus NRC-VACC-01 inactivated candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and tested its safety and immunogenicity in laboratory animals. In the preclinical studies, we used four experimental animals (mice, rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters). Antibodies were detected as of week three post vaccination and continued up to week ten in the four experimental models. Safety evaluation of NRC-VACC-01 inactivated candidate vaccine in rats revealed that the vaccine was highly tolerable. By studying the effect of booster dose in the immunological profile of vaccinated mice, we observed an increase in neutralizing antibody titers after the booster shot, thus a booster dose was highly recommended after week three or four.

"Allergic reactions to current available covid-19 vaccinations: Pathophysiology, causality, and therapeutic considerations",Kounis N.G.; Koniari I.; de Gregorio C.; Velissaris D.; Petalas K.; Brinia A.; Assimakopoulos S.F.; Gogos C.; Kouni S.N.; Kounis G.N.; Calogiuri G.; Hung M.-Y. ,"Vaccines constitute the most effective medications in public health as they control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce mortality. Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination.While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, ana-phylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactionsthat are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications.The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem fromactivation of mast cells via Fcepsilon receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include:The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal.Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy.Allergists' expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for thescreening of high-risk individuals.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Epidemiological differences in the impact of covid-19 vaccination in the united states and china,Makhoul M.; Chemaitelly H.; Ayoub H.H.; Seedat S.; Abu-Raddad L.J. ,"This study forecasts Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination impact in two countries at different epidemic phases, the United States (US) and China. We assessed the impact of both a vaccine that prevents infection (VES of 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEP of 95%) through mathematical modeling. For VES of 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32% and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEP of 95%, vaccination benefits were half those for VES of 95%. In both countries, impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US. COVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying ""epidemiologic inequity"" that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies: A network meta-analysis across vaccines,Rogliani P.; Chetta A.; Cazzola M.; Calzetta L. ,"Background: There are no studies providing head-to-head comparison across SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of candidate vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the peak levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies across candidate vaccines. Data were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) since the outcome was assessed via different metrics and methods across the studies. Result(s): Data obtained from 836 healthy adult vaccine recipients were extracted from 11 studies. BBIBP-CorV, AZD1222, BNT162b2, New Crown COVID-19, and Sputnik V induced a very large effect on the level of neutralizing antibodies (SMD > 1.3); CoVLP, Coro-naVac, NVX-CoV2373, and Ad5-nCoV induced a large effect (SMD > 0.8 to <=1.3); and Ad26.COV2.S induced a medium effect (SMD > 0.5 to <=0.8). BBIBP-CorV and AZD122 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5-nCoV, mRNA-1237, CoronaVac, NVX-CoV2373, CoVLP, and New Crown COVID-19; New Crown COVID-19 was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5-nCoV, and mRNA-1237; CoronaVac was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S and Ad5-nCoV; and Sputnik V and BNT162b2 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S.

Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19,Singh B.; Ryan H.; Kredo T.; Chaplin M.; Fletcher T. ,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial mortality. Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials. Objective(s): To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for. 1) treating people with COVID-19 on death and time to clearance of the virus;. 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure;. 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Search Method(s): We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), and the COVID-19-specific resources www.covid-nma.com and covid-19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. Selection Criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19, people at risk of COVID-19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID-19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT-interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate. Main Result(s): 1. Treatment of COVID-19 disease. We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co-interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention-to-treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three-fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT-interval on electrocardiogram (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ-and-azithromycin arm; this included QT-interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4%) developed confirmed COVID-19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (very low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low-certainty evidence). One cluster-randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID-19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 or production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the two study arms. Authors' conclusions: HCQ for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out. These results make it less likely that the drug is effective in protecting people from infection, although this is not excluded entirely. It is probably sensible to complete trials examining prevention of infection, and ensure these are carried out to a high standard to provide unambiguous results.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We collected 397 plasma donations from 278 convalescent donors. Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0.7-0.8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight. Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective; 77% were male, age 54 +/- 15.6 y/o (range 27-85), body mass index 29.7 +/- 4.4; hypertension 39% and diabetes 20.7%; 19.5% had an immunosuppressive condition, 23% were health workers. Plasma was administered to 55 (63%) on spontaneous breathing with oxygen supplementation (mainly oxygen mask with reservoir bag in 80%), and to 32 patients (37%) on mechanical ventilation. The 28-day survival rate was 80%; 91% in patients infused on spontaneous breathing and 63% in those on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0002). There was a significant improvement in the WHO pneumonia clinical scale at 7 and 14 days, and in PaO2 / FiO2, ferritin and LDH, in the week post-infusion. We observed an episode of circulatory volume overload and a febrile reaction, both mild. Convalescent plasma infusions are feasible, safe, and potentially effective, especially before requiring mechanical ventilation.

COVID 19 pandemic; a review on understanding the mode of transmission and application of strategies to delay/stop transmission with special reference to India,Singhal S.; Singhal P.; Mittal A.; Agarwal B.K.; Khatib M.; Gaidhane A. ,"Background: SARS CoV-2 has globally affected more than 31 hundred thousand population with more than 2 hundred thousand deaths till date, since its inception from Wuhan, China in December 2019. World is still clueless regarding definitive treatment for this highly contagious disease. Till then we have to rely on time tested methods to delay/stop transmission of this viral disease by observing social isolation, hand hygiene and wearing face mask. Objective(s): The main objective of this review paper is to focus on different modes of transmission of this virus, comparison of this virus with previous similar analogy viral diseases like SARS and MERS and different strategies that can be planned or are ongoing to reduce/delay transmission of this virus in community contacts, especially in context to India. Method(s): PUBMED, Google Scholar and BioRxiv search was performed with keywords; COVID-19, mode of transmission, infection, India, BCG. Around 538 eligible papers were evaluated from time period of January 1 to 29 April 2020 and results were summarized Results: On analysis of different papers on mode of transmission it was found that this virus is highly contagious and spreads through air droplet, close contact, through fomites and different metallic surfaces and through aerosol in surroundings with high aerosol generating procedures only. Also, it can spread both in asymptomatic and symptomatic phase equally so early testing is essential. Also, it is mutating in different host environments so it is imperative to include different strains in vaccine preparation. Conclusion(s): Results demonstrate the fact that early screening, social distancing, isolation of symptomatic patients, respiratory etiquette are the main armaments presently to deal with this virus till effective treatment or vaccine becomes available in the near future.

Physical sports activities and exercise addiction during lockdown in the Spanish population,Berengui R.; Lopez-Gullon J.M.; Angosto S. ,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the paralysis of the worldwide economy caused by the population's lockdown to stop the virus spreading, making it difficult to do exercise. The aim of this study is to analyse the commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to practising sport, sports habits and the profile of the Spanish population during lockdown according to the level of addiction to exercise. The sample consisted of 1019 subjects with a mean age of 35 years old. The variables analysed were exercise addiction, commitment to and feeling of insecurity related to sport, and sport habits. Three groups were identified according to their addiction level to exercise: asymptomatic (n = 202), symptomatic (n = 756), and at risk of addiction (n = 61). The main results indicated that a higher addiction level was associated with a higher number of days and time spent on exercise per week. Six percent of the subjects were at addiction risk, and they had a lower feeling of insecurity towards sport. These findings provide information to governments on the need to promote physical activity programmes at home to promote adequate fitness and mental wellbeing in the population.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Sars-cov-2 infection and inflammatory response in a twin pregnancy,Trombetta A.; Comar M.; Tommasini A.; Canton M.; Campisciano G.; Zanotta N.; Cason C.; Maso G.; Risso F.M. ,"There is growing literature about the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenetic effects exerted during pregnancy and whether vertical transmission or premature birth is possible. It is not well known whether changes in the immune system of pregnant women may lead to a marked susceptibility to infectious processes and the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal complications such as preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, transmission to the fetus or newborns, and fetal mortality are poorly understood. Along with this ongoing debate, it is not well defined whether, during pregnancy, the role of host susceptibility in producing a specific inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 may represent distinctive markers of risk of vertical transmission. Further-more, SARS-CoV-2 impact on the vaginal microbiome has not yet been described, despite mounting evidence on its possible effect on the gastrointestinal microbiome and its influence on infectious diseases and preterm labor. This report describes the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on a twin pregnancy diagnosed with infection at the third trimester of gestation including tissue infections, inflammatory response, antibody production, cytokine concentration, and vaginal microbiome composition. We identified a pattern of cytokines including IL1-Ra, IL-9 G-CSF, IL-12, and IL-8 differently expressed, already associated with previously infected patients. We detected a similar concentration of almost all the cytokines tested in both twins, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm is not substantially impaired during the placental passage. The analysis of the vaginal microbiome did not show relevant signs of dysbiosis, similar to other healthy pregnant women and twin healthy pregnancies. The aim of this report was to analyze the immunological response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus tissue tropism in a twin pregnancy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Hyperlipasemia in absence of acute pancreatitis is associated with elevated D-dimer and adverse outcomes in COVID 19 disease.,"Ahmed, Awais; Fisher, Jason C; Pochapin, Mark B; Freedman, Steven D; Kothari, Darshan J; Shah, Paresh C; Sheth, Sunil G","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organs. Studies have reported mild elevations of lipase levels of unclear significance. Our study aims to determine the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and hyperlipasemia, and whether correlation with D-dimer levels explains the effect on outcomes., METHODS: Case-control study from two large tertiary care health systems, of patients with COVID-19 disease admitted between March 1 and May 1, 2020 who had lipase levels recorded. Data analyzed to study primary outcomes of mortality, length of stay (LOS) and intensive care utilization in hyperlipasemia patients, and correlation with D-dimer and outcomes., RESULTS: 992 out of 5597 COVID-19 patients had lipase levels, of which 429 (43%) had hyperlipasemia. 152 (15%) patients had a lipase > 3x ULN, with clinical pancreatitis in 2 patients. Hyperlipasemia had a higher mortality than normal lipase patients (32% vs. 23%, OR = 1.6,95%CI = 1.2-2.1, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis, hyperlipasemia patients had significantly worse LOS (11vs.15 days, P = 0.01), ICU admission rates (44% vs. 66%,OR = 2.5,95%CI = 1.3-5.0,P = 0.008), ICU LOS (12vs.19 days,P = 0.01), mechanical ventilation rates (34% vs. 55%,OR = 2.4,95%CI = 1.3-4.8,P = 0.01), and durations of mechanical ventilation (14 vs. 21 days, P = 0.008). Hyperlipasemia patients were more likely to have a D-dimer value in the highest two quartiles, and had increased mortality (59% vs. 15%,OR = 7.2,95%CI = 4.5-11,P < 0.001) and LOS (10vs.7 days,P < 0.001) compared to those with normal lipase and lower D-dimer levels., CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of hyperlipasemia without clinical pancreatitis in COVID-19 disease.

We sought to calculate the prevalence of spitting on police officers in use of force incidents, as well as the demographic and situational factors associated with spitting., METHODS: Data on spitting were compiled from more than 10,000 use of force incidents occurring at 81 agencies in eight different states in the US., RESULTS: Spitting occurred in 3.6% of cases. Female and younger subjects and those using drugs and/or alcohol are more likely to spit on officers. Spitting is more likely to occur in incidents of longer duration, when officers use less force relative to subject resistance, when subjects are assaultive or engage in self-harm, and when subjects are hobbled., CONCLUSIONS: Spitting on officers is common and may now constitute a significant work hazard.

Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano., METHODS: Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC > 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 < VC < 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC < 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring., RESULTS: In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship (R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index (R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation (R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified (R = - 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down., HYPOTHESIS AND DISCUSSION: The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology.

The Case for S2: The Potential Benefits of the S2 Subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein as an Immunogen in Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Shah, Priyanka; Canziani, Gabriela A; Carter, Erik P; Chaiken, Irwin","As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, it is imperative to learn more about antibodies and T-cells produced against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, in order to guide the rapid development of therapies and vaccines. While much of the current antibody and vaccine research focuses on the receptor-binding domain of S1, a less-recognized opportunity is to harness the potential benefits of the more conserved S2 subunit. Similarities between the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 warrant exploring S2. Possible benefits of employing S2 in therapies and vaccines include the structural conservation of S2, extant cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in populations (due to prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses), the steric neutralization potential of antibodies against S2, and the stronger memory B-cell and T-cell responses. More research is necessary on the effect of glycans on the accessibility and stability of S2, SARS-CoV-2 mutants that may affect infectivity, the neutralization potential of antibodies produced by memory B-cells, cross-reactive T-cell responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and antigen competition. This perspective aims to highlight the evidence for the potential advantages of using S2 as a target of therapy or vaccine design.

Much remains unknown about detailed symptomatic features of COVID-19 onset and rehabilitation., METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe cases and 880 non-severe cases. The symptomatic features were analyzed and compared between the severe and non-severe groups. All patients were followed up 3 months after discharge., RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60%), cough (50.8%), and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms, followed by anorexia (21.8%) and dyspnea (19.2%). The median duration of fever was 7 days, which was characterized by persistent low fever. The median duration of cough was 17 days, characterized by dry cough without sputum. Most dyspnea occurred on the fourth day after illness onset, with a median duration of 16 days. The incidences of taste loss and olfactory disturbance were only 6.2% and 3.1%, respectively.

Black patients were more likely to be younger, have diabetes and obesity. The incidence of cardiac complications was 20%, with 9% of patients having new-onset arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes between Black and White patients. A multivariate analysis determined age>=60 years to be a predictor of new-onset arrhythmia (OR = 7.36, 95% CI [1.95;27.76], p = 0.003). D-dimer levels positively correlated with cardiac and new-onset arrhythmic event. New onset atrial arrhythmias predicted in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.99 95% CI [1.35;6.63], p = 0.007), a longer intensive care unit length of stay (mean of 6.14 days, 95% CI [2.51;9.77], p = 0.001) and mechanical ventilation duration(mean of 9.08 days, 95% CI [3.75;14.40], p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that new onset atrial arrhythmias are commonly encountered in COVID-19 patients and can predict in-hospital mortality. Early elevation in D-dimer in COVID-19 patients is a significant predictor of new onset arrhythmias. Our finding suggest continuous rhythm monitoring should be adopted in this patient population during hospitalization to better risk stratify hospitalized patients and prompt earlier intervention.

The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds., FINDINGS: During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 4.1 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 0.1-21.8) per 100 000 students and 12.5 (two of 16 038; 1.5-45.0) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (11.2%; 95% CI 7.9-15.1) of 816 students and 209 (15.1%; 11.9-18.9) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=0.13 for students and p=0.20 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=0.37). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (73.9%) of 816 students and 1015 (73.5%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted. By December, 2020, 55 (5.1%; 95% CI 3.8-6.5) of 1085 participants who were seronegative at recruitment (in June, 2020) had seroconverted, including 19 (5.6%; 3.4-8.6) of 340 students and 36 (4.8%; 3.4-6.6) of 745 staff members (p=0.60)., INTERPRETATION: In England, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low in primary schools following their partial and full reopening in June and September, 2020., FUNDING: UK Department of Health and Social Care.

Effect of Protein Corona on Nanoparticle-Lipid Membrane Binding: The Binding Strength and Dynamics.,"Lee, Hwankyu","All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 10 nm-sized anionic polystyrene (PS) particle complexed with plasma proteins (human serum albumin, immunoglobulin gamma-1 chain-C, and apolipoprotein A-I) adsorbed onto lipid bilayers [asymmetrically composed of extracellular (zwitterionic) and cytosolic (anionic) leaflets] are performed. Free energies calculated from umbrella sampling simulations show that proteins on the particle more weakly bind to the zwitterionic leaflet than do bare particles, in agreement with experiments showing the suppression of the particle-bilayer binding by protein corona. Proteins on the particle interact more strongly with the anionic leaflet than with the zwitterionic leaflet because of charge interactions between cationic protein residues and anionic lipid headgroups, to an extent dependent on various plasma proteins. In particular, hydrogen bonds between proteins and zwitterionic leaflets restrict the motion of lipids and thus reduce the lateral dynamics of bilayers, while the tight binding between proteins and anionic leaflets disrupts the helical structure of proteins and disorders lipids, leading to an increase in the lateral dynamics of bilayers. These findings help explain the experimental observation regarding the fact that the bilayer dynamics decreases when interacting with protein corona and suggest that the effect of protein corona on the binding strength and bilayer dynamics depends on protein types and bilayer charges.",2021,/,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,,9882736,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00249,33739835,#91081,Lee 2021,"",""

Human mobility and poverty as key drivers of COVID-19 transmission and control.,"Yechezkel, Matan; Weiss, Amit; Rejwan, Idan; Shahmoon, Edan; Ben-Gal, Shachaf; Yamin, Dan","BACKGROUND: Applying heavy nationwide restrictions is a powerful method to curtail COVID-19 transmission but poses a significant humanitarian and economic crisis. Thus, it is essential to improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission, and develop more focused and effective strategies. As human mobility drives transmission, data from cellphone devices can be utilized to achieve these goals., METHODS: We analyzed aggregated and anonymized mobility data from the cell phone devices of> 3 million users between February 1, 2020, to May 16, 2020 - in which several movement restrictions were applied and lifted in Israel. We integrated these mobility patterns into age-, risk- and region-structured transmission model. Calibrated to coronavirus incidence in 250 regions covering Israel, we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness in decreasing morbidity and mortality of applying localized and temporal lockdowns (stay-at-home order)., RESULTS: Poorer regions exhibited lower and slower compliance with the restrictions. Our transmission model further indicated that individuals from impoverished areas were associated with high transmission rates. Considering a horizon of 1-3 years, we found that to reduce COVID-19 mortality, school closure has an adverse effect, while interventions focusing on the elderly are the most efficient. We also found that applying localized and temporal lockdowns during regional outbreaks reduces the overall mortality and morbidity compared to nationwide lockdowns. These trends were consistent across vast ranges of epidemiological parameters, and potential seasonal forcing., CONCLUSIONS: More resources should be devoted to helping impoverished regions.

A physicochemical model for rationalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage.

A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV254/DOC) over the dissolved oxygen (DO) as the parameter with the highest correlation with viral copies. This implies a strong effect on viral inaccessibility in sewage caused (i) by the presence of humic-like substances and (ii) by virus decay due to oxidation and metabolic activity of bacteria. The present results suggest days where many fold corrections in the measurement of viral copies should be applied. As a result, although the detected RNA load in June 2020 is similar to that in April 2020, virus shedding in the city is about 5 times lower in June than in April, in line with the very low SARS-CoV-2 incidence and hospital admissions for COVID-19 in Thessaloniki in June.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2021,/,Science of the Total Environment,755,"(Petala, Sakaveli) Laboratory of Environmental Engineering & Planning, Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki 54 124, Greece(Dafou, Chatziefstathiou, Arsenakis) Department of Genetics, Development and Molecular",142855,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142855,2008378266,#92518,Petala 2021,"",""
TMPRSS2 variation and genomic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,Wang S.; Shovlin C.L. ,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which exhibits only rare coding variants.1 Viral entry is facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which has multiple roles including cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to allow the virus to fuse with the host cell membrane, and antibody neutralisation. We hypothesised that common variability in the TMPRSS2 gene may contribute to differing susceptibility to COVID-19 in different populations. Method(s): Functional domain profiles and primary sequence were established for the TMPRSS2 protein isoforms using UniProt. The coding sequence and population prevalences of genomic variants in the TMPRSS2 gene mapped to the GRCh38/hg38 reference sequence were identified in 71,702 unrelated individuals in Genome Aggregation Consortium (gnomAD) database v3. Variants were catagorised by molecular subtype and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Using R (v3.6.1), hierarchical clustering dendrogram methods were evaluated, allele frequencies visualised using mosaic plots, and population associations tested by Chisquared analysis. Result(s): Two TMPRSS2 protein isoforms are encoded by 14 exons of TMPRSS2 gene and have identical extracellular domains including the protease domain (peptidase S1 domain) which activates through autocleavage. Overall, 859 variants were identified in TMPRSS2 including 372 exonic (coding-region) of which 261 were non-synonymous, and 130 had a scaled CADD score exceeding 20 (i.e. in top 1% of deleterious variants). Hierarchical clustering trees separated into two main clusters, with the Euclidean distance smallest between African and European (non Finnish) populations and a larger distance to Latino, South Asian, East Asian and other populations. Variants in exons 1 and 2 encoding the cytoplasmic domain did not differ between population, but by Chi-squared, 34 TMPRSS2 variants with scaled CADD scores >20 differed in allele frequency between the populations. These included rare molecular nulls, and missense substitutions in the protease domain that affected over 25% of the genotyped population.

Secondary infection rates and antibiotic prescribing in a COVID-19 HDU population,Zhang S.H.; Bickler G.; Porter B.; Hallifax R.; Rahman N.; Flight W. ,"Introduction: Secondary infection in COVID-19 has been associated with adverse outcomes and high mortality. The prevalence of secondary infection in COVID-19 and optimal antimicrobial strategies remain unclear. Method(s): Retrospective case-note review of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our institution's high dependency unit (HDU) from March to June 2020. Patients were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had classical CT appearances and a compatible clinical presentation for COVID-19. Microbiological tests, antimicrobial prescriptions and clinical outcomes were recorded. Result(s): 84 patients were identified. Median age was 68.5 years and 29/84 (34.5%) were female. Respiratory support included HFNO (n=39), CPAP (n=56), non-invasive ventilation (n=3) and invasive ventilation (n=14). Overall mortality was 36/84 (42.9%). 6/84 patients (7.1%) had evidence of secondary infection (>105 CFUs on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); positive sputum culture or positive blood culture excluding skin contaminants). 28/84 (33.3%) had a respiratory sample sent: BAL n=10; sputum culture n=2; Legionella antigen n=15; throat swab multiplex PCR n=3; Biofire respiratory viral panel n=7. BAL was positive in 3/10 cases (Enterococcus faecium; Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa). One sputum culture was positive for M. abscessus. 71/84 (84.5%) had blood cultures. 8 (11.2%) were positive, of which 6 were considered skin contaminants and not deemed true secondary infection (coagulase negative Staphylococci n=5; Lysinibacillus sp. n=1; Proteus mirabilis n=1; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Serratia marcescens n=1). All 84 patients received antimicrobials. 32 (38.1%) received a macrolide, predominantly azithromycin. Macrolide usage was not associated with mortality or admission length, but was associated with increased intubation rate (28.1% vs 9.6%, p=0.027) Initial antibiotic treatment was monotherapy in 45 (53.6%) cases and dual therapy in 39 (46.4%).

Discussion(s): Robust evidence of secondary infection in patients with COVID-19 was uncommon in our cohort.

Comparing vitamin d levels in patients with COVID-19 and tuberculosis infection,Essaji N.; Fanshawe J.B.; Mohajer T.; Baker L.V. ,"Introduction: Vitamin D is important in innate and adaptive immunity. Deficiency is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis(TB) and viral respiratory tract infections. Prevalence increases in patients of Black and Asian ethnicity, high BMI, smokers and the elderly. Vitamin D deficiency may have a role in acquisition and severity of COVID-19 infection. Objective To investigate vitamin D status in patients admitted to hospital and critical care with COVID-19, and to compare vitamin D levels to patients with TB infection. Method(s): Vitamin D levels were measured prospectively in adult patients admitted to three medical wards and HDU/ITU with suspected COVID-19 infection between 6/4/20 and 4/5/20. Data was supplemented by retrospectively screening admissions between 1/3/20 and 31/5/20 with PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection or highly suggestive chest radiology with a Vitamin D level within 3 months. Adult patients treated for latent and active TB between 1/1/18 to 30/6/20 had Vitamin D levels measured at treatment start. Patients were stratified as Vitamin D deficient(<25 nmol), insufficient(26-50 nmol) or sufficient(>50 nmol). Result(s): Vitamin D levels were available for 244/551(44%) patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19, including 62/113(55%) ITU/HDU admissions, and for 230/237(97%) TB patients. Overall, 195/244(76%) inpatients with COVID-19 had vitamin D <50 nmol (104/244(43%) deficient and 81/244(33%) insufficient, median 29 nmol), compared with 177/230(77%) patients with TB infection (79/230(34%) deficient and 98/230(43%) insufficient, median 34.2 nmol).

Can we diagnose asthma using standard nonaerosol generating procedures?,Drake S.; Roberts S.; Willmore L.; Lowe L.; Kerry G.; Fowler S.J. ,"Objective: Asthma diagnostic guidelines from NICE mandate up to five tests in a sequential algorithm, three of which are aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) [spirometry, reversibility (BDR), bronchial challenge testing (BCT)]. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in significant restrictions to AGPs, highlighting the urgent need for an alternative diagnostic model. We aimed to develop a 'rule-in' diagnostic model using non AGPs [chest auscultation, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), two week-peak flow variability (PEFv) and serum eosinophils (eos)] which would enable GPs to confidently diagnose asthma in a subgroup of patients and reduce the need for AGPs and onward referral. Method(s): Symptomatic but untreated patients with physician-suspected asthma were referred into the RADicA (Rapid Access Diagnostics in Asthma) study. Patients underwent clinical consultation followed by tests including FeNO, spirometry, BDR, PEFv, BCT, and eos. Asthma diagnosis was made on the basis of all available information (including response to eight weeks inhaled corticosteroid treatment) by a panel of respiratory physicians. Data from patients coded as 'definite asthma' or 'not asthma' were evaluated, individually and in combination in order to investigate which non-AGP tests could predict asthma. PEFv was classified as a non-AGP because it is not performed in the clinical setting. Result(s): Of 61 symptomatic adults [median (IQR) age 32(26-44)yrs, 62% female] 61% had 'definite asthma' by expert panel decision. Each of the four non-AGP tests were able to predict asthma with low sensitivity and high specificity (figure 1). Using established cut-offs (PEFv>20%, FeNO>=40ppb, eos>0.4 x 109/L), an algorithm which simply required the presence of two or more positive tests was able to 'rule-in' asthma with a specificity (95% CI) of 100(78-100)%, sensitivity 20(8-39)%. In comparison using all available tests required for the NICE algorithm resulted in a sensitivity of 53(34-72)%, specificity 100(79-100)%. Conclusion(s): Four simple non-AGPs could be used in primary care to accurately diagnose asthma.

Shared decision making in pulmonary rehabilitation: A qualitative needs assessment,Barradell A.C.; Larkin M.; Singh S.J. ,"Introduction: and Objectives: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based treatment for patients with COPD. However, the national audit reveals significant under-referral and uptake to the programme,1 which will likely continue during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of restrictions to PR delivery. At University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust (UHL) a choice of centre-based and home-based programmes exist to support individual patient needs but are not routinely offered at referral. To support referral and uptake to PR, exploring the barriers and facilitators to the current approach and a new menu-based approach to PR is warranted. Method(s): Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with respiratory healthcare professionals (rHCPs) who refer patients with COPD to PR and COPD patients who were PR naive and had received a referral. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using The Enhanced Critical Incident Technique.2 Categories were generated to reflect helping, hindering and wish list items, then validated and reviewed by a collaborating and independent expert. (Figure presented) Results: 22 participants were recruited (rHCPs=14; COPD patients=8). 276 critical incidents generated 108 hindering, 108 helping and 60 wish list categories. The identified mediators of PR engagement were: Understanding PR/menu-based programmes, Perceived ability to access PR, A desire to accept PR, A referring practitioner's support of PR, and Understanding COPD (see figure 1). Conclusion(s): The menu-based approach offers increased opportunity for patients to engage in PR particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its poor identity limits its feasibility and acceptability.

Delivering a community-based COVID-19 rehabilitation service using existing pulmonary rehabilitation teams is safe and feasible,Donaldson K.; Brenton A.; Haslam P.; Turner N.; Talbot J.; Newsham J.; Clarke F.; Kinley A.; Prior K. ,"Background: University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, witnessed an early peak of COVID-19 with related hospital admissions in early 2020, this created a need for a coordinated approach to post COVID-19 rehabilitation needs across the area. Objective(s): A three-armed COVID-19 rehabilitation pathway was devised in March 2020 with Arm 1 aiming to assess and address the immediate rehabilitation needs of those leaving hospital following an admission for respiratory complications of COVID-19. Method(s): Existing Pulmonary Rehabilitation teams were repur-posed by integrated care network (MBRN) to be a new 'Virtual' rehabilitation service. A register of patients discharged from hospital sites was remotely screened for pathway suitability. Then, using a multi-professional template a holistic assessment needs was conducted using telephone and/or home visit consultations. Clinical assessment tools were built into the assessment process. Weekly 'acute-community' virtual in-service training sessions and multi-disciplinary case discussions supported the clinicians. (Figure presented) Results: To date 207 patients have entered the service for virtual triage, 138 patients were deemed suitable for further assessment and interventions. 427 direct clinician consultations were delivered to these 138 patients [122 initial telephone assessments; 53 initial home visit assessments; 168 follow-up telephone consultations; 84 follow-up home visits]. Two of the 138 patients assessed died, both were expected deaths. No clinical incidents occurred and no staff contracted COVID-19 during this period. Feedback from the services' staff survey was very positive highlighting the supportive value of virtual training and MDT and the enjoyment of being part of creating and delivering this new service to patients recovering from COVID-19. Conclusion(s): Utilising the skills of pulmonary rehabilitation staff to deliver a holistic rehabilitation and treatment service to those discharged from hospital after suffering respiratory complications of COVID-19 was feasible, safe and well tolerated by staff and patients.

Benralizumab is effective at reducing airway inflammation in severe asthma patients following non-response to mepolizumab associated with persistent sputum eosinophilia,Tavernier G.; Aspin P.; Holmes L.J.; Elsey L.; Niven R.; Pantin C.T.; Allen D.; Fowler S.J. ,"Background: Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies reduce systemic corticosteroid use, exacerbation rate, and airway inflammation in severe asthma. Different effectors of the eosinophil IL-5 pathway are targeted, but algorithms to choose the most appropriate biologic for each patient are still being refined. Our team regularly monitors severe asthma patients' airway inflammation using sputum eosinophils. Aim(s): To investigate clinical outcomes of patients that switched to benralizumab after non-response to mepolizumab associated with persistent sputum eosinophilia. Method(s): We prospectively monitored sputum cell counts of patients starting MDT-approved benralizumab after: * failing to respond to mepolizumab, * and whose positive sputum eosinophils remained above the threshold of 3%. Additional clinical parameters were recorded including corticosteroid dose, ACQ, AQLQ, and blood eosinophils. Lung function testing was severely impacted by the COVID pandemic. Result(s): Fifty-one of 183 (27.9%) mepolizumab patients to date have been identified as candidates for a switch of therapy with residual positive sputum eosinophils, of which 44 have received their first doses of benralizumab and 16 have completed 6 months of treatment with available sputum eosinophil results. After 6 months on benralizumab therapy, clinically and statistically significant improvements in ACQ and mAQLQ were observed compared to baseline. (Table presented) All but two patients had negative sputum eosinophils (< 3%) compared to levels on mepolizumab (Table). Both also had elevated blood eosinophils: one patient was sampled during an exacerbation, the other is being investigated for parasitic infestation due to frequent foreign travels. At baseline 81% of patients were taking maintenance oral corticosteroids compared to 44% at 6 months (NS). Conclusion(s): More than a quarter of patients failed to respond to mepolizumab and displayed persistent airway eosinophilia. Of these, 88% achieved negative airway inflammation on benralizumab with significant clinical improvement (ACQ, AQLQ) and clinically (though not statistically on this small sample size) significant fall of OCS. Benralizumab appears to prove effective at reducing inflammation at tissue level in patients previously unable to achieve this on a different anti-IL-5 therapy. As more patients progress through their treatment, repeat monitoring at 12 months will establish if this benefit is maintained and is associated with long term steroid dose reduction, and exacerbation rate.",2021,/,Thorax,76,SUPPL 1,A82-A83,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2020-BTSabstracts.142,634543727,#92162,Tavernier 2021,"",""
Acute pulmonary emboli and COVID-19,Johl N.; Ap-Emyr D.; Jones M.; Hardingham K.; King E.; Carder C.; Marin A.; Corscadden C.; Pink K.; Underwood J. ,"Introduction: An increased risk of pulmonary emboli (PE) has been reported in COVID-19 disease, possibly as a result of a hypercoagulable state. Superadded PE's may exacerbate respiratory failure and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to review the detection rates for PE in patients with COVID-19 undergoing CTPA scanning. Secondary objectives were to explore correlations between PE diagnosis, serum markers and radiological COVID-19 severity. Method(s): A total of 325 patients had a CTPA performed between 30/03/2020-15/05/2020. Data was retrospectively collected on patient demographics, COVID-19 status, radiological severity (British Society of Thoracic Imaging classification), PE location and biochemical markers (D-Dimer, Troponin-I, CRP, Ferritin). Result(s): 122/325 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 either radiologically (n=20, 16%) or by RT-PCR (n=102, 84%). The PE detection rate on imaging was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 than those without (32/122 [26%] and 27/203 [13%] respectively [p=0.005]). 617 patients were hospitalised with COVID-19 during this period (total PE incidence 5.2% [32/617]). Radiological severity of COVID-19 lung disease was not associated with PE detection (p=0.94). Initial quantitative D-Dimer's were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with PE than those without (median 4390 [range 761-20,000] and 930 [range 110-20,000] respectively [p<0.001]). Higher D-Dimer levels were associated with increased PE detection rates on CT imaging (Abstract P253 figure 1). COVID-19 associated PE's were more likely to be unilateral (16/32 compared to 5/27 in COVID-19 negative group [p=0.025]) and trended towards more distal vessels (p=0.09). Accounting for age, an additional PE diagnosis did not significantly affect in-hospital COVID-19 mortality (OR 1.54 [CI 0.52-3.94], [p=0.38]). Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate increased detection of PE in COVID-19. Emboli are more likely to be unilateral, and more distally located. We postulate this may be due to higher rates of in-situ thrombosis rather than distant embolisation of clots. The radiological severity of COVID-19 lung disease does not appear to be strongly linked to PE detection rates which may suggest the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 is independent from the inflammatory lung process. Patients with (Figure presented) COVID-19 and co-existent PE's have significantly higher D-Dimer's, and further evaluation is needed into their use as a screening tool.",2021,/,Thorax,76,SUPPL 1,A226-A227,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/thorax-2020-BTSabstracts.397,634543716,#92161,Johl 2021,"",""
"Evaluation of myCOPD, a digital self-management technology for people with COPD, in a remote and rural population",Cooper R.J.; Colligan J.; Hamilton S.; Finlayson E.; Duffy M.; Gilliatt J.; Swanson M.; Giangreco A.; Sage E.K. ,"Aim: The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in poor, remote, and rural populations is twice that of cities (15.4% versus 8.4%).1 COPD costs the NHS an estimated 1.9bn/year2 and is characterised by exacerbation frequency and severity. Disease education and self-management are critical to reducing the healthcare burden for patients with COPD. We evaluated myCOPD, a digital self-management technology in a predominantly remote and rural population. We (Figure presented) assessed whether myCOPD was effective in reducing hospital admissions, inpatient bed days and other NHS service usage. Method(s): 120 people were recruited over 6 months. We compared data regarding hospital admissions, inpatient bed days, clinic attendances, out of hours contacts and home visits 12 months before and up to 12 months after myCOPD activation. To account for differences in activation rates and the early termination of the study due to COVID-19 data was reported as daily outcome measures. Result(s): The average participant age was 67, with a GOLD score 1-4 (average 2.7). The average 6-fold urban-rural score was 4.23 indicating a predominantly remote and/or rural population. 78% of patients activated myCOPD, 70% recorded their symptom score at least once, and 45% used >1 myCOPD module. There was no association between myCOPD use and participant demographics. There were no statistically significant differences in hospital admissions, inpatient bed days, or other health service utilisation before and after myCOPD activation. However, a subgroup analysis found that those individuals with the greatest degree of myCOPD engagement either by frequency of symptom scoring (figure 1A) or by numbers of modules used (figure 1B) did show a reduction in bed days. Conclusion(s): These data indicate no association between myCOPD use and either reduced bed days or other NHS service use on a whole group level however it may be of benefit to individuals with higher levels of engagement.

COVID-19 and associated disruptions may indirectly affect HIV outcomes in two capital cities in Western/Central Africa: A modelling study,Silhol R.; Geidelberg L.; Mitchell K.; Mishra S.; Bowring A.; Mukandavire C.; Behanzin L.; Guedou F.; Diabate S.; Dimitrov D.; Maheu-Giroux M.; Ronn M.; Soni N.; Njindam I.M.; Billong S. ,"Background: HIV prevalence has declined in Cotonou (Benin) and Yaounde (Cameroon) following the scale-up of HIV prevention/treatment (40% of people living with HIV are virally suppressed) and increases in condom use. The COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it may disrupt HIV services such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery and condom distribution, but this negative impact could be attenuated by temporary decreases in sexual risk behaviours due to compulsory social distancing or reduced access to commercial sex. We explored the potential effects of these changes on HIV outcomes in the two cities. Method(s): We used deterministic mathematical models of HIV transmission calibrated to available city-specific demographic, behavioural, and HIV epidemic data. We calculated the relative difference in 1-year cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths (median, 95% uncertainty interval), between a base-case scenario assuming no COVID-19 and combined scenarios assuming no ART initiations, a 10/ 25/50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment services, and decreased numbers of casual/commercial sexual partnerships over a 6-month period. Result(s): An estimated 50% increase in new HIV infections (Figure 1ab) and 20% increase in HIV-related deaths (Figure 1c-d) would be induced by combined 6-month 50% reductions in HIV prevention/ treatment use (red boxes). The estimated increase in new HIVinfections would be much lower (2-fold in Yaounde, 3-fold in Cotonou) but still substantial (20% to 30%) if 50% decreases in casual/commercial partnerships occur, with the impact on HIV-related deaths remaining high (dark-blue boxes). The estimated impact on new infections and HIV deaths is similar in the two cities but uncertain. Conclusion(s): A temporary reduction in HIV prevention/treatment services may have substantial impact on HIV outcomes in these two West/Central African cities, which would only be partially offset by people having fewer casual and commercial sexual partnerships.

Several studies have shown the benefits of tracheostomy in reducing length of stay (LoS) and duration of mechanical ventilation. As a result, it was recognised the use of tracheostomy would facilitate increased ICU capacity during the COVID-19 surge. The primary aim of this investigation is to report on clinical outcomes in adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 requiring tracheostomy over the time period March 2020 to July 2020, at three University College London Partner organisations. Method(s): A prospective multi-centre observational study was undertaken from 17th March 2020 to 3rd July 2020 on all tracheostomised COVID-19 positive patients (aged > 16 yrs). Patients with long term tracheostomies were excluded. Data were collected by multiprofessional ventilation weaning teams. Data collected included; initial diagnosis, indication for tracheostomy, tube insertion procedure, type of tube, tube changes, complications, decannulation, time to first cuff deflation/speaking valve and patient outcomes. Result(s): 139 patients were included. Mean(SD) age 58.3(11.01) with a higher proportion of male:female (M:F 108:31). The primary indication for tracheostomy was prolonged ventilation (n=111, 79%). The secondary indication was low arousal (n=16, 11%). A higher prevalence of surgery tracheostomies was found (n=89, 63%). The mean(SD) time from intubation to tracheostomy insertion was 21(9)days. The mean(SD) days to first cuff deflation was 34(14). The mean(SD) ICU LoS was 39(16)days and total hospital LoS was 51 (22) days. The mean(SD) time to decannulation from tracheostomy insertion was 25(16)days and time to decannulation from intubation was 46(18)days. A mortality rate of 10%(n=14) was observed. There was no correlation between ICU LoS and age (r=-0.022) (p=0.804). There was a weak significant correlation between ICU LoS and timing of tracheostomy (r=0.393, p<=0.0001). Conclusion(s): The low mortality rate suggests appropriate patient selection for tracheostomy, but also makes analysis of potential influences on mortality difficult to ascertain.

This study reports epidemiologic, clinical and immunological evaluations in a cohort of HIV-infected young patients followed at the Unit of Paediatric Infectious Disease at Sacco Hospital, Milan. Method(s): 72 HIV-infected young patients (31 M/41 F) were enrolled in the study. Real-time PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 on sputum and plasma samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgG (Euroimmun). RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the anti-viral immune response was performed on PBMCs upon stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as with Aldrithiol- 2-inactivated HIV (Quantigene Plex Gene expression assay). Secreted cytokines/chemokines were quantified on plasma and cell culture supernatants (Multiplex Cytokine Array). Result(s): HIV-infection was vertically transmitted in all but 5 of the patients enrolled. Mean age was 21.7 years (range 1 to 37 years); HIV-RNA < 20 cp/ml in 67 on 72 patients; the mean of CD4 T cells was 741 mm3 (range 187 to 2554 mm3). All the HIV-infected patients were undergoing antiretroviral treatments with INI (33), PI (28), or NNRTI (11).

Published data infers considerable heterogeneity, with 80% suffering minimal symptoms but a minority developing life-threatening disease. COVID 19 trials to-date have been necessarily broad but the emergence of established therapies (e.g. Dexamethasone) and distinct phenotypes (e.g. immune activated, prothrombotic) suggests that early stratification to licensed or trial agents might result in improved outcomes. The ASTERIX study aims to define disease endotypes, based on baseline biological signatures associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, development of respiratory failure and death, which could be targeted in future trials. Method(s): >6,000 samples of blood, urine and respiratory secretions were collected and banked during the first wave of the COVID 19 pandemic in Glasgow. The cohort is organised into Tiers 0, 1 & 2 with each tier having an increasing number of samples available for downstream translational research. All tiers have the same associated comprehensive clinical data including comorbidity, ethnicity, blood results, imaging, prescription data and outcomes, including critical care support and survival. Result(s): Tier 0 contains 1,512 cases, Tier 1 (defined by having at least one surplus sample banked for downstream assays) contains ~1000 cases. Tier 2 (defined as having matched samples of serum, plasma and a buffy coat) contains 421 cases.

Development of a novel risk score for the prediction of critical illness amongst COVID-19 patients,Bellos I.; Lourida P.; Argyraki A.; Korompoki E.; Zirou C.; Kokkinaki I.; Pefanis A. ,"Objectives: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with various clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical illness. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 patients and construct a predictive model for the discrimination of patients at risk of disease progression. Method(s): A single-centre cohort study was conducted including consecutively patients with COVID-19. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings were prospectively collected at admission. The primary outcome of interest was the intensive care unit admission. A risk model was constructed by applying a Cox's proportional hazard's model with elastic net penalty. Its diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and was compared with conventional pneumonia severity scores. Result(s): From a total of 67 patients 15 progressed to critical illness. The risk score included patients' gender, presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, fever, shortness of breath, serum glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen. Its predictive accuracy was estimated to be high (area under the curve: 97.1%), performing better than CURB-65, CRB-65 and PSI/PORT scores. Its sensitivity and specificity were estimated to be 92.3% and 93.3%, respectively, at the optimal threshold of 1.6. Conclusion(s): A10-variable risk score was constructed based on clinical and laboratory characteristics in order to predict critical illness amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients, achieving better discrimination compared with traditional pneumonia severity scores.

Incorporation of Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin and Computed Tomography Quantification to Predict Acute Kidney Injury and In-Hospital Death in COVID-19 Patients,He L.; Zhang Q.; Li Z.; Shen L.; Zhang J.; Wang P.; Wu S.; Zhou T.; Xu Q.; Chen X.; Fan X.; Fan Y.; Wang N. ,"Background: The prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is high, with poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 patients who are at risk for AKI and may develop critical illness and death is of great importance. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model of AKI and in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19, incorporating the new tubular injury biomarker urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest computed tomography (CT) analysis. Method(s): A single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included in this study. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and AI-assisted chest CT imaging variables identified on hospital admission were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to develop a model for predicting the AKI risk. The accuracy of the AKI prediction model was measured using the concordance index (C-index), and the internal validity of the model was assessed by bootstrap resampling. A multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for survival analysis in COVID-19 patients. Result(s): One hundred seventy-four patients were included. The median (+/-SD) age of the patients was 63.59 +/- 13.79 years, and 83 (47.7%) were men.u-NGAL, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and CT ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume were independent predictors of AKI, and all were selected in the nomogram. The prediction model was validated by internal bootstrapping resampling, showing results similar to those obtained from the original samples (i.e., 0.958; 95% CI 0.9097-0.9864). The C-index for predicting AKI was 0.955 (95% CI 0.916-0.995). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed that a high u-NGAL level, an increased GGO volume, and lymphopenia are strong predictors of a poor prognosis and a high risk of in-hospital death. Conclusion(s): This model provides a useful individualized risk estimate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. Measurement of u-NGAL and AI-based chest CT quantification are worthy of application and may help clinicians to identify patients with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 at an early stage.Copyright © 2021 S.

No patient required hospitalization and no adrenal crisis was reported. Few nasopharyngeal swabs were performed (n = 12), as indicated by sanitary regulations, limiting conclusions on the exact infection rate (2 positive results in AI and none in controls, P = 0.52). CONCLUSION(S): AI patients who are adequately treated and trained seem to display the same incidence of COVID-19-suggestive symptoms and disease severity as controls.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Risk Factors and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,Cheng Y.; Zhang N.; Luo R.; Zhang M.; Wang Z.; Dong L.; Li J.; Zeng R.; Yao Y.; Ge S.; Xu G. ,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths worldwide. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and in-hospital outcomes of AKI in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective observational study in the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, which was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by the Wuhan government. AKI was defined and staged based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Mild AKI was defined as stage 1, and severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or stage 3. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate AKI risk factors, and Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality. Result(s): A total of 119 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The median patient age was 70 years (interquartile range, 59-77) and 61.3% were male. Fifty-one (42.8%) patients developed AKI during hospitalization, corresponding to 14.3% in stage 1, 28.6% in stage 2 and 18.5% in stage 3, respectively. Compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI had a higher proportion of mechanical ventilation mortality and higher in-hospital mortality. A total of 97.1% of patients with severe AKI received mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was up to 79.4%. Severe AKI was independently associated with high in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.06-3.13). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum interleukin-8 (OR: 4.21; 95% CI: 1.23-14.38), interleukin-10 (OR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.04-10.59) and interleukin-2 receptor (OR: 4.50; 95% CI: 0.73-6.78) were risk factors for severe AKI development. Conclusion(s): Severe AKI was associated with high in-hospital mortality, and inflammatory response may play a role in AKI development in critically ill patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 S.

Vitamin D Status in Hospitalized Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,Hernandez J.L.; Nan D.; Fernandez-Ayala M.; Garcia-Unzueta M.; Hernandez-Hernandez M.A.; Lopez-Hoyos M.; Munoz-Cacho P.; Olmos J.M.; Gutierrez-Cuadra M.; Ruiz-Cubillan J.J.; Crespo J.; Martinez-Taboada V.M. ,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients is a matter of debate. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity. METHOD(S): Retrospective case-control study of 216 COVID-19 patients and 197 population-based controls. Serum 25OHD levels were measured in both groups. The association of serum 25OHD levels with COVID-19 severity (admission to the intensive care unit, requirements for mechanical ventilation, or mortality) was also evaluated. RESULT(S): Of the 216 patients, 19 were on vitamin D supplements and were analyzed separately. In COVID-19 patients, mean +/- standard deviation 25OHD levels were 13.8 +/- 7.2 ng/mL, compared with 20.9 +/- 7.4 ng/mL in controls (P < .0001). 25OHD values were lower in men than in women. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (P < .0001). 25OHD inversely correlates with serum ferritin (P = .013) and D-dimer levels (P = .027). Vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, raised serum ferritin and troponin levels, as well as a longer length of hospital stay than those with serum 25OHD levels >=20 ng/mL. No causal relationship was found between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity as a combined endpoint or as its separate components. CONCLUSION(S): 25OHD levels are lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in population-based controls and these patients had a higher prevalence of deficiency. We did not find any relationship between vitamin D concentrations or vitamin deficiency and the severity of the disease.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Factors associated with the psychological well-being among front-line nurses exposed to COVID-2019 in China: A predictive study,Li X.; Zhou Y.; Xu X. ,"AIMS: To evaluate psychological well-being and factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among front-line nurses during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 is a pandemic that has posed a public health emergency of international concern. Psychological well-being of front-line nurses is a big concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): With a predictive study design, a same survey was sent separately at two time points (i.e. before and after nurses worked at COVID-19 units) between January and March 2020 among 356 front-line nurses in First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Anhui, China. RESULT(S): Of a total 356 front-line nurses, stress level and the prevalence of PTSD were significantly increased after they worked at COVID-19 units. Nurses who had work experience less than 2 years were significantly associated with a high risk of developing PTSD. Nurses who worked in COVID-19 inpatients wards had significantly higher odds of being PTSD (odds ratio [OR] = 21.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.08; 94.5) than those who worked in other COVID-19-related units. Resilience was negatively associated with PTSD (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93; 0.99). CONCLUSION(S): Nurses had significantly increased risk to develop PTSD during COVID-19 pandemic.

We hereby report a case of a probable vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-19 from an infected pregnant female to her neonate. The transmission has been confirmed by a positive RT-PCR at 16h of life along with a positive IgG antibody test for SARS-CoV-19 in the baby and after excluding the possible environmental contamination of the sample.

Racial Disparities in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality Are Driven by Unequal Infection Risks,Zelner J.; Trangucci R.; Naraharisetti R.; Cao A.; Malosh R.; Broen K.; Masters N.; Delamater P. ,"BACKGROUND: As of 1 November 2020, there have been >230 000 deaths and 9 million confirmed and probable cases attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race/ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. METHOD(S): We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULT(S): In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than for Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 (age-standardized incidence, 1626/100 000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate, 244/100 000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% posterior credible interval [CrI], 5.4-5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI, 6.4-7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSION(S): This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community, and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Alternative to traditional noninvasive ventilation using a modified snorkel mask in a patient with SARS-COV2: A case report,Montalvo R.; Castro E.; Chavez A. ,"Introduction: The lack of mechanical ventilators for patients with COVID-19 has necessitated the use of other noninvasive ventilation (NIV) systems. One of these NIV systems is the use of an adapted snorkel mask with inspiration valves and pressure valve (PEEP). Case and outcomes: A 48-year-old man with no previous history of lung disease was admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-COV2. The patient did not improve saturation with the use of the reservoir mask. Oxygenation was started using an adapted snorkel mask with a PEEP valve with an alveolar recruitment function and double oxygen flow. The patient presented clinical and radiological improvement after 2 days of use and was discharged 16 days later. Discussion(s): The use of a snorkel mask is an important, viable, and simpler NIV modality for the management of patients with COVID-19 with respiratory failure who fail to use a reservoir mask, and it can be an alternative before the use of a mechanical ventilator. Conclusion(s): The use of the adapted snorkel mask with Charlotte valve and PEEP is a feasible alternative for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists.

Low ADAMTS13 Activity Correlates with Increased Mortality in COVID-19 Patients,Sweeney J.M.; Barouqa M.; Krause G.J.; Gonzalez-Lugo J.D.; Rahman S.; Gil M.R. ,"The causes of coagulopathy associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between von Willebrand factor (VWF) biomarkers, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID-19 patients and study their association with disease severity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study of 181 hospitalized COVID-19 patients randomly selected with balanced distribution of survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who died had significantly lower ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, significantly increased shistocyte/RBC fragment counts, and significantly elevated VWF antigen and activity levels compared with patients discharged alive. These biomarkers correlate with markedly elevated D-dimers. Additionally, only 30% of patients who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 43% on admission survived, yet 60% of patients survived who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of greater than 43% on admission. In conclusion, COVID-19 may present with low ADAMTS13 activity in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes/RBC fragment and elevated D-dimer on admission may warrant a work-up for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen and activity levels.

Update in Viral Infections in the Intensive Care Unit,Fragkou P.C.; Moschopoulos C.D.; Karofylakis E.; Kelesidis T.; Tsiodras S. ,"The advent of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques has improved our ability to detect viral pathogens leading to severe and often fatal infections that require admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Viral infections in the ICU have pleomorphic clinical presentations including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, central or peripheral nervous system manifestations, and viral-induced shock. Besides de novo infections, certain viruses fall into latency and can be reactivated in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent critically ill patients. Depending on the viral strain, transmission occurs either directly through contact with infectious materials and large droplets, or indirectly through suspended air particles (airborne transmission of droplet nuclei). Many viruses can efficiently spread within hospital environment leading to in-hospital outbreaks, sometimes with high rates of mortality and morbidity, thus infection control measures are of paramount importance. Despite the advances in detecting viral pathogens, limited progress has been made in antiviral treatments, contributing to unexpectedly high rates of unfavorable outcomes. Herein, we review the most updated data on epidemiology, common clinical features, diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of severe community- and hospital-acquired viral infections in the ICU settings.© Copyright © 2021 Fragkou, Moschopoulos, Karofylakis, Kelesidis and Tsiodras.",2021,/,Frontiers in Medicine,8,"(Fragkou, Moschopoulos, Karofylakis, Tsiodras) 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University Hospital, Athens, Greece(Kelesidis) Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Med",575580,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.575580,634407701,#92231,Fragkou 2021,"",""
COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: from pathophysiology to clinical management,Lim S.; Bae J.H.; Kwon H.-S.; Nauck M.A. ,"Initial studies found increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",2021,/,Nature Reviews Endocrinology,17,1,11-30,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41574-020-00435-4,2007294099,#92212,Lim 2021,"",""
COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory disease in an adult,Sokolovsky S.; Soni P.; Hoffman T.; Kahn P.; Scheers-Masters J. ,"Recent reports have described a secondary Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) after a prior COVID-19 infection that often has features of Kawasaki disease (KD). Here, we report the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department hypotensive and tachycardic after 1 week of fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, and was found to have the classic phenotype of complete Kawasaki's Disease including nonexudative conjunctivitis, cracked lips, edema of the hands and feet, palmar erythema, a diffuse maculopapular rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial laboratory studies were significant for hyponatremia, elevated liver function tests including direct hyperbilirubinemia, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. Imaging revealed mild gallbladder wall edema, a small area of colitis, and small pleural effusion. She was treated for Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome (KDSS) with pulse dose solumedrol, IVIG, and aspirin with near resolution of symptoms and normalization of vital signs within 1 day and subsequent improvement in her laboratory abnormalities. She was later found to be COVID-19 IgG positive, suggesting past exposure. This case represents an early report of a KD-like illness in an adult with serologic evidence of a previous COVID-19 infection, similar to MIS-C. It suggests that the virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 appears to cause a post-infectious inflammatory syndrome similar to KD in adults, as well as children. Our understanding of the myriad of COVID-19 symptoms and sequelae is rapidly evolving. We recommend physicians remain vigilant for inflammatory syndromes that mimic KD/KDSS which may warrant prompt treatment with IVIG and steroids.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,American Journal of Emergency Medicine,39,"(Sokolovsky, Hoffman) Department of Emergency Medicine, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, United States(Soni) Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, United States(Kahn) Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, ",253,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.06.053,2006954417,#92211,Sokolovsky 2021,"",""

Circadian Rhythm Disturbance in Agitation of Alzheimer's Disease,Outen J.; Spira A.; Wanigatunga S.; Zipunnikov V.; Wu M.; Rosenberg P. ,"Introduction: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect nearly all individuals with AD. Agitation in AD (Agit-AD) is one of the most common NPS, with an estimated prevalence over 40%. Agit-AD is a major cause of distress and burden for AD caregivers and may be driven by disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep. In healthy individuals, the circadian clock that generates these rhythms regulates patterns in mood, wakefulness, and other physiologic processes, such as body temperature and hormone levels. Individuals with Agit-AD may experience disturbance in their circadian rhythms such that aggressive and disruptive behavior is increased. This project aims to examine if agitated AD subjects (AgitAD+) express delayed circadian phases and reduced rhythm strength as compared to non-agitated AD subjects (AgitAD-) and healthy controls. Additionally, we seek to 1) evaluate if circadian phase and rhythm strength vary between subtypes of Agit-AD (affective dysregulation vs. executive dysfunction); and to 2) compare sleep amount, sleep quality, and degree of sleep disordered breathing among AgitAD+ subjects vs. AgitAD- subjects and healthy controls. Method(s): We studied 25 subjects (Table 1): 15 AgitAD+ subjects, 8 AgitAD- subjects, and 2 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Participants completed wrist actigraphy for one week to quantify rest/activity rhythms and sleep; consumed an ingestible, disposable temperature sensor for 1-2 days to quantify core body temperature, a marker of the endogenous circadian rhythm; and completed a single night of home sleep testing (HST; Table 2). Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of AD and age 55-90 years, and exclusion criteria include seizures, significant tremors, delirium, using CPAP for sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders. NPS were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Version (NPI-C), the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS), and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Agit-AD was defined using criteria from the International Psychogeriatric Association. AgitAD+ subjects had clinically significant agitation, defined as NPI-C Agitation or Aggression subtotals >= 4. Disease progression was measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and subjects underwent a physical and neurological exam. Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Animal Naming (AN), and the Trail-Making Test (parts A & B). Sleep questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Caregivers were asked to complete a sleep diary for subjects and an agitation log over the week they completed actigraphy. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented hybrid visits with telemedicine to limit in-person interactions. Result(s): 25 subjects have completed the study to date. There were no statistically significant differences observed in actigraphy-derived sleep parameters between agitated and non-agitated AD subjects (2-group t-test); see Table 1). However, significant differences between the groups have been observed in the rest/activity rhythms: compared to subjects without agitation (AgitAD-), AgitAD+ subjects had lower levels of activity in the morning and greater activity in the afternoon and evening (Figure 1). We also have performed function-on-scalar regression (FOSR) (Goldsmith et al., 2015, Biometrics 71:344-353) using subject-specific activity profiles as outcomes and age and agitation/control status as predictors. Figure 2 shows functional effects of age on rest/activity rhythm (left panel) and the functional effect of agitation status (right panel); the red background shows times of day during which there were statistically significant differences, using the pointwise method of analysis (p<0.05). After adjustment for age, agitation was associated with lower activity in the morning period and a trend towards greater activity in the afternoon and evening period (not statistically significant). This preliminary finding may suggest that AgitAD+ subjects express lower and delayed activity rhythms. Additionally, the HST results show a trend toward less REM sleep and longer initial REM latency in the AgitAD+ group (Table 2). Updated results will be presented at AAGP (estimated 6-10 additional subjects). Conclusion(s): The collection of multimodal noninvasive data on sleep, activity, and core body temperature is feasible in agitated AD outpatients. This study could provide evidence for CRD/sleep disturbance as a driver of Agit-AD and could identify Agit-AD subtypes who are most likely to benefit from chronobiotic or sleep interventions for Agit-AD. Furthermore, this study could provide evidence for the use of actigraphy as a surrogate biomarker in proof-of-concept intervention studies targeting Agit-AD.

Protective potential of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T lymphocytes in non-infected individuals,Samocanec M.I.; Cegec I.; Radacic-Aumiler M.; ErdeljicTurk V.; Makar-Auperger K.; Likic R.; Mercep I. ,"Introduction/background &aims: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can have a very different disease course, ranging from being almost asymptomatic to developing a severe illness requiring intensive care. Several studies have so far demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells against the viral spike protein in recovered patients as well as in non-infected individuals. Method/summary of work: T-lymphocytes were taken from blood of SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients as well as from non-infected individuals, and the CD4+ T cells were evaluated for their reactivity against the viral spike protein through assessment of intracellular gammainterferon expression. Results/discussion: CD4+ reactive T lymphocytes against the SARSCoV-2 spike protein were detected in 83% (n = 15/18) of patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in 35% (n = 24/68) of controls. The T cell reactivity in non-infected individuals was greater towards the peptides at the N-terminal end of the viral spike protein than towards those at the C-terminal end, suggesting for crossreactivity with the endemic coronaviruses' spike proteins that have significant similarities at their N-terminal ends with the SARS-CoV-2. Afforded protection through cross-reactivity could potentially also explain predominantly mild or asymptomatic disease course in children who more commonly get infected with endemic coronaviruses. In another study from the United States, where similar methodology was used, between 40% and 60% of non-infected individuals had detectable CD4+ T cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in their blood. Conclusion(s): Cross-immunity through presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is likely a consequence of previous exposure to endemic coronaviruses. The extent of the afforded protection and its duration remain to be investigated.

"Effect of D614G Spike Variant on Immunoglobulin G, M, or A Spike Seroassay Performance",Klumpp-Thomas C.; Kalish H.; Hicks J.; Mehalko J.; Drew M.; Memoli M.J.; Hall M.D.; Esposito D.; Sadtler K. ,"Emergence of a new spike protein variant (D614G) with increased infectivity has prompted many to analyze its role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. There is concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of both variants, and we found that antibodies from 88 donors from a high-incidence population reacted toward both the original spike and the D614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who are exposed to either variant have cross-responsive humoral immunity.

Serum Protein Profiling Reveals a Specific Upregulation of the Immunomodulatory Protein Progranulin in Coronavirus Disease 2019,Rieder M.; Wirth L.; Pollmeier L.; Jeserich M.; Goller I.; Baldus N.; Schmid B.; Busch H.-J.; Hofmann M.; Thimme R.; Rieg S.; Kern W.; Bode C.; Duerschmied D.; Lother A. ,"BACKGROUND: Severe courses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of proinflammatory and antiviral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19. METHOD(S): In this prospective, single-center registry, we included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles. RESULT(S): IL-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (n = 24) compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of IL-6 in COVID-19. CONCLUSION(S): The data from this registry reveal that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients while IL-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Digital Health Solutions to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic in Countries With High Disease Prevalence: Literature Review,R Niakan Kalhori S.; Bahaadinbeigy K.; Deldar K.; Gholamzadeh M.; Hajesmaeel-Gohari S.; Ayyoubzadeh S.M. ,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become a global pandemic, affecting most countries worldwide. Digital health information technologies can be applied in three aspects, namely digital patients, digital devices, and digital clinics, and could be useful in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE(S): Recent reviews have examined the role of digital health in controlling COVID-19 to identify the potential of digital health interventions to fight the disease. However, this study aims to review and analyze the digital technology that is being applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the 10 countries with the highest prevalence of the disease. METHOD(S): For this review, the Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched in August 2020 to retrieve publications from December 2019 to March 15, 2020. Furthermore, the Google search engine was used to identify additional applications of digital health for COVID-19 pandemic control. RESULT(S): We included 32 papers in this review that reported 37 digital health applications for COVID-19 control. The most common digital health projects to address COVID-19 were telemedicine visits (11/37, 30%). Digital learning packages for informing people about the disease, geographic information systems and quick response code applications for real-time case tracking, and cloud- or mobile-based systems for self-care and patient tracking were in the second rank of digital tool applications (all 7/37, 19%). The projects were deployed in various European countries and in the United States, Australia, and China. CONCLUSION(S): Considering the potential of available information technologies worldwide in the 21st century, particularly in developed countries, it appears that more digital health products with a higher level of intelligence capability remain to be applied for the management of pandemics and health-related crises.Copyright ©Sharareh R Niakan Kalhori, Kambiz Bahaadinbeigy, Kolsoum Deldar, Marsa Gholamzadeh, Sadrieh Hajesmaeel-Gohari, Seyed Mohammad Ayyoubzadeh.

"Time Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wastewater during the First Pandemic Wave of COVID-19 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain",Chavarria-Miro G.; Anfruns-Estrada E.; Martinez-Velazquez A.; Vazquez-Portero M.; Guix S.; Paraira M.; Galofre B.; Sanchez G.; Pinto R.M.; Bosch A. ,"Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 million inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during, and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.",2021,/,Applied and environmental microbiology,87,7,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02750-20,634085929,#92410,Chavarria-Miro 2021,"",""

We derived and validated a new risk model for predicting progression to disease severity, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection (Gal-COVID-19 scores). METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Galicia, Spain. Data were extracted from electronic health records of patients, including age, sex and comorbidities according to International Classification of Primary Care codes (ICPC-2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of disease severity. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated to assess model performance. RESULT(S): The incidence of infection was 0.39% (10 454 patients). A total of 2492 patients (23.8%) required hospitalization, 284 (2.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 544 (5.2%) died. The variables included in the models to predict severity included age, gender and chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, chronic kidney disease and haematological cancer. The models demonstrated a fair-good fit for predicting hospitalization {AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve] 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 0.78]}, admission to ICU [AUC 0.83 (95%CI 0.81, 0.85)] and death [AUC 0.89 (95%CI 0.88, 0.90)].

The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: a Mendelian randomization study,Butler-Laporte G.; Nakanishi T.; Mooser V.; Renieri A.; Amitrano S.; Zhou S.; Chen Y.; Forgetta V.; Richards J.B. ,"BACKGROUND: There has been uncertainty about the safety or benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used Mendelian randomization using genetic determinants of serum-ACE levels to test whether decreased ACE levels increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity, while reducing potential bias from confounding and reverse causation in observational studies. METHOD(S): Genetic variants strongly associated with ACE levels, which were nearby the ACE gene, were identified from the ORIGIN trial and a separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ACE levels from the AGES cohort. The ORIGIN trial included 4147 individuals of European and Latino ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a study of 3200 Icelanders. Cohorts from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS of up to 960 186 individuals of European ancestry were used for COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severe-disease outcome. RESULT(S): Genetic variants were identified that explain between 18% and 37% of variance in ACE levels. Using genetic variants from the ORIGIN trial, a standard-deviation decrease in ACE levels was not associated with an increase in COVID-19 susceptibility [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.15], hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.08) or severe disease (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.06). Using genetic variants from the AGES cohort, the result was similar for susceptibility (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.09), hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.11) and severity (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.14). Multiple-sensitivity analyses led to similar results. CONCLUSION(S): Genetically decreased serum ACE levels were not associated with susceptibility to, or severity of, COVID-19 disease.

The epidemiology of GBS cases reported to the UK National Immunoglobulin Database was studied from 2016 to 2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were stratified by hospital trust and region, with numbers of reported cases per month. UK population data for COVID-19 infection were collated from UK public health bodies. In parallel, but separately, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society prospectively reported incident cases of GBS during the pandemic at their hospitals to a central register. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases in this cohort were compared. The incidence of GBS treated in UK hospitals from 2016 to 2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100000 individuals per year. GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-19. GBS and COVID-19 incidences during the pandemic also varied between regions and did not correlate with one another (r=0.06, 95% confidence interval: -0.56 to 0.63, P=0.86).

We sought to analyze its global impact with a survey on colorectal cancer care during the pandemic. Method(s): The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on preoperative assessment, elective surgery, and postoperative management of colorectal cancer patients was explored by a 35-item survey, which was distributed worldwide to members of surgical societies with an interest in colorectal cancer care. Respondents were divided into 2 comparator groups: (1) ""delay"" group: colorectal cancer care affected by the pandemic and (2) ""no delay"" group: unaltered colorectal cancer practice. Result(s): A total of 1,051 respondents from 84 countries completed the survey. No substantial differences in demographics were found between the delay (745, 70.9%) and no delay (306, 29.1%) groups. Suspension of multidisciplinary team meetings, staff members quarantined or relocated to coronavirus disease 2019 units, units fully dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 care, and personal protective equipment not readily available were factors significantly associated to delays in endoscopy, radiology, surgery, histopathology, and prolonged chemoradiation therapy-to-surgery intervals. In the delay group, 48.9% of respondents reported a change in the initial surgical plan, and 26.3% reported a shift from elective to urgent operations. Recovery of colorectal cancer care was associated with the status of the outbreak.

Finally, absolute eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and MO-FSC were lower in patients with CSS. Hemocytometric parameters indicative of changes in immunocompetent peripheral blood cells and measured at admission to the ED were associated with COVID-19 with and without CSS.

Where did the patients go? Changes in acute appendicitis presentation and severity of illness during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A retrospective cohort study,Neufeld M.Y.; Bauerle W.; Eriksson E.; Azar F.K.; Evans H.L.; Johnson M.; Lawless R.A.; Lottenberg L.; Sanchez S.E.; Simianu V.V.; Thomas C.S.; Drake F.T. ,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic restricted movement of individuals and altered provision of health care, abruptly transforming health care-use behaviors. It serves as a natural experiment to explore changes in presentations for surgical diseases including acute appendicitis. The objective was to determine if the pandemic was associated with changes in incidence of acute appendicitis compared to a historical control and to determine if there were associated changes in disease severity. Method(s): The study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (N = 956) presenting with appendicitis in nonpandemic versus pandemic time periods (December 1, 2019-March 10, 2020 versus March 11, 2020-May 16, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 composed the historical control. Primary outcome was mean biweekly counts of all appendicitis presentations, then stratified by complicated (n = 209) and uncomplicated (n = 747) disease. Trends in presentations were compared using difference-in-differences methodology. Changes in odds of presenting with complicated disease were assessed via clustered multivariable logistic regression. Result(s): There was a 29% decrease in mean biweekly appendicitis presentations from 5.4 to 3.8 (rate ratio = 0.71 [0.51, 0.98]) after the pandemic declaration, with a significant difference in differences compared with historical control (P =.003). Stratified by severity, the decrease was significant for uncomplicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.47-0.91]) when compared with historical control (P =.03) but not for complicated appendicitis (rate ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.52-1.52]); (P =.49). The odds of presenting with complicated disease did not change (adjusted odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 0.83-2.25]). Conclusion(s): The pandemic was associated with decreased incidence of uncomplicated appendicitis without an accompanying increase in complicated disease. Changes in individual health care-use behaviors may underlie these differences, suggesting that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve without progression to complicated disease.Copyright © 2020",2021,/,Surgery (United States),169,4,808-815,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.10.035,2010261613,#92341,Neufeld 2021,"",""
Higher severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant patients,Lokken E.M.; Taylor G.G.; Huebner E.M.; Vanderhoeven J.; Hendrickson S.; Coler B.; Sheng J.S.; Walker C.L.; McCartney S.A.; Kretzer N.M.; Resnick R.; Kachikis A.; Barnhart N.; Schulte V.; Bergam B.; Ma K.K.; Albright C.; Kelley L.; Larios V.; Emhoff S.; Rah J.; Retzlaff K.; Thomas C.; Paek B.W.; Hsu R.J.; Erickson A.; Chang A.; Mitchell T.; Hwang J.K.; Gourley R.; Erickson S.; Delaney S.; Kline C.R.; Archabald K.; Blain M.; LaCourse S.M.; Adams Waldorf K.M. ,"Background: During the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pregnancy were uncertain. Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of clinical and public health responses during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy are unknown because of incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early months of pandemic is not clearly understood. Objective(s): This study aimed to estimate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnancy and to examine the disparities by race and ethnicity and English language proficiency in Washington State. Study Design: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection diagnosed between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals and clinics, capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health region and cross-sectionally compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race and ethnicity and language used for medical care of pregnant patients were compared with recent data from Washington State. Result(s): A total of 240 pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study were as follows: (1) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate was 13.9 per 1000 deliveries in pregnant patients (95% confidence interval, 8.3-23.2) compared with 7.3 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 7.2-7.4) in adults aged 20 to 39 years in Washington State (rate ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3); (2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate reduced to 11.3 per 1000 deliveries (95% confidence interval, 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 detected through asymptomatic screening (rate ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.9); (3) the proportion of pregnant patients in non-White racial and ethnic groups with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 infection was 2- to 4-fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018; and (4) the proportion of pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of pregnant patients receiving care with limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% vs 7.6%). Conclusion(s): The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the early months of the pandemic. Moreover, the greatest burden of infections occurred in nearly all racial and ethnic minority groups. These data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggested that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine allocation in the United States similar to some states.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,,"(Lokken, LaCourse, Adams Waldorf) Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States(Lokken, McCartney, Kretzer, Kachikis, Ma, Albright, Hsu, Erickson, Hwang, Delaney, Adams Waldorf) Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Un",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.02.011,2011437557,#92924,Lokken 2021,"",""
Review article on convalescent plasma therapy for covid-19,Goyal C. ,"In December 2019, China witnessed a novel coronavirus (COVID 19) in Wuhan which eventually became a pandemic on March 11, 2020. No specific drugs, vaccines have been approved yet for its treatment as it is a novel virus, though convalescent plasma is expected to increase the survival rates and also it is easily available. Studies have shown that in every epidemic, medical professionals often use plasma because it is the only available option at that time. This passive antibody therapy has been used since the 1890s to treat emerging infections and diseases like measles, Ebola, H1N1 flu, polio, etc. Researchers at John Hopkins University were specially the first ones to get approval from the FDA for the clinical trials as in some cases of emergency, they tried plasma therapy and got success. After China and the US and several other countries showed relative improvement rates with convalescent plasma therapy, INDIA has therefore also given the go-ahead for framing a protocol to conduct a clinical trial for the same. Plasma collected from recovered COVID patients has neutralizing antibodies which are expected to reduce the duration of infec-tion. According to the scientific data, Convalescent Plasma Therapy in COVID 19 seems effective, safe and reduces death rates. Further development of improved plasma, vaccines and other therapeutic agents depends on the quick generation of data on pathogenesis and immune response of SARS-COV-2.Copyright © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.",2020,/,International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences,11,Special Issue 1,1750-1754,,http://dx.doi.org/10.26452/ijrps.v11iSPL1.4192,2006797727,#92849,Goyal 2020,"",""
Modes of transmission of covid-19,Tekam B. ,"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic as by the world health organization (WHO) in the mid-March of 2020. It is stated to be first recognized in china and has affected millions of people and many thou-sands are dead across several countries, affecting a majority of earth's pop-ulation. Exhaling activities like talking, (also coughing, and sneezing) of an infected patient is thought to be the cause of the spread of this disease trans-mitted commonly via respiratory droplets formed from these activities. As many cases affecting major areas have been identified with or without genuine travel history, a root for community transmission might have been conceiv-able. Broadly speaking transmission of COVID-19 exist by two modes-Direct and indirect. The direct mode incorporates transmission through aerosols formed by surgical and dental procedures or in the form of respiratory droplet nuclei, other body fluids and discharges, for instance, excreta, saliva, urine, semen, and tears; and from maternal-to-fetal. The indirect form of transmission includes: surfaces (e.g., furniture) also termed as fomites present within the prompt environment of an infected patient and, objects utilized on the infected individual (e.g. thermometer). A considerable lot of these modes discovered or undiscovered with evidence are overlooked, henceforth is requires to specify and delineate them.

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has antiviral properties and hence, has been used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2. Colchicine, a natural plant product is used to treat and prevent acute gout flares. Some macrolide antibiotics are reported to have fatal drug-drug interactions with colchicine. The displacement interaction between colchicine and azithromycin on binding to BSA was evaluated using spectroscopic techniques, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The binding constant recorded for the binary system BSA-colchicine was 7.44x104 whereas, the binding constant for the ternary system BSA-colchicine in presence of azithromycin was 7.38x104 and were similar. Azithromycin didn't bind to BSA neither did it interfere in binding of colchicine. The results from molecular docking studies also led to a similar conclusion that azithromycin didn't interfere in the binding of colchicine to BSA. These findings are important since there is possibility of serious adverse event with co-administration of colchicine and azithromycin in patients with underlying gouty arthritis and these patients need to be continuously monitored for colchicine toxicity.

[COVID-19 AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES].,"Dotan, Arad; Shoenfeld, Yehuda","INTRODUCTION: The immune system could be affected by a mixture of factors. It is customary to classify factors that affect the immune system into three main groups: hereditary, environmental and hormonal factors. When those factors deviate from their normal physiological effect, in the genetically pre-dispositioned, an autoimmune disease may erupt and a lymphoma may develop as a result. Viruses are a significant part of the environmental factors that affect the immune system. Recent evidence demonstrates the ability of the COVID-19 virus to induce hyper-stimulation of the immune system, thus leading to the formation of autoantibodies in patients. This effect of the COVID-19 virus is caused by two main courses of action: firstly, its ability to induce hyper-stimulation of the immune system; secondly, its molecular similarity to humans. Numerous records demonstrate the tendency of severely ill COVID-19 patients to develop multiple autoantibodies known to be found in common autoimmune diseases, such as antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and many more. Additionally, many case reports have been published on COVID-19 infected patients who developed autoimmune diseases. It is extremely important to recognize the autoimmune effects of the COVID-19 virus when dealing with the ongoing pandemic.",2021,/,Harefuah,160,2,62-67,,,33760404,#91376,Dotan 2021,"",""

"Molecular Basis for Bordetella pertussis Interference with Complement, Coagulation, Fibrinolytic, and Contact Activation Systems: the Cryo-EM Structure of the Vag8-C1 Inhibitor Complex.","Dhillon, Arun; Deme, Justin C; Furlong, Emily; Roem, Dorina; Jongerius, Ilse; Johnson, Steven; Lea, Susan M","Complement, contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis are serum protein cascades that need strict regulation to maintain human health. Serum glycoprotein, a C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), is a key regulator (inhibitor) of serine proteases of all the above-mentioned pathways. Recently, an autotransporter protein, virulence-associated gene 8 (Vag8), produced by the whooping cough pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, was shown to bind to C1-INH and interfere with its function. Here, we present the structure of the Vag8-C1-INH complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a 3.6-A resolution. The structure shows a unique mechanism of C1-INH inhibition not employed by other pathogens, where Vag8 sequesters the reactive center loop of C1-INH, preventing its interaction with the target proteases. IMPORTANCE The structure of a 10-kDa protein complex is one of the smallest to be determined using cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution. The structure reveals that C1-INH is sequestered in an inactivated state by burial of the reactive center loop in Vag8. By so doing, the bacterium is able to simultaneously perturb the many pathways regulated by C1-INH. Virulence mechanisms such as the one described here assume more importance given the emerging evidence about dysregulation of contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis leading to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Clinic-demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and high-sensitivity troponin I were extracted from the electronic database. Mortality and other clinical complications, including respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury were recorded. Myocardial injury was defined as having a serum troponin I value >19.8 ng/mL. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to determine survival times and independent predictors of mortality., RESULTS: A total of 324 patients were included. Seventy-seven patients (23.8%) had acute myocardial injury. The primary outcome measure, namely death, occurred in 54.5% and 3.2% of the patients with and without myocardial injury, respectively. Notably, 75.3% of the patients with myocardial injury and 6.5% of the patients without myocardial injury developed ARDS. Overall, 50 out of 324 patients (15.4%) died during the study period.

During the pandemic, whole genome sequencing has played an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Although an unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes have been submitted in GISAID and NCBI, data from Pakistan is scarce. We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan. The oropharyngeal swabs of patients that were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR at National Institute of Health, Pakistan, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc., MA, US) and Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US). Based on whole-genome analysis, three Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered into the 20A (GH) clade along with the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The two 19B (S)-clade strains were closely related to viruses from India and Oman. Overall, twenty-nine amino acid mutations were detected in the current study genome sequences, including fifteen missense and four novel mutations.

Worldwide, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. However, there is a need for more robust and well-designed studies to have a relevant public health intervention. Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences., METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result., RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%. The findings of this meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection was 25% (95%CI: 16-38). The leave-one out result also revealed that the weighted pooled average of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 28% and 31.4%., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, one-fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infections are remained asymptomatic throughout the course infection.

The comparison periods were March to June in 2019 and 2020. Claims data files were provided by Blue Health Intelligence, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020., Main Outcomes and Measures: Ambulatory encounters (in-person and telehealth) and allowed charges, stratified by characteristics derived from enrollment files, practitioner claims, and community characteristics linked to the enrollee's zip code., Results: A total of 36568010 individuals (mean [SD] age, 35.71 [18.77] years; 18466557 female individuals [50.5%]) were included in the analysis. In-person contacts decreased by 37% (from 1.63 to 1.02 contacts per enrollee) from 2019 to 2020. During 2020, telehealth visits (0.32 visit per person) accounted for 23.6% of all interactions compared with 0.3% of contacts in 2019. When these virtual contacts were added, the overall COVID-19 era patient and practitioner visit rate was 18% lower than that in 2019 (1.34 vs 1.64 visits per person). Behavioral health encounters were far more likely than medical contacts to take place virtually (46.1% vs 22.1%). COVID-19 prevalence in an area was associated with higher use of telehealth; patients from areas within the top quintile of COVID-19 prevalence during the week of their encounter were 1.34 times more likely to have a telehealth visit compared with those in the lowest quintile (the reference category). Persons living in areas with limited social resources were less likely to use telehealth (most vs least socially advantaged neighborhoods, 27.4% vs 19.9% usage rates).

The original and modified Caprini score equally predicts venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.,"Tsaplin, Sergey; Schastlivtsev, Ilya; Zhuravlev, Sergey; Barinov, Victor; Lobastov, Kirill; Caprini, Joseph A","OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the original Caprini score and its modifications considering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a severe prothrombotic condition in patients admitted to the hospital., METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician upon admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: 2 points for asymptomatic, 3 points for symptomatic, and 5 points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary endpoint was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary endpoints included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3+/-12.7 years old) were admitted to the hospital between 30 April and 29 May, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2-12 (5.4+/-1.8) at the admission and between 2-15 (5.9+/-2.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5-20 (10.0+/-3.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Out of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the ICU, 8 (4.8%) required IMV, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months., CONCLUSION: The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients. All models including specific COVID-19 scores showed equally high predictability, and use of the original Caprini score is appropriate for COVID-19 patients. Copyright © 2021.

Vitamin D and Its Potential Benefit for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Charoenngam, Nipith; Shirvani, Arash; Holick, Michael F","Vitamin D is known not only for its importance for bone health, but also for its biologic activities on other many other organ systems. This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against COVID-19 infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably at 40 - 60 ng/mL (100 - 150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.

Systems Dynamics and the Uncertainties of Diagnostics and Testing and Contact Tracing for COVID-19.,"Fair, Jeanne M; LeClaire, Rene; Dauelsberg, Lori; Ewers, Mary; Pasqualini, Donatella; Cleland, Tim; Rosenberger, William","The current COVID-19 pandemic contains an unprecedented amount of uncertainty and variability and thus, there is a critical need for understanding of the variation documented in the biological, policy, sociological, and infrastructure responses during an epidemic to support decisions at all levels. With the significant asymptomatic spread of the virus and without an immediate vaccine and pharmaceuticals available, the best feasible strategies for testing and diagnostics, contact tracing, and quarantine need to be optimized. With potentially high false negative test results, infected people would not be enrolled in contact-trace programs and thus, may not be quarantined. Similarly, without broad testing, asymptomatic people are not identified and quarantined. Interconnected system dynamics models can be used to optimize strategies for mitigations for decision support during a pandemic. We use a systems dynamics epidemiology model along with other interconnected system models within public health including hospitals, intensive care units, masks, contact tracing, social distancing, and a newly developed testing and diagnostics model to investigate the uncertainties with testing and to optimize strategies for detecting and diagnosing infected people. Using an orthogonal array Latin Hypercube experimental design, we ran 54 simulations each for two scenarios of 10% and 30% asymptomatic people, varying important inputs for testing and social distancing. Systems dynamics modeling, coupled with computer experimental design and statistical analysis can provide rapid and quantitative results for decision support. Our results show that widespread testing, contacting tracing and quarantine can curtail the pandemic through identifying asymptomatic people in the population. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (>=10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the pattern, appearance, and predominant distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the extent of involvement in each lobe and in the total lung volume., RESULTS: The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n=110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n=112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase (25%), whereas ground-glass opacities were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases. The median severity score was 10 (IQR: 5-13), and the scores increased as the disease progressed. The interobserver agreement (kappa) was 0.92 for the appearance, 0.84 for the distribution, 0.70 for the predominant pattern, and 0.89 for the visual score., CONCLUSION: The CT findings in patients with COVID-19 vary with the course of the infection.

The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally, making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones, providing an opportunity to integrate with contact tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic health records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within 1 h, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans., METHODS: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU., RESULTS: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk., LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Copyright © 2021.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, and its severity and extent, of voice fatigue and of dysphagia in non hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the first explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe., METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%). Grade and duration of dysphonia were positively associated with cough and rhinitis (all P values < 0.01). Voice fatigue was reported by 43/160 patients (26.8%) and its severity was correlated with dysphonia (P < 0.0001), cough (P = 0.02), rhinitis (P = 0.02), dyspnea (P < 0.001), and loss of appetite (P = 0.01). Dysphagia was encountered in 27/160 patients (16.9%) and was associated with dysgeusia, cough, arthralgia, myalgia and loss of appetite but not with dysphonia., CONCLUSIONS: Dysphonia was a highly prevalent and long-lasting symptom in this series; it has been underestimated to date.

Conference report: 34th IUSTI Europe Congress.,"Bangura, Anisa; Marriott, Amelia; Shaw, Jessica; Patel, Rajul","The 34th IUSTI European Conference was held from the 3rd to the 5th of October 2020. There were presentations on STIs in Europe, many centred on Romania. A full session was devoted to syphilis, including global efforts in syphilis vaccine development. A workshop on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation in Europe reviewed the 'PrEP gap' and the East/West divide with an additional presentation on upcoming PrEP technologies. The conference featured symposia from WHO: STIs are still increasing and with no Euro universal surveillance systems. Other symposia focused on health inequalities amongst gender and sexual minorities and the recently published changes in IUSTI guidelines on gonorrhoea, syphilis and Lymphogranuloma Venereum. SARS-CoV-2 was a focus for several plenary sessions and its possibly lasting impact on service delivery. New challenges were discussed, particularly the loss of azithromycin as a useful antimicrobial. The symposia covered latest research and work into genomics of STIs. Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionised infectious disease study, particularly infection transmission and control. There was a debate on whether 'screening and treatment of bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infection is associated with Antimicrobial Resistance and should be reconsidered', emphasising limited damage of asymptomatic infection and the possibility of emergence of rapid antibiotic resistance.

"COVID-19 related risk of in-hospital death in Silesia, Poland.","Kowalska, Malgorzata; Baranski, Kamil; Brozek, Grzegorz; Kaleta-Pilarska, Angelina; Zejda, Jan E","INTRODUCTION: The situation around COVID-19 in Poland is rapidly evolving. Because of this, it is important to investigate COVID-19 mortality and its predictors in one of the most densely populated regions of the country, the Silesian Voivodeship., OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the level of in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of sex, age, and coexisting diseases on the risk of death., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data analysis was based on discharge reports of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 in all hospitals in the region. Age, sex, hospital discharge status, and the presence of coexisting diseases were abstracted from the charts., RESULTS: In a group of 2830 COVID-19 in-patients, 325 died during hospitalization. COVID-19 deaths were associated with male sex (OR (Odds ratio), 1.52; 95%CI, 1.17-1.96), older age (OR, 6.11; 95%CI, 4.50-8.31), and the presence of three or more coexisting diseases (OR, 4.78; 95%CI, 3.52 - 6.49). The most prevalent coexisting diseases were chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases., CONCLUSION: The estimated in-hospital fatality ratio of COVID-19 was 11.5% and is smaller than the average COVID-19 fatality ratio in other European countries.

QT prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors in COVID-19.,"Koh, Hui Moon; Chong, Pei Feng; Tan, Ju Nee; Chidambaram, Suresh Kumar; Chua, Hiu Jian","WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors were widely used as off-label treatment options for COVID-19 but the safety data of these drugs among the COVID-19 population are largely lacking. Drug-induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro-arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID-19 population., METHODS: We included 446 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID-19 within a period of one month (March-April 2020). In addition to COVID-19-related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of >=470 ms in postpubertal males, and >=480 ms in postpubertal females., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person-days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro-QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ-only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc-prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11-24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66-11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ-PI combination group, having concomitant pro-QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53-9.73; p = 0.004). Four patients who had prolonged QTc intervals died but none were cardiac-related deaths., WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to the disease itself. ECG monitoring should be continued for at least a week from the initiation of treatment.

Reconciling estimates of global spread and infection fatality rates of COVID-19: an overview of systematic evaluations.,"Ioannidis, John P A","BACKGROUND: Estimates of community spread and infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 have varied across studies. Efforts to synthesize the evidence reach seemingly discrepant conclusions., METHODS: Systematic evaluations of seroprevalence studies that had no restrictions based on country and which estimated either total number of people infected and/or aggregate IFRs were identified. Information was extracted and compared on eligibility criteria, searches, amount of evidence included, corrections/adjustments of seroprevalence and death counts, quantitative syntheses and handling of heterogeneity, main estimates, and global representativeness., RESULTS: Six systematic evaluations were eligible. Each combined data from 10-338 studies (9-50 countries), because of different eligibility criteria. Two evaluations had some overt flaws in data, violations of stated eligibility criteria, and biased eligibility criteria (e.g. excluding studies with few deaths) that consistently inflated IFR estimates. Perusal of quantitative synthesis methods also exhibited several challenges and biases. Global representativeness was low with 78-100% of the evidence coming from Europe or the Americas; the two most problematic evaluations considered only 1 study from other continents. Allowing for these caveats, 4 evaluations largely agreed in their main final estimates for global spread of the pandemic and the other two evaluations would also agree after correcting overt flaws and biases., CONCLUSIONS: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15% and ~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries, and locations.

The Experience of 2 Independent Schools With In-Person Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Gillespie, Darria L; Meyers, Lauren A; Lachmann, Michael; Redd, Stephen C; Zenilman, Jonathan M","BACKGROUND: In 2020, US schools closed due to SARS-CoV-2 but their role in transmission was unknown. In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing., METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing., RESULTS: Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School-B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1400 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63 (91%) were not associated with school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff., CONCLUSIONS: Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID-19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to reopening.

Testing olfactory dysfunction in acute and recovered COVID-19 patients: a single center study in Italy.,"Pasquini, Jacopo; Maremmani, Carlo; Salvadori, Stefano; Silani, Vincenzo; Ticozzi, Nicola","BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common during acute illness and appears to last longer than other symptoms. The aim of this study was to objectively investigate olfactory dysfunction in two cohorts of patients at two different stages: during acute illness and after a median recovery of 4 months., METHODS: Twenty-five acutely ill patients and 26 recovered subjects were investigated. Acute patients had a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; recovered subjects had a positive antibody assay and a negative molecular test. A 33-item psychophysical olfactory identification test tailored for the Italian population was performed., RESULTS: Median time from symptoms onset to olfactory test was 33 days in acute patients and 122 days in recovered subjects. The former scored a significantly higher number of errors at psychophysical testing (median [IQR]: 8 [13] vs 3 [2], p < 0.001) and were more frequently hyposmic (64% vs 19%, p = 0.002). Recovered subjects reported a variable time to subjective olfactory recovery, from days up to 4 months. Participants included in the study reported no significant nasal symptoms at olfactory testing. Among recovered subject who reported olfactory loss during acute COVID-19, four (27%) were still hyposmic. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not show significant associations with olfactory dysfunction., CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-severe hospitalized patients showed a high level and frequency of olfactory dysfunction compared to recovered subjects. In the latter group, subjects who reported persisting olfactory dysfunction showed abnormal scores on psychophysical testing, indicating that, at least in some subjects, persistent hyposmia may represent a long-term sequela of COVID-19.",2021,/,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,,"drb, 100959175",,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05200-7,33768438,#91415,Pasquini 2021,"",""

Pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 (Covid 19) viral infection,Bhardwaj M. ,"The city of Wuhan located in Hubei province of central China was burdened with a series of cases presenting with atypical acute respiratory infections in December 2019. Little did people know at that point in time, that a novel virus known as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) or simply corona virus, was responsible for these peculiar presentations. COVID-19 had begun spreading at an alarm-ing rate worldwide, eventually gaining official status as a global pandemic, as affirmed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020. By 6 July 2020, globally, there were 1.5 million cases and around 536 893 deaths. As the pandemic took its toll globally, scientists struggled to classify and specify the manifestations of the virus. Medical practitioners, microbiologists and scientists worldwide gradually joined forces to define COVID-19 as an infection characterised by an immense inflammatory reaction or cytokine storm which may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dys-function (MODS). During the latter half of 2020, multiple hospitals in India, France, America, Germany and Netherlands reported an increasing incidence of fatal invasive fungal infections in recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. Increased severity of infections as well as mortality was observed in immunocompro-mised patients and those with co existing medical illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. Furthermore, even though many patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was noted that their immunity post recovery was sig-nificantly diminished, and it was during this period they were more suscep-tible to fatal bacterial and fungal co-infections.

Hypercoagulability in COVID-19: A review of the potential mechanisms underlying clotting disorders,Alam W. ,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 has emerged as a new viral pandemic, causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leading to a wide array of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure. However, coagulation disorders have been found in some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to either a clotting disorder or hemorrhage. Several mechanisms attempt to explain the mechanism behind the pro-coagulant state seen with COVID-19 patients, including different receptor binding, cytokine storm, and direct viral endothelial damage. SARS-CoV-2 has also been recently found to bind to CLEC4M receptor, a receptor that participates in the clearance of von Willebrand Factor and Factor VIII. The competitive binding of SARS-CoV-2 to CLEC4M could lead to decreased clearance, and therefore a promotion of a pro-coagulative state; however, an experimental study needs to be done to prove such an association.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,/,SAGE Open Medicine,9,"(Alam) Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20503121211002996,2010876229,#92880,Alam 2021,"",""

This study was a retrospective single-centre study involving all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the department of medicine and therapeutics, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, over the period of 13th April-28th June 2020. Twenty-two (22) patients in total fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Patients' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters outcomes as well as treatment modalities employed were extracted from their respective medical records and analyzed using STATA version 14. Dyspnoea, fever and cough were most common associated symptoms. The mean duration of admission at the ICU was 4.1 +/- 3.0 days with five deaths (22.7%). About 91% (20/22) had at least one comorbidity with hypertension as the most prevalent. The median oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2 /FiO2 ) level was significantly higher in persons with only COVID-19 pneumonia compared to those with complicated respiratory failure (p<0.001). Six (27.3%) out of the 22 patients had non-invasive ventilation, with only 1/22 (4.5%) receiving mechanical ventilation. Although non-significant, the mean duration of ICU stay was relatively shorter in patients who received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation (p=0.32). Duration of treatment with methylprednisolone was significantly associated with patient outcomes (p=0.04) and serum ferritin levels had a tendency to negatively affect outcome (p=0.06). Clearly there are still no specific targeted medications for COVID-19 treatment, except for empirically symptoms-guided treatments and management of mild to critically ill patients. Early use of systemic corticosteroids for severe to critically ill patients in the ICU using S/F ratio and CRP levels may improve outcomes.Copyright © Jane Afriyie-Mensah et al.",2021,/,Pan African Medical Journal,38,"(Afriyie-Mensah, Kwarteng, Akamah, Doku, Adjei) Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, College of Health Sciences, University of Ghana, Medical School, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana(Afriyie-Mensah, Ganu, Bondzi, Tetteh, Akamah, Doku, Adjei) Departme",107,,http://dx.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.107.27131,2006800911,#92877,Afriyie-Mensah 2021,"",""
High seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 among healthcare workers in a north italy hospital,Airoldi C.; Patrucco F.; Milano F.; Alessi D.; Sarro A.; Rossi M.A.; Cena T.; Borre S.; Faggiano F. ,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been the key players in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. Result(s): Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55-18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%). Conclusion(s): The high seroprevalence observed can be partially explained by the timing and the population seroprevalence; the study was conducted in an area with huge spread of the infection.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Diagnostic value of igm and igg detection in covid-19 diagnosis by the mobile laboratory b-life: A massive testing strategy in the piedmont region,Nyabi O.; Bentahir M.; Ambroise J.; Bearzatto B.; Chibani N.; Smits B.; Durant J.F.; Vybornov A.; Thellin O.; Moualij B.E.; Gala J.-L. ,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in 2019. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to have devastat-ing consequences for human lives and the global economy. The B-LiFe mobile laboratory in Pied-mont, Italy, was deployed for the surveillance of COVID-19 cases by large-scale testing of first responders. The objective was to assess the seroconversion among the regional civil protection (CP), police, health care professionals, and volunteers. The secondary objective was to detect asympto-matic individuals within this cohort in the light of age, sex, and residence. In this paper, we report the results of serological testing performed by the B-LiFe mobile laboratory deployed from June 10 to July 23, 2020. The tests included whole blood finger-prick and serum sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was approximately 5% (294/6013). The results of the finger-prick tests and serum sample analyses showed moderate agreement (kappa = 0.77). Furthermore, the detection rates of serum antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and S-RBD among the seroconverted individuals were positively correlated (kappa = 0.60), at least at the IgG level. Seroprevalence studies based on serological testing for the S-RBD protein or SARS-CoV-2 NP antibodies are not sufficient for diagnosis but might help in screening the population to be vaccinated and in determining the duration of seroconversion.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Linear B-cell epitope prediction for in silico vaccine design: A performance review of methods available via command-line interface,Galanis K.A.; Nastou K.C.; Papandreou N.C.; Petichakis G.N.; Pigis D.G.; Iconomidou V.A. ,"Linear B-cell epitope prediction research has received a steadily growing interest ever since the first method was developed in 1981. B-cell epitope identification with the help of an ac-curate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the COVID-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope pre-dictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely, BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Correlates of vaccine-induced protection against sars-cov-2,Koch T.; Mellinghoff S.C.; Shamsrizi P.; Addo M.M.; Dahlke C. ,"We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than two million deaths after one year of the pandemic. The world is experiencing a deep economic recession. Safe and effective vaccines are needed to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have been developed at an unprecedented speed, with more than 200 vaccine candidates currently under investigation. Among those, 20 candidates have entered the clinical Phase 3 to evaluate efficacy, and three have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of immunization is to act against infection, disease and/or transmission. However, the measurement of vaccine efficacy is challenging, as efficacy trials need to include large cohorts with verum and placebo cohorts. In the future, this will be even more challenging as further vaccine candidates will receive approval, an increasing number of humans will receive vaccinations and incidence might decrease. To evaluate novel and second-generation vaccine candidates, randomized placebo-controlled trials might not be appropriate anymore. Correlates of protection (CoP) could be an important tool to evaluate novel vaccine candidates, but vaccine-induced CoP have not been clearly defined for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we report on immunogenicity against natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine-induced immune responses and discuss immunological markers that can be linked to protection. By discussing the immunogenicity and efficacy of forerunner vaccines, we aim to give a comprehensive overview of possible efficacy measures and CoP.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

"Simultaneous cd8+ t-cell immune response against sars-cov-2 s, m, and n induced by endogenously engineered extracellular vesicles in both spleen and lungs",Ferrantelli F.; Chiozzini C.; Manfredi F.; Giovannelli A.; Leone P.; Federico M. ,"Most advanced vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 are designed to induce antibodies against spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This is a new vaccination approach based on intramuscular injection of DNA expression vectors coding for a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut ) with an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs, even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells can freely circulate into the body and are internalized by antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, EV-associated antigens can be cross-presented to prime antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a strategy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we designed DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and different viral antigens, namely N-and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. We provided evidence that all fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity became detectable in spleens and, most important, in lung airways. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lungs. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed for new anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Emerging sars-cov-2 variants and impact in global vaccination programs against sars-cov-2/covid-19,Gomez C.E.; Perdiguero B.; Esteban M. ,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants in different continents is causing a major concern in human global health. These variants have in common a higher transmissibility, becoming dominant within populations in a short time, and an accumulation of a high number of mutations in the spike (S) protein, especially within the amino terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations have direct implications on virus infection rates through higher affinity of S RBD for the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. There are also signs of enhanced virulence, re-infection frequency, and increased resistance to the action of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from convalescence sera and in vaccinated individuals in regions where the variants spread dominantly. In this review, we describe the different SARS-CoV-2 variants that have thus far been identified in various parts of the world with mutational changes and biological properties as well as their impact in medical countermeasures and human health.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Evolution of mouse hepatitis virus: Detection and characterization of spike deletion variants during persistent infection,Rowe C.L.; Baker S.C.; Nathan M.J.; Fleming J.O. ,"High-frequency RNA recombination has been proposed as an important mechanism for generating viral deletion variants of murine coronavirus. Indeed, a number of variants with deletions in the spike glycoprotein have been isolated from persistently infected animals. However, the significance of generating and potentially accumulating deletion variants in the persisting viral RNA population is unclear. To study this issue, we evaluated the evolution of spike variants by examining the population of spike RNA sequences detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice inoculated with coronavirus and sacrificed at 4, 42, or 100 days postinoculation. We focused on the S1 hypervariable region since previous investigators had shown that this region is subject to recombination and deletion. RNA isolated from the brains or spinal cords of infected mice was rescued by reverse transcription- PCR, and the amplified products were cloned and used in differential colony hybridizations to identify individual isolates with deletions. We found that 11 of 20 persistently infected mice harbored spike deletion variants (SDVs), indicating that deletions are common but not required for persistent infection. To determine if a specific type of SDV accumulated during persistence, we sequenced 106 of the deletion isolates. We identified 23 distinct patterns of SDVs, including 5 double-deletion variants. Furthermore, we found that each mouse harbored distinct variants in its central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that SDVs are generated during viral replication in the CNS. Interestingly, mice with the most severe and persisting neurological disease harbored the most prevalent and diverse quasispecies of SDVs. Overall, these findings illustrate the complexity of the population of persisting viral RNAs which may contribute to chronic disease.",1997,/,Journal of Virology,71,4,2959-2969,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jvi.71.4.2959-2969.1997,27119939,#92565,Rowe 1997,"",""

Selection of the appropriate control group is essential in evaluating the cytokine storm in COVID-19,Vassiliou A.G.; Dimopoulou I.; Jahaj E.; Keskinidou C.; Mastora Z.; Orfanos S.E.; Kotanidou A. ,"Background/Aim: Lately, studies have reported contradicting results on the cytokine storm seen in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Depending on the control group used, cytokines have been found to be higher, similar or even lower in COVID-19 compared to critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations. However, most of these studies do not take into account critical illness severity. Hence, we decided to compare cytokine levels in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and critically-ill patients of a general intensive care unit (ICU), who did not have sepsis or septic shock, but had an equal disease severity. Patients and Methods: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured on ICU admission in mechanically ventilated, COVID-19 (N=36) and non-COVID-19 (N=30) patients, who had not received dexamethasone, and had equal critical illness severity. Non-COVID-19 patients did not have sepsis or septic shock. Result(s): In our case control study, circulating IL-6 and IL-10 were lower, while TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels were higher in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, compared to critically-ill non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusion(s): It is difficult to infer whether the cytokine storm seen in COVID-19 differs from other critical conditions.

Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHOD(S): In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [>=2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020.

A role for pathogen risk factors and autoimmunity in encephalitis lethargica?,Bond M.; Bechter K.; Muller N.; Tebartz van Elst L.; Meier U.-C. ,"The encephalitis lethargica (EL) epidemic swept the world from 1916 to 1926 and is estimated to have afflicted between 80,000 to one million people. EL is an unusual neurological illness that causes profound sleep disorders, devastating neurological sequalae and, in many cases, death. Though uncommon, EL is still occasionally diagnosed today when a patient presents with an acute or subacute encephalitic illness, where all other known causes of encephalitis have been excluded and criteria for EL are met. However, it is impossible to know whether recent cases of EL-like syndromes result from the same disease that caused the epidemic. After more than 100 years of research into potential pathogen triggers and the role of autoimmune processes, the aetiology of EL remains unknown. The epidemic approximately coincided with the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic but the evidence of a causal link is inconclusive. This article reviews the literature on the causes of EL with a focus on autoimmune mechanisms. In light of the current pandemic, we also consider the parallels between the EL epidemic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Understanding how pathogens and autoimmune processes can affect the brain may well help us understand the conundrum of EL and, more importantly, will guide the treatment of patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disease, as well as prepare us for any future epidemic of a neurological illness.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,/,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,109,"(Bond) Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London E1 2AT, United Kingdom(Bechter) Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy II, Ulm University, Bezirkskrankenhaus Gunzburg, Gunzburg, Germany(Muller) Department of Psychiatry and Psychother",110276,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110276,2010982276,#92259,Bond 2021,"",""

Fatal coincidence of inapparent SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug toxicity in the field of immunosuppression in a 33-year old woman.,"Faktorova, Xenia; Horniakova, Lucia; Sedlacko, Jozef; Havranova, Alena; Martanovic, Peter; Malikova, Petra; Jakabovicova, Martina; Urkovicova, Zuzana; Szantova, Maria","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a wide-ranging form of involvement from asymptomatic through mild respiratory form to bilateral bronchopneumonia with acute respiratory and multiorgan fatal failure. Patients with comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus) are particularly at risk of a more severe course of infection. We present a 33-year old lean patient with a medical history of ulcerative colitis on immunosuppressive treatment with Azathioprine, after unsuccessful in vitro fertilization one week before the onset of symptoms, admitted to hospital for two-week-long cough with sore throat with fever ap to 40degreeC. CT confirmed bilateral bronchopneumonia without etiological detection of the infectious agent. Three PCR tests (two of nasopharyngeal swabs and one of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) were negative for COVID-19, including antigen and antibody tests. Complex parenteral ATB treatment with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was ineffective, and artificial lung ventilation was indicated for acute respiratory failure. After 4 days antifungal treatment of Fluconazole, condition of patient progressed to hepatic and multiorgan failure and the patient died on day 14 of hospitalization. Post-mortem histological examination revealed the presence of coronavirus in the cells of lung parenchyma. The case recalls that even young patients with immunosuppressive treatment are at risk for the critical course of COVID-19 disease. The negativity of the tests was due to the capture of the patient only after the second week of infection, at the time of the diagnostic window between the positive PCR test and the formation of antibodies. The persistent effect of immunosuppression was most likely the reason for the lack of antibody response.",2021,/,Vnitrni lekarstvi,67,1,51-56,,,33752392,#90880,Faktorova 2021,"",""
Shaping more resilient and just food systems: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Sanderson Bellamy, Angelina; Furness, Ella; Nicol, Poppy; Pitt, Hannah; Taherzadeh, Alice","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted weaknesses in global food systems, as well as opening windows of opportunity for innovation and transformation. While the nature and extent of this crisis is rare, extreme climatic events will increase in magnitude and frequency, threatening similar societal impacts. It is therefore critical to identify mechanisms for developing food systems that are resilient to such impacts. We examine impacts of the crisis on UK food systems and how these further entrenched social inequalities. We present data on the experiences and actions of producers, consumers, and community organisers. The data were collected by adapting ongoing research to include surveys, interviews and online workshops focused on the pandemic. Actors' responses to the pandemic foreshadow how enduring change to food systems can be achieved.

"[COVID-19 - BLOOD GROUPS, ANTIBODIES AND CONVALESCENT PLASMA].","Izak, Marina; Yahalom, Vered; Maor, Yasmin; Zimhoni, Oren; Cohen, Daniel; Chen, Jacob; Shinar, Eilat","INTRODUCTION: Israel is currently struggling with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2. Transmission is increasing, with higher morbidity and mortality among populations at risk. Over-representation of blood type A was reported in COVID-19 patients with increased respiratory failure, while blood type O seems to have a protective effect. This may be caused by interference of anti-A antibodies in viral binding to the ACE receptor, different neutralization antibodies potency or variations in the stability of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in different blood types. Since transfusion of convalescent COVID19 Plasma (CCP) is an accepted therapeutic modality, the Ministry of Health initiated a national project whereby CCP is collected by Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Services using apheresis procedures and transfusions are approved by an experts committee, as part of the clinical trial or as compassionate treatment. Preliminary analysis of 49/170 patients treated so far shows improvement in 49%, with important relations with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies level in the transfused plasma. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of 1100 CCP donors, but a 13% decrease in antibodies level was detected in repeat donations. Blood type A was more predominant among CCP donors, when compared to MDA blood donors' data. A transfusion of CCP is a feasible and relatively safe therapeutic modality, mainly for patients with moderate COVID 19. CCP also serves as a source for the production of hyperimmune globulin for the treatment of COVID 19 and for passive immunization for populations at risk.",2021,/,Harefuah,160,3,139-143,,,33749174,#90877,Izak 2021,"",""
Vitamin D supplementation as an important factor in COVID-19 prevention and treatment: what evidence do we have?.,"Smaha, Juraj; Kuzma, Martin; Jackuliak, Peter; Payer, Juraj","The immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D and its potential in prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections have long been of interest to many scientific teams around the world. Several meta-analyses in the last 10 years have confirmed the protective (albeit of modest size) effect of vitamin D against respiratory infections. Because of many overlapping risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and severe COVID-19 infection, many experts believe that vitamin D supplementation could play an important role in prevention and treatment of the new coronavirus disease. Based on available data on the immunological action of vitamin D, it is possible that vitamin D could modulate the bodys response to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in the early viraemic phase and in later hyperinflammatory phase typical for the severe course of the disease. The first available data from epidemiological studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with increased susceptibility to the new coronavirus infection as well as with severe course of the disease.",2020,/,Vnitrni lekarstvi,66,8,494-500,,,33740849,#90876,Smaha 2020,"",""

We aimed to clarify the characteristics of radiological and functional lung sequelae of COVID-19 patients described in follow-up period., METHOD: PubMed and EMBASE were searched on January 20th, 2021 to investigate characteristics of lung sequelae in COVID-19 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were collected and analyzed using one-group meta-analysis., RESULTS: Our search identified 15 eligible studies with follow-up period in a range of 1-6 months. A total of 3066 discharged patients were included in these studies. Among them, 1232 and 1359 patients were evaluated by chest CT and PFT, respectively. The approximate follow-up timing on average was 90 days after either symptom onset or hospital discharge. The frequency of residual CT abnormalities after hospital discharge was 55.7% (95% confidential interval (CI) 41.2-70.1, I2 = 96.2%). The most frequent chest CT abnormality was ground glass opacity in 44.1% (95% CI 30.5-57.8, I2 = 96.2%), followed by parenchymal band or fibrous stripe in 33.9% (95% CI 18.4-49.4, I2 = 95.0%).

To enable clinicians to appropriately profile and treat suspected COVID-19 patients at the emergency department (ED), externally validated models that predict poor outcome are desperately needed., OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to identify predictors of poor outcome, defined as mortality or ICU admission within 30 days, in patients presenting to the ED with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19, and to develop and externally validate a prediction model for poor outcome., METHODS: In this prospective, multi-center study, we enrolled suspected COVID-19 patients presenting at the EDs of two hospitals in the Netherlands. We used backward logistic regression to develop a prediction model. We used the area under the curve (AUC), Brier score and pseudo-R2 to assess model performance. The model was externally validated in an Italian cohort., RESULTS: We included 1193 patients between March 12 and May 27 2020, of whom 196 (16.4%) had a poor outcome.

Rapid point-of-care testing for COVID-19: quality of supportive information for lateral flow serology assays.,"Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Buckle, Peter","OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of evidence addressing several important human factors questions pertaining to the quality of supportive information provided by commercial manufacturers that can affect the adoption and use of lateral flow serology assays in practice. We aimed to: (1) identify and assess the quality of information that commercial manufacturers provided for their point-of-care tests (POCTs) and (2) examine the implications of these findings on real-world settings., DESIGN: We used a content analysis methodology in two stages to systematically, code and analyse textual data from documents of commercial manufacturers. A deductive approach was applied using a coding guide based on the validated Point-of-Care Key Evidence Tool (POCKET) multidimensional checklist. An inductive approach was used to identify new patterns or themes generated from our textual analysis., SETTING: Publicly available supportive information documents by commercial manufacturers for lateral flow serology, were identified and gathered from online searches., PARTICIPANTS: Supportive information documents retrieved from online searches over 3 months (March 2020 to June 2020)., RESULTS: A total of 79 POCTs were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. Using the POCKET coding guide, we found that the quality of information varied significantly between the manufacturers and was often lacking in detail. Our inductive approach further examined these topics and found that several statements were vague and that significant variations in the level of details existed between manufacturers., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant concerns surrounding the supportive information reported by manufacturers for lateral flow serology assays. Information transparency was poor and human factor issues were not properly addressed to mitigate the risk of improper device use, although it should be noted that the results of our study are limited by the data that manufactures were prepared to disclose. Overall, commercial manufacturers should improve the quality and value of information presented in their supporting documentation. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

We aimed to understand migrant worker concerns and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to address these during the crisis and inform on comprehensive support needed after the crisis., METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19. The participants were recruited from a COVID-19 mass quarantine facility in Singapore through a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis performed to derive themes in their collective experience during the crisis., RESULTS: Three theme categories were derived from 27 interviews: migrant worker concerns during COVID-19, coping during COVID-19 and priorities after COVID-19. Major stressors in the crisis included the inability to continue providing for their families when work is disrupted, their susceptibility to infection in crowded dormitories, the shock of receiving the COVID-19 diagnosis while asymptomatic, as well as the isolating conditions of the quarantine environment. The workers coped by keeping in contact with their families, accessing healthcare, keeping updated with the news and continuing to practise their faith and religion. They looked forward to a return to normalcy after the crisis with keeping healthy and having access to healthcare as new priorities., CONCLUSION: We identified coping strategies employed by the workers in quarantine, many of which were made possible through the considered design of care and service delivery in mass quarantine facilities in Singapore. These can be adopted in the set-up of other mass quarantine facilities around the world to support the health and mental well-being of those quarantined. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted policy intervention for migrant workers, in areas such as housing and working environments, equitable access to healthcare, and social protection during and after this crisis.

Participants learned about the study by being identified on medical center-based registries and being notified or by responding to advertisements. At 4-month intervals, we asked participants about physical symptoms that were new or worse compared to the period prior to COVID-19, mental health symptoms and quality of life. We described 4 time periods: 1) acute illness (0-3 weeks), 2) early recovery (3-10 weeks), 3) late recovery 1 (12-20 weeks), and 4) late recovery 2 (28-36 weeks). Blood and oral specimens were collected at each visit., RESULTS: We have, to date, enrolled 179 adults. During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 had been asymptomatic, 125 symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 44 symptomatic and hospitalized. In the acute phase, the most common symptoms were fatigue, fever, myalgia, cough and anosmia/dysgeusia. During the post-acute phase, fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration problems, headaches, trouble sleeping and anosmia/dysgeusia were the most commonly reported symptoms, but a variety of others were endorsed by at least some participants. Some experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, as well as difficulties with ambulation and performance of usual activities.

In this paper, we consider the task of forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level for the United States. Although multiple methods have been explored for this task, their performance has varied across space and time due to noisy data and the inherent dynamic nature of the pandemic. We present a forecasting pipeline which incorporates probabilistic forecasts from multiple statistical, machine learning and mechanistic methods through a Bayesian ensembling scheme, and has been operational for nearly 6 months serving local, state and federal policymakers in the United States. While showing that the Bayesian ensemble is at least as good as the individual methods, we also show that each individual method contributes significantly for different spatial regions and time points. We compare our model's performance with other similar models being integrated into CDC-initiated COVID-19 Forecast Hub, and show better performance at longer forecast horizons. Finally, we also describe how such forecasts are used to increase lead time for training mechanistic scenario projections.

Although severe COVID-19 disease is linked to exuberant inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not understood. Monocytes are sentinel blood cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and processing and release of IL-1 family cytokines, potent inflammatory mediators. Here we show that ~10% of blood monocytes in COVID-19 patients are dying and infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Social attitudes and activities associated with loneliness: Findings from a New Zealand national survey of the adult population.,"Lay-Yee, Roy; Campbell, David; Milne, Barry","There has been growing recognition of the harmful consequences of loneliness for health and well-being, and the need for community intervention, particularly in times of global crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic with its imperatives of distancing, isolation, and quarantine. Social capital and a sense of social cohesion are known to have roles in buffering against the effects of adverse life circumstances. Our study sought to investigate the association of a range of social attitudes and activities - as proxies for social capital - with loneliness while taking into account socio-demographic factors. We undertook a national survey on a stratified random sample of the New Zealand (NZ) adult population aged 18+ in 2017 (n = 1,358), data from which included the requisite variables. The prevalence of loneliness was highest in young adults (18-30), falling with age until a slight rise in older people (76+). Loneliness was associated with socio-demographic factors, being more prevalent in the more disadvantaged groups: the deprived, Maori (the indigenous people of NZ), the non-partnered, and the less educated. Controlling for these socio-demographic factors, pro-social attitudes (that is towards political efficacy, trust in others, not feeling exploited, or being committed to family) and participation in social activities (that is being employed or being involved in recreation groups) - were protective against loneliness. Our study supports asset-based approaches to tackling loneliness - with implications for health and social care - that emphasise mobilising existing social resources, building social capital, and raising social cohesion in our communities. Such intervention on loneliness would help to prevent and ameliorate its detrimental consequences for public health.

Challenges of SERS technology as a non-nucleic acid or -antigen detection method for SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.,"Sitjar, Jaya; Liao, Jiunn-Der; Lee, Han; Tsai, Huey-Pin; Wang, Jen-Ren; Liu, Ping-Yen","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant burden since December 2019 that has negatively impacted the global economy owing to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is fast-transmitting and highly contagious. Efforts have been taken to minimize the impact through strict screening measures in country borders in order to isolate potential virus carriers. Effective fast-screening methods are thus needed to identify infected individuals. The standard diagnostic methods for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus have always been to perform nucleic acid-based and serological tests. However, with each having drawbacks on producing false results at very early or later stage after symptoms onset, supplementary techniques are needed to back up these tests. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a detection technique has continuously advanced throughout the years in terms of sensitivity and capability to detect ultralow concentration of analytes ranging from single molecule to pathogens, to present as a highly potential alternative to known sensing methods. SERS technology as a candidate for an alternative and supplementary diagnostic method for the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 virus is presented, comparing its pros and cons to the standard methods and what other aspects it could offer that the other methods are not capable of. Factors that contribute to the detection effectivity of SERS is also discussed to show the advantages and limitations of this technique. Despite its promising capabilities, challenges like sources of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations, reliable SERS spectra, mass production of SERS-active substrates, and compliance to regulations for wide-scale testing scenario are highlighted.

Early and accurate diagnosis and quarantine remain the most effective mitigation strategy. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, recent studies suggest that nucleic acids were undetectable in a significant number of cases with clinical features of COVID-19. Serologic assays that detect human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 serve as a complementary method to diagnose these cases, as well as to identify asymptomatic cases and qualified convalescent serum donors. However, commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are laborious and non-quantitative, while point-of-care assays suffer from low detection accuracy. To provide a serologic assay with high performance and portability for potential point-of-care applications, we developed DNA-assisted nanopore sensing for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 related antibodies in human serum. Different DNA structures were used as detection reporters for multiplex quantification of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens from patients with conformed or suspected infection.

The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated., METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety., RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants.

After performing multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that age, WBC, platelet, procalcitonin, and AST provide identical markers for distinguishing COVID-19 from KD in children. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> In this COVID-19 pandemic period, clinicians should pay attention to children with COVID-19 infection when high WBC, platelet, procalcitonin, and AST values are present in order to provide precision treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for KD or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).",2021,,,,,,PPR301643,10.21203/rs.3.rs-266709/v1,,#93008,Liu 2021,"",""

While the vast majority of PJP cases occur within the first 6 months after transplantation, very few PJP cases are seen beyond 1 year post transplantation (late-onset PJP). PJP and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2) share quite a few common clinical manifestations and imaging findings, making the diagnosis of PJP often underappreciated during the current COVID-19 pandemic. To date, only 1 case of kidney transplantation who developed COVID-19 and late-onset PJP has been reported, but this patient also suffered from many other infections and died from respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. A successful treatment of kidney patients with COVID-19 and late-onset PJP has not been reported. Case presentation: We present a case of a 55-year-old male kidney transplant patient with COVID-19 who also developed late-onset PJP. He received a combined strategy, including specific anti-pneumocystis therapy, symptomatic supportive therapy, adjusted immunosuppressive therapy, and use of antiviral/antibiotics drugs, ending with a favorable outcome. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> This case highlights the importance of prompt and differential diagnosis of PJP in kidney transplant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to clarify if kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 could be prone to develop late-onset PJP and how these patients should be treated.",2021,,,,,,PPR301519,10.21203/rs.3.rs-346277/v1,,#93006,Peng 2021,"",""

Determining the fundamental biology of viral variants and understanding their evolutionary trajectories will guide current mitigation measures, future genetic surveillance and vaccination strategies. Here we examine virus entry by the B.1.1.7 lineage, commonly referred to as the UK/Kent variant. Pseudovirus infection of model cell lines demonstrate that B.1.1.7 entry is enhanced relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, particularly under low expression of receptor ACE2. Moreover, the entry characteristics of B.1.1.7 were distinct from that of its predecessor strain containing the D614G mutation. These data suggest evolutionary tuning of spike protein function. Additionally, we found that amino acid deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike were important for efficient entry by B.1.1.7. The NTD is a hotspot of diversity across sarbecoviruses, therefore, we further investigated this region by examining the entry of closely related CoVs. Surprisingly, Pangolin CoV spike entry was 50-100 fold enhanced relative to SARS-CoV-2; suggesting there may be evolutionary pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 may further optimise entry. Swapping the NTD between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that changes in this region alone have the capacity to enhance virus entry. Thus, the NTD plays a hitherto unrecognised role in modulating spike activity, warranting further investigation and surveillance of NTD mutations.",2021,,,,,,PPR301859,10.1101/2021.03.22.436468,,#93015,Dicken 2021,"",""
Detection of Mutations Associated with Variants of Concern Via High Throughput Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from NYC Wastewater,"Smyth, Davida; Trujillo, Monica; Cheung, Kristen; Gao, Anna; Hoxie, Irene; Kannoly, Sherin; Kubota, Nanami; Markman, Michelle; San, Kaung Myat; Sompanya, Geena; Dennehy, John","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples. <h4>IMPORTANCE</h4> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused millions of deaths around the world as countries struggle to contain infections. The pandemic will not end until herd immunity is reached, that is, when most of the population has either recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern threatens to erase gains. Emerging new variants may re-infect persons who have recovered from COVID-19 or may evade vaccine-induced immunity. However, scaling up SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing to monitor Variants of Concern in communities around the world is challenging. Wastewater-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be used to monitor the presence of emerging variants in large communities to enact control measures to minimize the spread of these variants. We describe here the identification of alleles associated with several variants of concern in wastewater obtained from NYC watersheds.",2021,,,,,,PPR301817,10.1101/2021.03.21.21253978,,#93013,Smyth 2021,"",""

The BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine has been shown to induce strong immune responses among the vaccinated population. Measuring SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG levels is a clinically convenient way to estimate post-vaccination humoral immune responses, but only limited data exists about its short-and long-term dynamics. We present a longitudinal analysis of post-vaccination IgG levels in a cohort of 122 healthcare workers vaccinated with BNT162b2 with weekly follow-up until 35 days past the first dose and results of the first monthly follow-up after that for a subset of these. <h4>Methods</h4> This prospective, multicenter cohort study consists of two periods for short-term and long-term evaluation of post-vaccination IgG levels. Tests were carried out on 666 samples from 122 participants, using in-house anti-spike 1 and anti-nucleocapsid IgG ELISA assays and a commercial, combined version of these. <h4>Findings</h4> Participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection mount a quick immune response, reaching peak IgG levels two weeks after vaccination. In contrast, the corresponding IgG levels for previously uninfected participants increase gradually, changing abruptly after the booster dose. Overall higher IgG levels are maintained for the previously infected group 35-70 days after vaccination, and we observe age-dependence of immune response as well. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Our results show a robust humoral immune response mounting gradually after the first vaccine dose for the uninfected group, and a much stronger immune response within 7-14 days after the first dose for the previously infected group.",2021,,,,,,PPR302343,10.1101/2021.03.17.21253751,,#93027,Korodi 2021,"",""

Total antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike protein receptor binding domain (S/RBD) were assessed using commercial immunoassays. We quantified IgG and IgM responses to S/RBD and determined the ability of antibodies to block S/RBD binding to ACE2 receptor using ELISA.

The development of a universal human coronavirus vaccine could prevent future pandemics. We characterized 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID19+ subjects and identified 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targeted the NTD, one recognized an epitope in S2 and twelve bound the RBD. Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency rather than the antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The anti-S2 antibody also neutralized SARS-CoV-1 and all four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralized the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.",2021,,,,,,PPR302330,10.1101/2021.03.23.436684,,#93023,Jennewein 2021,"",""
Human CD4+ T cells specific for dominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins with therapeutic potential,"Verhagen, Johan; Meijden, Edith Van der; Lang, Vanessa; Kremer, Andreas; Völkl, Simon; Mackensen, Andreas; Aigner, Michael; Kremer, Anita","Since December 2019, Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world, leading to a global effort to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite extensive progress, there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID-19 is mediated by both short-lived neutralising antibodies and long-lasting virus-reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells from COVID-19 patients with a potentially protective response to two major antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike and Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly virus-reactive CD4+ T cells, we were able to confirm a set of 9 immunodominant epitopes and characterise T cell responses against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their cytokine response was examined. Moreover, by using an advanced T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the paired TCR sequences of clones of interest. While these data on a limited population require further expansion for universal application, the results presented here form a crucial first step towards TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cell therapy of COVID-19.",2021,,,,,,PPR302238,10.22541/au.161654362.26820666/v1,,#93021,Verhagen 2021,"",""
The Impact of Vaccination to Control COVID-19 Burden in the United States: A Simulation Modeling Approach,"Alagoz, Oguzhan; Sethi, Ajay; Patterson, Brian; Churpek, Matthew; Alhanaee, Ghalib; Scaria, Elizabeth; Safdar, Nasia","<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Introduction</h4> Vaccination programs aim to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relative impacts of vaccine coverage, effectiveness, and capacity in the context of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask use and physical distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are unclear. Our objective was to examine the impact of vaccination on the control of SARS-CoV-2 using our previously developed agent-based simulation model. <h4>Methods</h4> We applied our agent-based model to replicate COVID-19-related events in 1) Dane County, Wisconsin; 2) Milwaukee metropolitan area, Wisconsin; 3) New York City (NYC). We evaluated the impact of vaccination considering the proportion of the population vaccinated, probability that a vaccinated individual gains immunity, vaccination capacity, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. The primary outcomes were the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the timing of pandemic control, defined as the date after which only a small number of new cases occur. We also estimated the number of cases without vaccination. <h4>Results</h4> The timing of pandemic control depends highly on vaccination coverage, effectiveness, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. In Dane County and Milwaukee, if 50% of the population is vaccinated with a daily vaccination capacity of 0.1% of the population, vaccine effectiveness of 90%, and the adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions is 85%, controlled spread could be achieved by July 2021 and August 2021, respectively versus in March 2022 in both regions without vaccine. If adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions increases to 70%, controlled spread could be achieved by May 2021 and April 2021 in Dane County and Milwaukee, respectively. <h4>Discussion</h4> In controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of vaccination varies widely depending not only on effectiveness and coverage, but also concurrent adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants was not considered. <h4>Primary Funding Source</h4> National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases",2021,,,,,,PPR302425,10.1101/2021.03.22.21254131,,#93037,Alagoz 2021,"",""

Here we present a mathematical framework for variant emergence accounting for the highly variable number of people secondarily infected by individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our simulations suggest that threatening new variants probably develop within infected people fairly commonly, but that most die out and do not achieve permanence in the population.

"Characterising long COVID more than 6 months after acute infection in adults; prospective longitudinal cohort study, England","Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Harris, Ross; Aiano, Felicity; Zavala, Maria; Bertran, Marta; Borrow, Ray; Linley, Ezra; Ahmad, Shazaad; Parker, Ben; Horsley, Alex; Hallis, Bassam; Flood, Jessica; Brown, Kevin; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Ramsay, Mary; Andrews, Nick; Ladhani, Shamez","<h4>Background</h4> Most individuals with COVID-19 will recover without sequelae, but some will develop long-term multi-system impairments. The definition, duration, prevalence and symptoms associated with long COVID, however, have not been established. <h4>Methods</h4> Public Health England (PHE) initiated longitudinal surveillance of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers for monthly assessment and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in March 2020. Eight months after enrolment, participants completed an online questionnaire including 72 symptoms in the preceding month. Symptomatic mild-to-moderate cases with confirmed COVID-19 were compared with asymptomatic, seronegative controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent symptoms associated with long COVID. <h4>Findings</h4> All 2,147 participants were contacted and 1,671 (77.8%) completed the questionnaire, including 140 (8.4%) cases and 1,160 controls. At a median of 7.5 (IQR 7.1-7.8) months after infection, 20 cases (14.3%) had ongoing (4/140, 2.9%) or episodic (16/140, 11.4%) symptoms. We identified three clusters of symptoms associated with long COVID, those affecting the sensory (ageusia, anosmia, loss of appetite and blurred vision), neurological (forgetfulness, short-term memory loss and confusion/brain fog) and cardiorespiratory (chest tightness/pain, unusual fatigue, breathlessness after minimal exertion/at rest, palpitations) systems. The sensory cluster had the highest association with being a case (aOR 5.25, 95% CI 3.45-8.01). Dermatological, gynaecological, gastrointestinal or mental health symptoms were not significantly different between cases and controls. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Most persistent symptoms reported following mild COVID-19 were equally common in cases and controls. While all three clusters identified had a strong association with cases, the sensory cluster had the highest specificity and strength of association, and therefore, most likely to be characteristic of long COVID. <h4>Funding</h4> PHE. <h4>Research in context</h4> <h4>Evidence before this study</h4> We searched PubMed using search terms “long covid*” OR “post COVID*” in adults for studies including cohort, case reports, randomised control trials, cross-sectional and systematic reviews published up to 12 March 2020 without any language restrictions. Most reports included a small number of cases. Larger studies included very specific cohorts, including hospitalised cases and self-selected participants with COVID-19. A systematic review identified 15 studies and, using a broad case definition, concluded that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%), but no assessment was made of these symptoms in uninfected adults. <h4>Added value of this study</h4> In a prospective, longitudinal cohort of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers recruited at the start of the pandemic, we found that most self-reported symptoms were as common in 140 adults who developed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 more than 6 months previously compared to 1,160 controls who were asymptomatic and SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative throughout the surveillance period. Compared to controls, we identified three clusters of symptoms affecting the sensory, neurological and cardiorespiratory systems that were more prevalent among cases. Notably, symptoms affecting other organ systems were as prevalent among cases as controls. The high proportion of cases and controls reporting mental health symptoms highlights the toll that the pandemic has had on healthcare workers <h4>Implications of all the available evidence</h4> Our findings highlight the importance of including a representative cohort of cases to assess long-term outcomes of COVID-19 as well as appropriate controls to estimate the relative prevalence of self-reported symptoms to accurately define this new syndrome. Our study adds to the evidence-base for long COVID in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who contribute to the vast majority of 120+ million infections worldwide. This information is not only important for clinicians, patients and the public, but also for policy makers and healthcare providers who are investing heavily in long-term provisions for COVID-19 survivors.",2021,,,,,,PPR302933,10.1101/2021.03.18.21253633,,#93060,Amin-Chowdhury 2021,"",""

This study aimed to analyze and compare AKIs in different stages of COVID-19. <h4>Methods: </h4> 1056 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were retrospectively evaluated and 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-nine patients who developed AKI, but didn’t have prior kidney diseases were involved in the final analysis. Patients were classified into three groups, those who had AKI on admission, those who developed AKI in the first week and those who developed AKI starting from the 7 th day. Electrolytes, acid-base status and changes in the inflammatory markers were compared. <h4>Results: </h4> AKIs that were seen on hospital admission day were generally transient. Patients who developed AKI after the 7 th day had higher peak CRP and D-dimer levels and lower nadir lymphocyte counts (p=0.000, 0.004 and 0.003 respectively). AKI that developed later was more related to immunologic response and had significantly higher mortality, reaching as high as 44% for those who developed AKI after 7 th day.

COVID-19: ORF8 Synthesizes Nitric Oxide to Break the Blood-Brain/Testi Barrier and Damage the Reproductive System,"wenzhong, liu; hualan, Li","Studies have reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can break through the blood-brain/testi barrier and invade the human reproductive system, causing infertility or complications in patients. Excessive nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental reason for breaking the Blood-Brain/Testi Barrier. Nitric oxide often relates the spread or replication of many viruses in the body. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that synthesizes NO in the human by binding heme to complete the oxygenase reaction. This study focused on the relationship between heme, NO, and the novel coronavirus using bioinformatics methods such as domain search and molecular docking. The results showed ORF8 had three domains similar to nitric oxide synthase : oxygenase, reductase, and calmodulin (CaM). ORF6 could bind to these three domains. The dimer of ORF8 was identical to the dimer of NOS enzyme. The oxygenase domain was in the core, and the reductase domain was on both sides. ORF8 could capture Heme, H4B, L-arginine, FAD, FMN, and NADPH, and bind with CaM protein to catalyze NO production. The heme bound by ORF8 mainly came from the attacked hemoglobin. ORF8 also attached to E protein and synthesized NO through the heme hunted by E protein. We believed NO synthesized by ORF8 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 from reinfecting infected cells and controlled the virus replication speed to avoid cell collapse because of exhaustion of resources. After the SARS-CoV-2 virus combined with an extensive ORF8, the produced NO stream permeably expanded blood vessels and broke the blood-brain/testi barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to nearby tissues through small blood vessel holes created by NO stream. It would increase the tendency to bleed and the blood clotting of the tissue: blood clotting and viral infections severely damaged organs such as the respiratory, heart, nerve, reproductive. Short NO could not open vascular permeability dilation, causing high viral load in asymptomatic patients' blood. Excessive NO stimulated the reproductive organs and generated abnormal functions. It also made abnormal hormone regulation, such as excessive secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). Much LH would hurt the reproductive organs, leading to infertility. Extreme NO also interfered with the human NO signaling pathway and damaged the immune nerve, metabolism, cardiovascular and other systems. This theory is for academic discussion only. We hope that this discovery will help block the virus’s transmission through the human circulatory system and help reproductive health management during the pandemic.",2021,,,,,,PPR302509,10.26434/chemrxiv.14268614.v1,,#93042,wenzhong 2021,"",""
How safe is Covishield (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) vaccine?

"Mental/Behavioral Health as a Predictor of Initial COVID-19 Diagnosis: Results from the Colorado All Payer Claims Data Set to June 30, 2020","Wilson, Thomas; Sullivan, Janet (Jessie)","Background: Mental health conditions have not been sufficiently considered as a pre-existing condition for COVID-19. To address this, an analysis was completed from the Colorado All Payer Claims Data through June 30, 2020, using a matched design to non-COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was based on individuals listed in the data set with an insurance claim with a date of service from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. (COVID-19 patients were identified based on a claim with a principal diagnosis of COVID-19 between March-June 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create the reference group based on the calendar month of each COVID-19 event date and a claim dated in the same month for the reference group. Additional criteria for matching included: age band (0-29 years, 30-64 years, 65+ years), sex, estimated number of months of insurance coverage and quartiles of health care expenditures based on the 12 months prior to the event date. Variables examined in prediction models for COVID-19 incidence included primary diagnosis of a mental/behavioral health (MBH) condition, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and chronic kidney disease in the 12 months prior to the event date and interaction terms between MBH and each of the five physical health conditions. Results: The study comprised n=7,599 in both the COVID-19 group and the reference. A prior mental/behavioral health diagnosis was an independent predictor among people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Mental/behavioral health conditions with especially high prevalence differences between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients included schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders and depressive disorders. Previously recognized risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and asthma were also confirmed as independent predictors of COVID-19 in this population. Most significantly, when a diagnosis of mental/behavioral health appeared in conjunction with one of these physical diseases, it acted as a multiplier for predicting COVID-19 (the multiplier effect ranges from 2.28 to 4.29 over individuals with only one of the major medical diseases previously linked to COVID-19 risk). Recommendation: Current immunization strategies and outreach should consider putting Individuals with prior mental/behavioral health history in high priority groups. As vaccine becomes more generally available consideration should be given monitoring vaccine compliance among the MBH population.&lt;br&gt;",2021,,,,,,PPR302792,10.2139/ssrn.3807198,,#93048,Wilson 2021,"",""

We identify, for the first time, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains in plasma samples of three Haitian children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Genomic and evolutionary analyses reveal that human infections were the result of at least two independent zoonoses of distinct viral lineages that acquired the same mutational signature in the nsp15 and the spike glycoprotein genes by convergent evolution. In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the Spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect protein’s flexibility and binding to the host cell receptor.

The vaccine-elicited immunoglobulin profile in milk after COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccination is IgG-dominant and lacks secretory antibodies,"Fox, Alisa; Norris, Caroline; Amanat, Fatima; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Powell, Rebecca","The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are licensed under emergency use authorization, with millions of doses already administered globally [1]. No COVID-19 vaccines are yet under investigation for use in infants or young children. As such, the passive immunity of the antibodies (Abs) provided through milk from a vaccinated person may be one of the only ways to protect this population until pediatric COVID-19 vaccines are licensed. Our early work (as well as an expanded study being published concurrently with this report) examining the milk Ab response after SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that Spike-specific IgA in milk after infection is dominant and highly correlated with a secretory Ab response [2]. Determining if secretory Abs are elicited in milk is critical, as this Ab class is highly stable and resistant to enzymatic degradation in all mucosae - not only in the infant oral/nasal cavity and gut, but in the airways and GI tract as well [3, 4]. Presently, we describe our analysis of the milk Ab response 14 days after completion of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine regimen among 10 individuals. It was evident that unlike the post-infection milk Ab profile, IgG dominates after COVID-19 vaccination. One hundred percent of post-vaccine milk contained significant levels of Spike-specific IgG, with 8/10 samples exhibiting high IgG endpoint titers. Conversely, 6/10 (60%) of post-vaccine samples were positive for Spike specific IgA, with only 1 (10%) exhibiting high IgA endpoint titer. Furthermore, 5/10 (50%) post-vaccine milk samples contained Spike-specific secretory Ab, none of which were found to be high-titer. As our analyses of the immune response in milk to COVID-19 vaccination continues, it will provide a critical opportunity to address huge knowledge gaps, inform the field as to which COVID-19 vaccine, if any, is likely to provide the best milk Ab response, and highlight the need to design improved vaccines with protection of the breastfeeding infant in mind.",2021,,,,,,PPR303303,10.1101/2021.03.22.21253831,,#93095,Fox 2021,"",""

Field deployable non-invasive sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed to evaluate the infectivity dynamics of the coronavirus in pediatric populations and guide public health interventions. We evaluated the utility of high-throughput Luminex-based assays applied to saliva samples to quantify IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against five SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in the context of a contacts and infectivity longitudinal study. We compared the antibody levels obtained in saliva versus serum/plasma samples from a group of children and adults tested weekly by RT-PCR over 35 days and diagnosed as positive (n=58), and a group of children and adults who consistently tested negative over the follow up period (n=61), in the Summer of 2020 in Barcelona, Spain. Antibody levels in saliva samples from individuals with confirmed RT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly higher than in negative individuals and correlated with those measured in sera/plasmas. Higher levels of anti-S IgG were found in asymptomatic individuals that could indicate protection against disease in infected individuals. Higher anti-S IgG and IgM levels in serum/plasma and saliva, respectively, in infected children compared to infected adults could also be related to stronger clinical immunity in them. Among infected children, males had higher levels of saliva IgG to N and RBD than females. Despite overall correlation, individual clustering analysis suggested that responses that may not be detected in blood could be patent in saliva, and vice versa, and therefore that both measurements are complementary. In addition to serum/plasma, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific saliva antibodies should be considered as a complementary non-invasive assay to better estimate the percentage of individuals who have experienced coronavirus infection.

Result(s): The MPV values were determined to be statistically significantly high (P <.001) and the lymphocyte values were significantly low (p:0.002) in the asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 compared with the healthy control children. No difference was determined between the groups in respect of CRP level, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts (P >.05). The optimal cutoff point for MPV was determined as 8.74 fl (Area under the curve-AUC:0.932) with 81.82% sensitivity and 95% specificity for the determination of children infected with COVID-19. A cutoff value of <2.12/mm3 for lymphocytes (AUC:0.670) was determined with 49.09% sensitivity and 86.67% specificity for the prediction of COVID-19. Based on the ROC analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of MPV were determined to be higher than that of lymphocyte levels. Conclusion(s): The results of this study indicate that MPV levels are significantly high in asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 demonstrate that this is an important predictive value and has better predictive capacity than lymphocyte values. The evaluation of MPV and lymphocyte levels together could increase diagnostic success in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2021,/,International Journal of Clinical Practice,75,4,e13892,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13892,2007626992,#91801,Gumus 2021,"",""
Association between different screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths and severe disease in Italy,Mannucci E.; Silverii A.; Monami M. ,"Background: The WHO recommends testing any suspected person with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in order to limit the spread of the epidemic. In Italy, some Regions opted for extensive testing, whereas others limited tests to selected subjects. To assess the influence of different strategies, we examined the incidence of death and severe cases in Italy. Method(s): Data on new cases of SARS-CoV-2, number of tests, deaths and admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICU) were retrieved in each Italian Region, from 24 February to 18 March 2020. As an index of different screening strategies, the number of tests/positive test results (P/T) ratio as of 7 March 2020, was considered. The cumulative number of deaths and of new severe cases, between March 23 and 25 was recorded. The association of those two outcomes with the number of P/T ratio was assessed using linear regression models. Result(s): In the interval between March 23 and 25, recorded deaths (*million inhabitants) were 14 (3-54), whereas severe cases were 31 (10-112). Both the number of deaths and that of severe cases showed a significant correlation (R2.57 and.41, with P <.01) with the P/T ratio. Deaths and severe cases were associated with higher mean personal income and lower density of General Practioners (GPs). The association of P/T with severe cases and deaths retained statistical significance after adjusting for mean personal income (R2.30 and.41, respectively; both P =.04) and GPs density (R2.21 and.19, respectively; both P =.03).

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,Cagno V.; Magliocco G.; Tapparel C.; Daali Y. ,"Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019, no vaccine has been approved to counter this infection and the available treatments are mainly directed against the immune pathology caused by the infection. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic, pointing the urgent need for effective treatment. In such emergency, drug repurposing presents the best option for a rapid antiviral response. We assess here the in vitro activity of nilotinib, imatinib and dasatinib, three Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, against SARS-CoV-2. Although the last two compounds do not show antiviral efficacy, we observe inhibition with nilotinib in Vero-E6 cells and Calu-3 cells with EC50s of 1.44 muM and 3.06 muM, respectively. These values are close to the mean peak concentration of nilotinib observed at steady state in serum, making this compound a potential candidate for treatment of COVID-19 in vivo.Copyright © 2020 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)",2021,/,Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology,128,4,621-624,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13537,2007508524,#91798,Cagno 2021,"",""
Rates of bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial use in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study in light of antibiotic stewardship,Rothe K.; Feihl S.; Schneider J.; Wallnofer F.; Wurst M.; Lukas M.; Treiber M.; Lahmer T.; Heim M.; Dommasch M.; Waschulzik B.; Zink A.; Querbach C.; Busch D.H.; Schmid R.M.; Schneider G.; Spinner C.D. ,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. Bacterial co-infections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in respiratory viral infections; however, microbiological and antibiotic data related to COVID-19 are sparse. Adequate use of antibiotics in line with antibiotic stewardship (ABS) principles is warranted during the pandemic. We performed a retrospective study of clinical and microbiological characteristics of 140 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 to a German University hospital, with a focus on bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial therapy. The final date of follow-up was 6 May 2020. Clinical data of 140 COVID-19 patients were recorded: The median age was 63.5 (range 17-99) years; 64% were males. According to the implemented local ABS guidelines, the most commonly used antibiotic regimen was ampicillin/sulbactam (41.5%) with a median duration of 6 (range 1-13) days. Urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus peumoniae were negative in all cases. In critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (n = 50), co-infections with Enterobacterales (34.0%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (18.0%) were detected. Blood cultures collected at admission showed a diagnostic yield of 4.2%. Bacterial and fungal co-infections are rare in COVID-19 patients and are mainly prevalent in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial therapy on therapeutic outcome in COVID-19 patients to prevent antimicrobial overuse.

Drug screening and development from the affinity of S protein of new coronavirus with ACE2,Jiang Y.-P.; Zhao X.-X.; Lv H.-Q.; Wen C.-P. ,"Recently, various studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the ""doorknob"" that can be bound by the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which conduces to its entrance to the host cells, and plays an important role in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper aims to collect and sorts out the existing drugs, which exert the ability to block the binding of S protein and ACE2 so as to provide directions for the later drug development. By reviewing the existing literature, we expound the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of S protein and ACE2 binding, and summarize the drugs and compounds that can interfere with the interaction of spike protein and ACE2 receptor from different ways. We summarized five kinds of substances, including peptide P6, griffithsin, hr2p analogs, EK1, vaccine, monoclonal antibody, cholesterol-depleting agents, and extracts from traditional Chinese medicine. They can fight SARS-CoV-2 by specifically binding to ACE2 receptor, S protein, or blocking membrane fusion between the host and virus. ACE2 is the key point for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells, and it is also the focus of drug intervention.

Our objective was to describe the prevalence of hyposmia and hypogeusia and compare it in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to evaluate an association of these symptoms with disease severity. We performed a cross-sectional survey during 5 consecutive days in March 2020, within a tertiary referral center, associated outpatient clinic, and two primary care outpatient facilities in Paris. All SARS-CoV-2-positive patients hospitalized during the study period and able to be interviewed (n = 198), hospital outpatients seen during the previous month (n = 129), and all COVID-19-highly suspect patients in two primary health centers (n = 63) were included. Hospitalized patients were significantly more often male (64 vs 40%) and older (66 vs 43 years old in median) and had significantly more comorbidities than outpatients. Hyposmia and hypogeusia were reported by 33% of patients and occurred significantly less frequently in hospitalized patients (12% and 13%, respectively) than in the health centers' outpatients (33% and 43%, respectively) and in the hospital outpatients (65% and 60%, respectively). Hyposmia and hypogeusia appeared more frequently after other COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with hyposmia and/or hypogeusia were significantly younger and had significantly less respiratory severity criteria than patients without these symptoms. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction occurs frequently in COVID-19, especially in young, non-severe patients.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, and those being distributed currently, have been designed to induce neutralizing antibodies using the spike protein of the virus as an immunogen. However, the immunological correlates of protection against the virus remain unknown. This raises questions about the efficacy of current vaccination strategies. In addition, safety profiles of several vaccines seem inadequate or have not yet been evaluated under controlled experimentation. Here, evidence from the literature regarding the efforts already made to identify the immunological correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized.

Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin from convalescent plasma,Vandeberg P.; Cruz M.; Diez J.M.; Merritt W.K.; Santos B.; Trukawinski S.; Wellhouse A.; Jose M.; Willis T. ,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in China and quickly spread into a world-wide pandemic. Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULT(S): Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified IgG product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized ELISA activity (per mg/mL IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B and anti-D antibodies) were reduced to minimal levels. CONCLUSION(S): Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG) that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

Expanding frontiers of risk management: care safety in nursing home during COVID-19 pandemic,Scopetti M.; Santurro A.; Tartaglia R.; Frati P.; Fineschi V. ,"BACKGROUND: Nursing homes provide long-term care and have residential-oriented hospitalizations characterized by medical, nursing and social-care treatments for a typically geriatric population. In the current emergency phase, the problem of infections in residential structures for the elderly is taking on considerable importance in relation to the significant prevalence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SAFETY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES: Prevention and control measures for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in nursing homes should be planned before a possible outbreak of COVID-19 occurs and should be intensified during any exacerbation of the same. Each facility should identify a properly trained contact person-also external-for the prevention and control of infections, who can refer to a multidisciplinary support committee and who is in close contact with the local health authorities. The contact person should collaborate with professionals in order to prepare a prevention and intervention plan that considers national provisions and scientific evidence, the requirements for reporting patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and the indications for the management of suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Adequate risk management in residential structures implies the establishment of a coordination committee with dedicated staff, the implementation of a surveillance program for the rapid recognition of the outbreaks, the identification of suitable premises and equipment, the application of universal precautions, the adaptation of care plans to reduce the possibility of contagion among residents and the protection of operators and staff training initiatives.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted at 2 tertiary academic medical centers in Boston and New York. Eligible participants were hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and disease-related outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULT(S): The final analysis included 144 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (median age, 66 years; 64 [44.4%] male). Overall mortality was 18%, whereas patients with 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL (to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496) and higher had lower rates of mortality compared with those with 25(OH)D levels below 30 ng/mL (9.2% vs 25.3%; P=.02). In the adjusted multivariable analyses, 25(OH)D as a continuous variable was independently significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.98; P=.007) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.99; P=.01). Similar data were obtained when 25(OH)D was studied as a continuous variable after logarithm transformation and as a dichotomous (<30 ng/mL vs >=30 ng/mL) or ordinal variable (quintiles) in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSION(S): Among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with in-hospital mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

New dimensions for hospital services and early detection of disease: a Review from the Lancet Commission into liver disease in the UK,Williams R.; Alessi C.; Alexander G.; Allison M.; Aspinall R.; Batterham R.L.; Bhala N.; Day N.; Dhawan A.; Drummond C.; Ferguson J.; Foster G.; Gilmore I.; Goldacre R.; Gordon H.; Henn C.; Kelly D.; MacGilchrist A.; McCorry R.; McDougall N.; Mirza Z.; Moriarty K.; Newsome P.; Pinder R.; Roberts S.; Rutter H.; Ryder S.; Samyn M.; Severi K.; Sheron N.; Thorburn D.; Verne J.; Williams J.; Yeoman A. ,"This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Zoonotic tuberculosis - The changing landscape,Kock R.; Michel A.L.; Yeboah-Manu D.; Azhar E.I.; Torrelles J.B.; Cadmus S.I.; Brunton L.; Chakaya J.M.; Marais B.; Mboera L.; Rahim Z.; Haider N.; Zumla A. ,"Despite slow reductions in the annual burden of active human tuberculosis (TB) cases, zoonotic TB (zTB) remains a poorly monitored and an important unaddressed global problem. There is a higher incidence in some regions and countries, especially where close association exists between growing numbers of cattle (the major source of Mycobacterium bovis) and people, many suffering from poverty, and where dairy products are consumed unpasteurised. More attention needs to be focused on possible increased zTB incidence resulting from growth in dairy production globally and increased demand in low income countries in particular (Ohlan, 2014). Evidence of new zoonotic mycobacterial strains in South Asia and Africa (e.g. M. orygis), warrants urgent assessment of prevalence, potential drivers and risk in order to develop appropriate interventions. Control of M. bovis infection in cattle through detect and cull policies remain the mainstay of reducing zTB risk, whilst in certain circumstances animal vaccination is proving beneficial. New point of care diagnostics will help to detect animal infections and human cases.. Given the high burden of human tuberculosis (caused by M. tuberculosis) in endemic areas, animals are affected by reverse zoonosis, including multi-drug resistant strains. This, may create drug resistant reservoirs of infection in animals. Like COVID-19, zTB is evolving in an ever-changing global landscape.Copyright © 2021.

Development of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,Teresa Valenzuela M.; Urquidi C.; Rodriguez N.; Castillo L.; Fernandez J.; Ramirez E. ,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease are new global problems. The understanding of the host immune response in COVID-19 and its implications in the development of therapeutic agents are new challenges. Here, we evaluated the development of IgG and Nt antibodies in symptomatic hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We followed up 117 COVID-19 confirmed patients from a reference health center for COVID-19 during the epidemic in Santiago de Chile. One and two sequential blood samples from 117 and 68 cases were respectively obtained to evaluate the immune response. Immunofluorescence and neutralization assays in Vero E6 cells with a Chilean SARS-CoV-2 strain were performed. Out of the 68 patients, 44% were women and 56% men, and most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (47.7%) and diabetes (27.4%). The most frequent symptoms or signs related to COVID-19 were dyspnea, cough, fever, myalgia, and headache. In the all study population, 76.1% and 60.7% of patients were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the first blood sample. All patients except one were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the second sample. IgG and Nt antibodies positivity increased significantly according to the disease evolution periods. Higher Nt antibody titers were observed in the first sample in patients under 60 years of age. Obese and diabetic patients had no increase in Nt antibodies, unlike normal weight and diabetes-free patients. Both hypertensive and normotensive patients showed a significant increase in Nt antibodies. These results show an early and robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection during severe COVID-19.

The potential significance of high avidity IgG for protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2,Bauer G. ,"BACKGROUND: Avidity is defined as the strength of binding between IgG and its specific target epitope. IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. A failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in the lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as with seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination into the optimization of vaccination protocols and to try to achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Avidity determination also might be useful to control for truly protective immunity towards SARS-CoV-2 in individual cases.Copyright © 2021.

Stakeholder Perspectives on Engaging with Cerebral Palsy Research Studies Following Onset of COVID-19 in the United States,Joshi D.; Hill N.; Hruby A.; Viswanathan S.; Ingo C.; Roth H.; Sukal-Moulton T. ,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on perspectives towards participation in cerebral palsy (CP) research. DESIGN: An online survey with questions relating to the comfort levels of research participation was filled out by people who had CP or had a child with CP. SETTING: The online survey was administered through Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform. PARTICIPANTS: 233 individuals with CP (42.5%) or with a child with CP (57.1%) consented and at least partially completed the online survey (n=210 complete; n=23 partially complete). All participants resided in the United States. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Readiness to participate was analyzed in the context of the timepoint for research participation (TRP) during COVID-19 and whether or not the study offered direct benefits to participants. RESULT(S): Participants were consistently willing to participate sooner in studies that offered direct benefit than in those that did not. Adults responding for themselves had sooner timepoints for studies without direct benefit compared to parents answering for a child (p=0.030). GMFCS level, but not age or CP type, impacted the timepoint for studies without direct benefit (p=0.017). Personal values influenced selected timepoint for studies without direct benefit (p=0.007), while environmental factors impacted the timepoint for studies with direct benefit (p=0.002). Local COVID-19 incidence rates were not associated with timepoints for either research type, however respondents expected precautions to be taken if they chose to participate. CONCLUSION(S): As the pandemic evolves, researchers should consider the perspectives of potential participants as well as ethical and safety factors when re-initiating in-person CP research.Copyright © 2021.

Renal Injury by SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review,Wang M.; Xiong H.; Chen H.; Li Q.; Ruan X.Z. ,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause renal involvement, and severe renal dysfunction is more common among patients with chronic comorbid conditions, especially patients with chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to be the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in kidneys, suggesting that ACE2-related changes may be involved in renal injury during the infection. In this review, we systematically reviewed the literature to summarize findings on the mechanism of renal injury caused by SARS-COV-2 infection, in order to provide a theoretical basis for renal protection therapy. Summary: For patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, renal injury mainly manifests as increased serum creatinine, variable degrees of proteinuria and hematuria, and radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis of renal injury deriving from SARS-CoV-2 infection by focusing on its etiology, pathology, and clinical manifestations. The virus causes kidney injury by either direct infection or systemic effects, including host immune clearance and immune tolerance disorders, endothelium-mediated vasculitis, thrombus formation, glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, and hypoxia. Key Messages: Renal injury by SARS-CoV-2 is the result of multiple factors. Via highly expressed ACE2 in renal tissue, SARS-CoV-2 infection fundamentally initiates a mechanism of renal injury. Systemic effects such as host immune clearance and immune tolerance disorders, endothelial cell injury, thrombus formation, glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, and hypoxia aggravate this renal injury.Copyright © 2021 S.

Impact of covid-19 on the anxiety perceived by healthcare professionals: Differences between primary care and hospital care,Londono-Ramirez A.C.; Garcia-Pla S.; Bernabeu-Juan P.; Perez-Martinez E.; Rodriguez-Marin J.; Van-Der Hofstadt-Roman C.J. ,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an emotional impact on healthcare professionals at different levels of care, and it is important to understand the levels of anxiety of hospital personnel (HP) compared to those of primary care personnel (PCP). The objectives herein were to assess the differences in anxiety levels between these populations and to detect factors that may influence them. The anxiety levels (measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale) of the HP and PCP groups were compared using data collected from a cross-sectional study. The secondary variables included demographic and health data, confinement factors, contact with COVID-19 patients, having suffered from COVID-19, perceptions of protection, caregiver overload, threat, and satisfaction with management. We found anxiety ""case"" (35.6%) and ""at-risk"" (21%), with statistically significant differences in the group ""at risk"", and higher scores in the PCP group. The factors associated with the perception of threat and protection were significant determinants of an increase in anxiety, with all of them showing statistically significant differences. There were greater symptoms of anxiety in the PCP group than the HP group (32% vs. 18%). The factors associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms were the perceptions of threat, protection, management, caregiver overload, and perceived degree of threat associated with COVID-19.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Etransmission characteristics of sars-cov-2 that hinder effective control,Bae S.; Lim J.S.; Kim J.Y.; Jung J.; Kim S.-H. ,"The most important characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission that makes it difficult to control are 1) asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, 2) low incidence or lack of dominant systemic symptoms such as fever, 3) airborne transmission that may need a high infectious dose, and 4) super-spread events (SSEs). Patients with COVID-19 have high viral loads at symptom onset or even a few days prior to symptom onset, and most patients with COVID-19 have only mild respiratory symptoms or merely pauci-/null-symptoms. These characteristics of the virus enable it to easily spread to the community because most patients are unaware of their potential infectivity, and symptom-based control measures cannot prevent this type of transmission. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also capable of airborne transmission in conditions such as aerosol-generating procedures, under-ventilated indoor spaces, and over-crowded areas. In this context, universal mask-wearing is important to prevent both outward and inward transmission until an adequate degree of herd immunity is achieved through vaccination. Lastly, the SSEs of SARS-CoV-2 transmission emphasize the importance of reducing contacts by limiting social gatherings. The above-mentioned transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have culminated in the failure of long-lasting quarantine measures, and indicate that only highly effective vaccines can keep the communities safe from this deadly, multifaceted virus.Copyright © 2021.

Scrutinizing the heterogeneous spreading of COVID-19 outbreak in large territorial countries,da Silva R.M.; Mendes C.F.O.; Manchein C. ,"After the spread of COVID-19 out of China, the evolution of the pandemic has shown remarkable similarities and differences between countries around the world. Eventually, such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we introduce a general method that allows us to compare the evolution of the pandemic in different localities inside a large territorial country: in the case of the present study, Brazil. To evaluate our method, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the COVID-19 outbreak until May 30th, 2020, in Brazil and its 27 federative units, which has been seen as the current epicenter of the pandemic in South America. Each one of the federative units may be considered a cluster of interacting people with similar habits and distributed to a highly heterogeneous demographic density over the entire country. Our first set of results regarding the time-series analysis shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for federative units of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the distance correlation calculated between the time series of the most affected federative units and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 over most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the federative units with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. In the second set of results, we focus on the heterogeneous distribution of the confirmed cases and deaths. By applying the epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered-dead model we estimated the effective reproduction number (ERN) [Formula: see text] during the pandemic evolution and found that: (i) the mean value of [Formula: see text] for the eight most affected federative units in Brazil is about 2; (ii) the current value of [Formula: see text] for Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far off; and (iii) Ceara was the only federative unit for which the current [Formula: see text]. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase or decrease of the ERN and concluded that if the value of [Formula: see text] increases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health-care system.

"Anatomy of digital contact tracing: Role of age, transmission setting, adoption and case detection",Moreno Lopez J.A.; Garcia B.A.; Bentkowski P.; Bioglio L.; Pinotti F.; Boelle P.-Y.; Barrat A.; Colizza V.; Poletto C. ,"The efficacy of digital contact tracing against COVID-19 epidemic is debated: smartphone penetration is limited in many countries, non-uniform across age groups, with low coverage among elderly, the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. We developed an agent-based model to precise the impact of digital contact tracing and household isolation on COVID-19 transmission. The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact-survey and epidemiological information to describe the risk factors for exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio [Formula: see text] and 50% detection of clinical cases, a ~20% app adoption reduces peak incidence by ~35%. With [Formula: see text], >30% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels. Higher coverage among adults, playing a central role in COVID-19 transmission, yields an indirect benefit for elderly.

ES16.06 Insights in Global Lung Cancer Patient Experience,Leigh L. ,"Introduction: While access to health care is free in Australia, access to lung cancer treatments is not always affordable or timely, especially for a rare cancer patient like the author. Diagnosed with ROS1+ NSCLC, the author had to crowdfund to pay for her first targeted therapy the price of which exceeded what most Australians could afford. Acutely aware that her participation in a subsequent clinical trial is uncommon for someone with a similar minority background, the author seeks to explore the concept of patient experience in the context of diversity and inequity. Patient experience is multidimensional and integrated. The quality and safety of services provided, the costs incurred, and the outcomes achieved are all important facets of the patient experience [1]. The ultimate goals of advocates are to achieve optimal patient experience by ensuring that patients' needs are heard, and problems are resolved. To do this effectively, advocates must understand the unmet needs of the patients they seek to represent. However, lung cancer patient experience is not homogenous and is impacted by social determinants. In Australia, lung cancer outcomes differ across socioeconomic status (SES), indigenous status and remoteness. For example: (a) the incidence rates of lung cancer in 2010-14 were 27% higher in remote and very remote areas combined, compared to major Australian cities; (b) the mortality rate was highest in the lowest SES areas (SES1, 38.5 per 100,000 persons), compared to the highest SES areas (SES5, 20.1 per 100,000 persons); and (c) the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer in 2010-2014 was 8.5% for Indigenous Australians compared to 14.2% for non-Indigenous Australians [2]. Health inequities exist both within and among countries [3], so the lung cancer patient experience would no doubt also differ within and between countries. The aim of this presentation is to draw insights from the author's lung cancer patient experience as well as patient anecdotes from other countries and continents. Method(s): Three separate interviews were conducted through a cloud-based video conference service. The interviewees were asked to share stories of lung cancer patient experience in their country, observations on key areas of improvement, and comments on how the global lung cancer community can support them. Result(s): The interviewees comprised of two female lung cancer patients from the Netherlands and New Zealand, and a male lung cancer advocate from Nigeria. Interview 1: Experience from The Netherlands: The insights of the patient advocate from the Netherlands were mostly very positive. She described her experience of free access to healthcare, timely and free access to treatment, optimal level of nursing care, and integrated psychosocial services. While there remains is a need to address stigma systematically and collaboratively, the interviewee observes that lung cancer care in the Netherlands may be held as a model for healthcare. Interview 2: Experience from New Zealand: The anecdotes shared by the patient advocate from New Zealand somewhat differ. While access to healthcare is free, most lung cancer patients are treated by general oncologists. The patient advocate's key area of concern is the limited access to biomarker testing, treatment options and clinicals trials. She calls on the global lung cancer community to raise awareness about the lack of treatment options in New Zealand. Interview 3: Experience from Nigeria: The third interview was with a former caregiver and advocate from Nigeria provided anecdotes and observations that were drastically different from the others. Tragically, because healthcare costs are not subsidized and can be prohibitive, many people do not get diagnosed at all. If diagnosed, a lung cancer patient would attend a general cancer clinic to see a general oncologist. Treatment options are very limited as there is currently no access to any lung cancer biomarker testing, targeted therapy or immunotherapy. There are currently no lung cancer clinical trials in Nigeria. The interviewee described feelings of sadness and despair when watching presentations on global lung cancer research and medical advancements. He believes that the first step to tackle the dire position of lung cancer patients in Nigeria and Africa is to understand the current standard of lung cancer care in these respective areas. He calls on the global community to provide support in that regard. Conclusion(s): Lung cancer patient experience is not only multidimensional but also diverse. The key insights drawn from the interviews are that, to ensure a comprehensive lung cancer patient experience, it is crucial that: (a) lung cancer advocates are aware and mindful of social determinants as well as issues that can significantly impact on patient outcomes, including inequity, accessibility, resourcing and poverty; (b) lung cancer researchers, clinicians and policy makers actively address disparities by engaging with a wide variety of patients and caregivers in their work; and (c) the lung cancer global community is sensitive to the impact of accelerating medical advancements on the widening gap of global health inequities, and ensure that all communication is appropriately respectful. The reduction of inequities is a moral obligation [4]. It may be difficult to comprehend in the year of the dawn of COVID-19, but it is time for us to advance beyond just tackling diseases. It is our collective ethical responsibility to consider the whole patient experience in all aspects of lung cancer care, and to do so through the lenses of health inequities. As the World Health Organisation states ""[r]educing health inequities is... an ethical imperative. Social injustice is killing people on a grand scale.""

P09.44 Outcomes of Covid-19 Infection in Lung Cancer Patients: Experience from a Large Tertiary Care Cancer Center,Munawar K.; Sheikh H. ,"Introduction: SARS-COV-2 or Covid-19 has become a major contributor of significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Patients with cancer constitute a high risk group. Furthermore, presence of lung cancer, advanced stage and active immune-suppressive treatment has been associated with poor outcomes. We sought to evaluate the outcomes of lung cancer patients with PCR confirmed Covid-19 infection at a large tertiary care referral cancer center. Method(s): We identified all the patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung carcinoma that tested positive for Covid-19 by RT-PCR at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan. We used our electronic medical records to retrospectively retrieve and analyze the data. Result(s): Of the 7 patients identified that met our study criteria, 71.4% were males and 28.6% were females. 42.9% had metastatic disease. Age ranged from 26-67 years. Most patients did not have any co-morbidity except diabetes mellitus in 14.3% and essential hypertension in 28.6%. 42.9% of the patients were on active IV cytotoxic chemotherapy, 28.6% were on surveillance post treatment and 28.6% were on palliative care. Nil patient had received immunotherapy. Cough was the leading presenting complaint (71.4%) followed by fever (57.1%), and shortness of breath (42.9%). One patient (14.3%) was asymptomatic at the time of presentation. None of our patients reported contact exposure or recent travel history. After testing positive for COVID-19 by PCR, 28.6% of patients met the criteria for home isolation while 71.4% required hospitalization. Of those who were hospitlaized 80% were managed in the isolation COVID-ward. One patient required admission in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Mean length of hospital stay was 8 days. Of the 7 patients, three (42.9%) had hemoglobin less than 11gm/dl, and TLC greater than 11(x109/l). Ferritin level was found to be raised in all the four (57.1%) patients who were tested. D-Dimers were normal in 14.3%, high in 28.6% and not done in 57.1% patients. On radiographic imaging, 42.8% patients had consolidation and airspace disease while 28.6% showed no changes. Imaging was not performed in 1 patient. Those who were home isolated were given symptomatic treatment only. Of those who were hospitalized, all 5(100%) received symptomatic treatment and antibiotics in addition to therapeutic anticoagulation (2 patients, 40%), non-invasive ventilation (3 patients, 60%) and steroids (4 patients, 80%). Overall, four (57.1%) patients fully recovered while three patients (42.9%) died. Fatality rate for the hospitalized was 60% and nil for those who were home-isolated. 2/3rd of the patients on active chemotherapy and 1/3rd of patients with advanced stage of the lung cancer died of Covid-19 infection. Conclusion(s): Our limited data suggests that covid-19 infection in lung cancer patients is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While overall infection rate in our lung cancer population is unknown, almost 2/3rd of confirmed cases required hospitalization and more than half of them died of complication of covid-19 infection. Patients on active chemotherapy particularly had a high mortality rate. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of covid-19 infection in lung cancer patients.

P09.33 Outcomes of Patients with Lung Cancer Tested for COVID-19 in a Chicago Hospital System (LungCOVID-Chicago),Nguyen R.; Fernandez K.; Pasquinelli M.; Liu L.; Feldman L. ,"Introduction: Patients with lung cancer have a high risk for COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality given the cumulative risk factors for COVID-19 complications and unavoidable addition of treatment-related immune suppression. As the symptoms of COVID-19 present similarly to symptoms of lung cancer and treatment-related complications, there is an urgent need to identify early those patients with COVID-19 in an attempt to reduce the risk of severe complications and mortality. The University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) is a safety-net, tertiary referral center located in Chicago, Illinois. In April of 2020, UIH implemented policies requiring testing of all patients for COVID-19 upon admission as well testing of all patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy regardless of symptoms. Method(s): We conducted a single-site retrospective study to describe the incidence rate of COVID-19 among patients with lung cancer and clinical outcomes of those who tested positive versus negative for COVID-19 in study population. Eligible cases were patients with a history of primary lung cancer who had been tested for COVID-19 between 1/1/2020 and 7/1/2020. Cases were identified by treating clinicians and the electronic medical record of eligible patients were reviewed for data abstraction into a standardized form in REDCap. 95% confidence interval estimate was calculated for the proportion of positive case among lung cancer patients. Two-sample proportion z-test was performed to test the difference between the rates of hospital admission and mortality between those with positive or negative test results. Result(s): A total of 59 patients with lung cancer were tested for COVID-19 over the study period. The median age was 66 years old. 61% of patients were Black, 19% White, and 10% Hispanic. Fifty-three (90%) of patients had stage III or IV disease by time of their initial COVID-19 test and 43 (73%) had received anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of their initial COVID-19 test. Nine patients (15.3%, 95% CI=0.072-0.270) tested positive for COVID-19. Of those who tested positive, 7 (77.8%) required hospital admission and 4 (44.4%) died. Of those who did not test positive, 15 (30%) required hospital admission and 8 (16%) died. Comparing between those who tested positive versus negative for COVID-19, hospitalization rate was 47.8% higher (p-value=0.0063) and mortality rate was 28.4% higher (p-value=0.0513) in those that tested positive. COVID-19 related deaths accounted for 33% (4/12) of deaths among the study population. Conclusion(s): In this single-institution, retrospective study, we found patients with lung cancer had a high rate of COVID-19 incidence (15.3%). For those who tested positive, we also found a significantly higher rate of hospital admission (77.8%) and mortality (44.4%). More studies are needed on risk-reduction strategies to prevent these patients from developing COVID-19 illness and the resulting morbidity and mortality.

There was an incidental detection of thrombus in right main and descending pulmonary artery. She was diagnosed to have ROS1 rearranged advanced NSCLC with pulmonary embolism. She was initiated on conventional chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed along with anticoagulation. After fourth cycle of chemotherapy, although there was clinical improvement attributed to reduction of amount of effusion and disappearance thrombus, RECIST 1.1 criteria suggested the progression of disease in view of appearance of adrenal metastasis. Meanwhile, she had a history of high risk exposure with a patient of COVID- 19 in July 2020. Although she was asymptomatic, RT- PCR for SARS-COV2 came out to be positive. Result(s): She remained asymptomatic for next 10 days during hospitalization. Then she was started on Crizotinib and was discharged with advice on further follow up.

P31.01 A False Alarm of COVID-19 Pneumonia in Lung Cancer: A Case Report of Anti-PD-1 Related Pneumonitis,Dai Y.; Li X.; Zhao Z.; Liu S.; Zhang Y.; Liu P. ,"Introduction: The inhibition of immune checkpoint therapy emerged as the novel treatment in advanced lung cancer, including anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies. The fatal toxicity of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents is pneumonitis, which is defined as a noninfectious inflammation to the lung parenchyma. The diagnosis of pneumonitis consists of the history of immunotherapy, clinical symptoms and presentation of computed tomography (CT) imaging. The typical CT findings include ground-glass opacities. Based on the similar radiographic feature with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, clinicians are cautious to evaluate diagnosis especially in COVID-19 epidemic areas. Method(s): Herein we report a 67-year-old male patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer developed pneumonitis post 10 cycles of Sintilimab injection. The dyspnea appeared at the 15th day of close contact with his son who returned from Wuhan, but not accompanied with fever. The chest CT (Fig. 1A) indicated peripherally subpleural lattice opacities at the inferior right lung lobe and bilateral thoracic infusion. The complete blood count showed increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophilic granulocyte with concurrent decreased lymphocyte. The C reaction protein (CRP) level was high with normal value of procalcitonin. As suspect of COVID-19 infection, the patient was treated in isolation ward and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) from double swab samples within 72 hours remained negative. No pathogen was found from sputum culture. The patient was thereafter treated the daily dose of 80 mg prednisolone and meropenem for 7 days. At the third day post treatment, the chest CT (Fig. 1B) showed attenuated inflammatory lesion. The daily dose of prednisolone was stepwise reduced to 40mg for 7 days and then minimally 20mg. Secondary to 7 days of piperacillin tazobactam injection, the chest CT (Fig. 1C) demonstrated the former lesion almost absorbed, in line with prominently falling CRP level. [Formula presented] Results: The anti-PD-1 related pneumonitis with bacterial infection was diagnosed finally based on the clinical evidence and good response to the prednisolone and antibiotics. Conclusion(s): Both ani-PD-1 related pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia harbor the common clinical symptom and the varied features of CT imaging. Differential diagnosis was based on the epidemiological and immunotherapy histories, RT-PCR tests. The response to glucocorticoid can indirectly help the diagnosis.

Temporal and spatial analysis of COVID-19 transmission in China and its influencing factors,Wang Q.; Dong W.; Yang K.; Ren Z.; Huang D.; Zhang P.; Wang J. ,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and its influencing factors in China from January to October 2020. METHOD(S): About 81,000 COVID-19 confirmed case data, Baidu migration index data, air pollutants, meteorological data, and government response strictness index data were collected from 31 provincial-level regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) and 337 prefecture-level cities. The spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 were explored using spatial autocorrelation, hot spot, and spatio-temporal scanning statistics. At the same time, Spearman rank correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and confirmed COVID-19 cases. RESULT(S): The distribution of COVID-19 in China tends to be stable over time, with spatial correlation and obvious clustering regions. spatio-temporal scanning analysis showed that most COVID-19 high incidence months were from January to March at the beginning of the epidemic, and the area with the highest aggregation risk was Hubei Province (RR=491.57), which was 491.57 times the aggregation risk of other regions. Among the meteorological variables, the daily average temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and new COVID-19 cases were negatively correlated. The air pollution concentration and migration index were positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the government response strict index was strongly negatively correlated with confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION(S): Environmental temperature has a certain inhibitory effect on the transmission of COVID-19, and the air pollution concentration and migration index have a certain promoting effect on the transmission of COVID-19. The strict government response index indicates that the greater the intensity of government intervention, the fewer COVID-19 cases will occur.Copyright © 2021.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mortuary and Cemetery Workers,Alishaq M.; Jeremijenko A.; Nafady-Hego H.; Al Ajmi J.A.; Elgendy M.; Fadel R.A.A.; Thomas A.G.; Alahmed M.A.A.; Ammar A.; Bensaad M.; Al-Barghouthi B.; Coyle P.; Elgendy H.; Abou-Samra A.-B.; Butt A.A. ,"BACKGROUND: Mortuary and cemetery workers may be exposed to bodies of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, prevalence of infection among these groups is unknown. METHOD(S): Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for RT-PCR and serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on mortuary and cemetery workers in Qatar. We gathered data on specific job duties, living conditions, contact history, and clinical course. Environmental sampling was carried out to explore any association with infection. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with infection. RESULT(S): All 47 mortuary workers provided a NPS and 7(14.9%) were PCR-positive; 32 provided a blood sample and 8 (25%) were antibody positive, 6 (75%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided a NPS and 5 (6.6%) were PCR-positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, 3 (13.6%) of seropositive were also PCR-positive. Three (22.2 %) and 20 (83.3%) of infected mortuary and cemetery were asymptomatic. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95%CI 1.7-14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7-13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95%CI 1.9-42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial proportion of mortuary and cemetery workers have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is incidentally detected upon serologic testing.

"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in six districts in Zambia in July, 2020: a cross-sectional cluster sample survey",Mulenga L.B.; Hines J.Z.; Fwoloshi S.; Chirwa L.; Siwingwa M.; Yingst S.; Wolkon A.; Barradas D.T.; Favaloro J.; Zulu J.E.; Banda D.; Nikoi K.I.; Kampamba D.; Banda N.; Chilopa B.; Hanunka B.; Stevens T.L.; Shibemba A.; Mwale C.; Sivile S.; Zyambo K.D.; Makupe A.; Kapina M.; Mweemba A.; Sinyange N.; Kapata N.; Zulu P.M.; Chanda D.; Mupeta F.; Chilufya C.; Mukonka V.; Agolory S.; Malama K. ,"BACKGROUND: Between March and December, 2020, more than 20000 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Zambia. However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHOD(S): Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 18.2 years (IQR 7.7-31.4) and 50.6% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 10.6% (95% CI 7.3-13.9). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 7.6% (4.7-10.6) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.1% (1.1-3.1). An estimated 454708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312705-596713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission. FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Demographics and management of paediatric dental-facial trauma in the 'lockdown' period: A UK perspective,Ilyas N.; Green A.; Karia R.; Sood S.; Fan K. ,"BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom entered 'lockdown' on the 23 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in school closures forcing children to remain at home. Dental-facial trauma was still likely to be common place due to falls and injuries exercising. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in a paediatric population in a tertiary care hospital and a linked Dental Institute. METHOD(S): A proforma was designed to capture the demographics, presenting complaints, type of dental-facial injury, treatment need and the treatment received for all paediatric patients presenting face to face with dental-facial trauma to King's College Hospital during the 'lockdown' period (23 March- 14 June 2020). RESULT(S): Four hundred and twenty calls were triaged, converting to 102 patients seen face-to-face for dental-facial trauma. The remainder were able to be triaged 'virtually'. Injuries seen included 56 (54.9%) dentoalveolar injuries, 37 (36.2%) lacerations, five (4.9%) suspected facial fractures and four (3.9%) dog bites. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of incidents occurred in the home environment (n = 60, 58.8%), with the remainder (n = 42, 41.2%) occurring outside the home environment. The main causes of dental-facial trauma were falls (n = 47, 46.1%) and bicycles/scooters (n = 29, 28.4%). The most common type of dentoalveolar injury was lateral luxation (n = 15, 26.7%), followed by avulsion (n = 12, 21.4%). Only one child required treatment under general anaesthesia (GA). CONCLUSION(S): The demographic, presenting complaints and treatment needs of patients who presented during the lockdown period with dental-facial trauma were unusual. The overwhelming majority were able to be treated without the use of GA. The attendance protocol in a tertiary care setting and the use of 'teledentistry' ensured only the most severe trauma cases were seen. This highlights how more complex trauma can still occur during 'lockdown' and requires immediate management.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although many articles have established the clinical characteristics of adult COVID-19 patients so far, limited data are available for children. The aim of this study was to reveal the clinical features, laboratory findings and nucleic acid test results of ten pediatric cases. Method(s): In this retrospective single-center cohort study, pediatric cases with COVID-19 infection were consecutively enrolled in one hospital in Huangshi, China from January 1 to March 11, 2020. Result(s): A total of 10 children with COVID-19 were recruited. Of them, four were the asymptomatic type, one was the mild type, and five were the moderate type (including two subclinical ones). All patients were from family clusters. Only fever, nasal discharge and nasal congestion were observed. Lymphopenia and leukopenia were uncommon in our sample but elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) were observed frequently. Of these laboratory test variables, no statistical difference was identified between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Abnormalities in radiological data were detected in five patients, and representative findings of chest CT images were patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities. There were two cases whose oropharyngeal nucleic acid tests reversed to positive after one negative result, and two patients whose oropharyngeal swabs tested negative but rectal swabs showed positive. Conclusion(s): Clinical symptoms were mild in children with COVID-19. Increased levels of LDH and alpha-HBDH were potential clinical biomarkers for pediatric cases.

The value of quantitative artificial intelligence measurement in evaluation of CT dynamic changes for COVID-19,Du D.; Xie Y.; Li H.; Zhao S.; Ding Y.; Yang P.; Liu B.; Sun J.; Wang X. ,"Objective: To investigate the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted quantitative measurement in evaluation of the dynamic changes of CT for COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): The clinical and chest CT dynamic imaging data of 99 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalized in Wuhan Central Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 15, 2020 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the definitive diagnosis, the 99 patients were classified into common (n=36), severe (n=33) and critical (n=30) type, the CT imaging findings of each type were analyzed, including CT basic signs, total volume of pneumonia lesions and percentage of pneumonia lesions of the total lung volume (volume ratio). AI software was used to quantitatively evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT images. The quantitative indicators included CT peak time of lesions, total volume of lesions peak, volume ratio of lesions peak, maximum growth rate of total volume and maximum growth rate of volume ratio. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to compare the difference of quantitative indexes between the 3 types, and chi2 test or Fisher exact probability test was used to compare the difference of qualitative indexes between the 3 types. Sequence measurement and scatter plots were used to show the evolution trend of the volume ratio of the three types of COVID-19 pneumonia lesions. The ROC curve was used to analyze the value of the volume ratio of pneumonia lesions and its maximum growth rate in predicting the conversion of common pneumonia to severe or critical pneumonia. Result(s): There were statistically significant differences in age and gender distribution among patients with common, severe and critical COVID-19 (P<0.05), the age of severe and critical types were significantly higher than that of common type (P<0.01).

There were statistically significant differences in involvement of multiple lung lobes (20 cases, 29 cases, 25 cases, chi2=10.403, P=0.006) in patients with common, severe and critical COVID-19 at the first scan, the incidence of the involvement of multiple lung lobes in severe and critical types was significantly higher than that of common type (P=0.002). The volume ratios of patients with common, severe and critical COVID-19 at the first scan were statistically significant [1.0% (0.2%, 4.7%), 9.30% (1.63%, 26.83%), 2.10% (0.64%, 8.61%), Z=14.236, P=0.001], and the volume ratio of severe type was significantly higher than that of common type (P<0.001), there was no statistically significant difference between common type and critical type (P=0.062). Follow-up CT showed that the pneumonia lesions showed a dynamic transformation of progress and recovery, and it was seen that the coexistence of multiphase lesions. The trend line in the scatter plot of the three types of COVID-19 pneumonia lesions showed that the lesions in the advanced stage developed from less to more. The lesion peak volume ratios of the common, severe and critical types were 9.75% (4.83%, 13.18%), 29.80% (23.99%, 42.36%) and 61.81% (43.73%, 72.82%), respectively, the difference was statistically significant (Z=74.147, P<0.001). The maximum growth rates of lesion volume ratio were 1.27% (0.50%, 1.81%)/d, 4.39% (3.16%, 5.54%)/d and 6.02% (4.77%, 9.96%)/d, respectively, the difference was statistically significant (Z=52.453, P<0.001). The peak times of lesions were 12.0 (9.0, 15.0) d, 13.0 (10.0, 16.0) d and 16.5 (12.0, 25.0)d, respectively, the difference was statistically significant (Z=9.524, P=0.009). Taking the volume ratio of pneumonia lesion 22.60% and the maximum growth rate of the volume ratio 1.875%/d as the boundary value, the sensitivity of diagnosing common type to severe or critical type was 92.10% and 96.83%, and the specificity was 100% and 80.56%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.987 and 0.925, respectively. Conclusion(s): The lesions of COVID-19 pneumonia show a similar parabolic change on CT imaging. The use of AI technology to dynamitcally and accurately measure the CT pneumonia lesion volume ratio is helpful to evaluate the severity of the disease and predict the development trend of the disease. Patients with a rapid growth of volume ratio are more likely to become severe or critical type.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association",2021,/,Chinese Journal of Radiology (China),55,3,250-256,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112149-20200330-00474,2011496589,#92931,Du 2021,"",""
A multi-center survey on the postpartum mental health of mothers and attachment to their neonates during COVID-19 in Hubei Province of China,Peng S.; Zhang Y.; Liu H.; Huang X.; Noble D.J.; Yang L.; Lu W.; Luo Y.; Zhu H.; Cao L.; Liu C.; Chen Y.; Zhang P.; Xia S.; Narayan A. ,"Background: There is an emerging literature on the mental health of both pre- and post-partum mothers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Method(s): As of April 1, 2020, 23 mothers confirmed with COVID-19, 15 mothers suspected with COVID-19 but with negative polymerase chain reaction tests, and 33 mothers without COVID-19 (Control Group) were recruited for a study from Hubei Province in China. The Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale were applied to investigate the attachment of mothers to their neonates and the postpartum mental health of mothers within the first 3 months after delivery (between 20 to 89 days). Result(s): The period of mother-child separation among the confirmed group (33.9+/-20.9 days) was significantly longer than that of suspected group (16.7+/-12.2 days) and control group (10.7+/-8.4 days). The total score of the MPAS in mothers confirmed with COVID-19 (45.5+/-4.2) was significantly lower (indicating less mother-child attachment) than that in the suspected (50.5+/-4.7) and control (48.8+/-4.6) groups. A negative correlation was noted between the mother-child separation time and the MPAS scores, including the subscale scores of attachment (MPAS acore: Spearman's rho =-0.33, 95% CI: -0.095 to -0.538, P=0.005; Subscale score of attachment: Spearman's rho =-0.40, 95% CI: -0.163 to -0.592, P=0.001). The incidence of postpartum anxiety in the confirmed, suspected and control groups was 4.3%, 6.7% and 12.1%, respectively; and the incidence of postpartum depression was 39.1%, 33.3% and 30.3%, respectively. No significant difference was found with regards to maternal postpartum anxiety and depression among the three groups. Conclusion(s): Decreased mother-child attachment found among mothers confirmed with COVID-19, indicates that further intervention is needed to ensure mother-child interaction to appropriately develop attachment. Mother-child attachment experienced disruption due to prolonged mother-child separation necessitated by the COVID-19 management protocol, which needs to be revised to reduce prolonged mother-child separation. Additionally, mothers with and without COVID-19 suffered a high incidence of depression, which warrants further mental health investment for pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

A subset was compared to immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and micro-neutralisation. Sensitivity and specificity of the Roche (n = 1033), Abbott (n = 806), Diasorin (n = 1034) and Euroimmun (n = 175) were 93.7 %/99.5 %, 90.2 %/99.4 %, 88.6 %/98.6 % and 91.3 %/98.8 %, respectively. ROC analysis with specificity held at 99 % increased the sensitivity for the Roche and Abbott assays from 93.7% to 98.7% (cut-off 0.21) and 90.2 % to 94.0 % (cut-off 0.91), respectively. Overall seropositivity of samples increased from a maximum of 23 % for samples 0-7 days-post-onset of symptoms (dpos), to 61 % from samples 8-14dpos and 93 % from those >14dpos. IFA and microneutralisation values correlated best with assays targeting antibodies to spike protein with values >80 AU/mL on the Diasorin assay associated with neutralising antibody. Detectable antibody was present in 22/23 (96 %), 20/23 (87 %), 15/23 (65 %) and 9/22 (41 %) patients with samples >180dpos on the Roche, Diasorin, Abbott and microneutralisation assays respectively. Given the low prevalence in this community, two-step algorithms on initial positive results saw an increase in the positive predictive value (PPV) of positive samples (39 %-65 % to >=98 %) for all combinations. Similarly accuracy increased from a range of 98.5 %-99.4 % to >=99.8 % assuming a 1 % seroprevalence.

Available evidence suggests that renal involvement in COVID-19 infection is not uncommon, and there has been an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease related to the pandemic. In this literature analysis, we address COVID-19 and its effects on the renal system, including the pathophysiologic mechanisms. We also address current studies on the causes of injury to the renal system, the cause of kidney failure, its effect on mortality, the impact on dialysis patients, and the impact on renal transplant patients.

COVID-19 lockdown impact on the physical activity of adults with progressive muscle diseases,Roberts-Lewis S.F.; Ashworth M.; White C.M.; Rose M.R. ,"Introduction This short article summarises findings about reduced physical activity of adults with progressive muscle disease as a result of COVID-19 lockdown. Methods As part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study, we prospectively and objectively measured physical activity using accelerometry at baseline in 2019 and follow-up in 2020. A subset of 85 participants incidentally had follow-up data collected during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown from 23 March to 4 July 2020. Thus, for this cohort we had activity data from before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and we were able to prospectively and accurately quantify the changes in their physical activity. Results Our data highlighted reduced overall activity intensity and reduced light activity time in particular. Conclusions From our findings, we can infer specific evidence-based recommendations about how to redress inactivity secondary to COVID-19 restrictions for adults with progressive muscle diseases. These recommendations are likely to be generalisable to other groups who are vulnerable to functional decline secondary to prolonged inactivity.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

"1,2,3,4,6-Pentagalloyl Glucose, a RBD-ACE2 Binding Inhibitor to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection",Chen R.H.; Yang L.J.; Hamdoun S.; Chung S.K.; Lam C.W.-K.; Zhang K.X.; Guo X.; Xia C.; Law B.Y.K.; Wong V.K.W. ,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus caused more than 80,155,187 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, which has posed a serious threat to global public health and the economy. The development of vaccines and discovery of novel drugs for COVID-19 are urgently needed. Although the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been launched in many countries recently, the strength of safety, stringent storage condition and the possibly short-term immunized efficacy remain as the major challenges in the popularity and recognition of using vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. With the spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (hACE2), ACE2 is identified as the receptor for the entry and viral infection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, molecular docking and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assay were adopted to determine the direct molecular interactions between natural small-molecule, 1,2,3,4,6-Pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) and the spike-RBD of the SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that PGG preferentially binds to a pocket that contains residues Glu 340 to Lys 356 of spike-RBD with a relatively low binding energy of -8 kcal/mol. BLI assay further confirmed that PGG exhibits a relatively strong binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein in comparison to hACE2. In addition, both ELISA and immunocytochemistry assay proved that PGG blocks SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 dose dependently in cellular level. Notably, PGG was confirmed to abolish the infectious property of RBD-pseudotyped lentivirus in hACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, which mimicked the entry of wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus in human host cells. Finally, maximal tolerated dose (MTD) studies revealed that up to 200 mg/kg/day of PGG was confirmed orally safe in mice. Our findings suggest that PGG may be a safe and potential antiviral agent against the COVID-19 by blockade the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD to hACE2 receptors. Therefore, PGG may be considered as a safe and natural antiviral agent for its possible preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products such as a disinfectant spray or face mask.© Copyright © 2021 Chen, Yang, Hamdoun, Chung, Lam, Zhang, Guo, Xia, Law and Wong.",2021,/,Frontiers in Pharmacology,12,"(Chen, Yang, Hamdoun, Chung, Zhang, Law, Wong) Dr. Neher's Biophysics Laboratory for Innovative Drug Discovery, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macao(Hamdoun) Department of Pharmace",634176,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.634176,634537934,#92895,Chen 2021,"",""
Adherence to Public Health Measures Mitigates the Risk of COVID-19 Infection in Older Adults: A Community-Based Study,Juhn Y.J.; Wi C.-I.; Ryu E.; Sampathkumar P.; Takahashi P.Y.; Yao J.D.; Binnicker M.J.; Natoli T.L.; Evans T.K.; King K.S.; Volpe S.; Pircon J.-Y.; Silvia Damaso; Pignolo R.J. ,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during the reopening period in older adults, given that little is known about the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the United States, nor the actual effects of adherence to recommended public health measures (RPHM) on the risk of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which followed a population-based sample of 2325 adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota to assess the incidence of viral infections. Participants were instructed to self-collect both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, which were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay between May 8, 2020, and June, 30, 2020. We assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects. RESULT(S): A total of 1505 eligible subjects participated in the study whose mean age was 68 years, with 885 (59%) women, 32 (2%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 906 (60%) with high-risk conditions for influenza. The prevalence of other Coronaviridae (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the 2019 to 2020 flu season was 109 (7%), and none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost all participants reported adhering to the RPHM (1,488 [99%] for social distancing, 1,438 [96%] for wearing mask in a public space, 1,476 [98%] for hand hygiene, and 1,441 (96%) for staying home mostly). Eighty-six percent of participants resided in a single-family home. CONCLUSION(S): We did not identify SARS-COV-2 infection in our study cohort. The combination of participants' behavior in following the RPHM and their living environment may considerably mitigate the risk of COVID-19.Copyright © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Investigation of beta-lactoglobulin derived bioactive peptides against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): In silico analysis,Cakir B.; Okuyan B.; Sener G.; Tunali-Akbay T. ,"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which started in late 2019 in Wuhan, China spread to the whole world in a short period of time, and thousands of people have died due to this epidemic. Although scientists have been searching for methods to manage SARS-CoV-2, there is no specific medication against COVID-19 as of yet. Two main approaches should be followed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2; one of which is to neutralize the virus, and the other is to inhibit the host cell membrane receptors, where SARS-CoV-2 will bind. In this study, peptides derived from beta-lactoglobulin, which inactivates both the virus and its receptors in the host cell, were identified using computer-based in silico analysis. The beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides used in this study were obtained by the treatment of goat milk whey fraction with trypsin. The structure of the peptides was characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS), and six beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides were selected as candidate peptides. Subsequently, the effects of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and host cells were identified using virtual screening. According to the results of this in silico analysis, Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALMPHIR) and Ile-Pro-Ala-Val-Phe-Lys (IPAVFK) peptides were evaluated as potential candidates to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 after the future in vitro and in vivo studies.Copyright © 2020",2021,/,European Journal of Pharmacology,891,"(Cakir) Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, Food and Agricultural Research Center, Istanbul, Turkey(Okuyan) Marmara University, School of Pharmacy, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey(Sener) Marmara University, School of Pharmacy, Departmen",173781,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173781,2010257149,#92764,Cakir 2021,"",""
Quick overview of diagnostic kits and smartphone apps for urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review,Park H.; Jin P.; Jung S.; Kim J. ,"The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented event that has caused incredible challenges in all areas of society. However, unlike previous global pandemics, modern advancements in technology and medicine have made it possible to respond much more rapidly. Within months, countries around the world developed diagnostic kits and smartphone applications to tackle the virus. Many of these diagnostic kits vary in what they target and have different uses. Smartphone applications have been developed to provide real-time information to users regarding potential exposure, statistics, updated news, etc. Depending on the country, resources and government policies have created a wide range of products and applications. This narrative review paper focuses on providing a general overview of diagnostic kits and smartphone applications in three major countries, the U.S., South Korea, and China. Smartphone applications were used for tracing person-to-person contact and preventing the spread of COVID-19. These tools allowed public health officials to quickly identify people who may have had exposure to COVID-19 and allows them to act accordingly. In addition to discussing the mechanisms behind diagnostic kits, topics in legislation and policy for contact tracing will also be discussed. As nations enter into the next phase of the pandemic, there are serious considerations to be made about how technology can be integrated into handling future healthcare crises.Copyright © Translational Andrology and Urology.

We aimed to analyze the risk factors and the incidence of thrombosis from patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Material/Methods: Eighty-eight inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were reported (31 critical cases, 33 severe cases, and 24 common cases). The thrombosis risk factor assessment, laboratory results, ultrasonographic findings, and prognoses of these patients were analyzed, and compared among groups with different severity. Result(s): Nineteen of the 88 cases developed DVT (12 critical cases, 7 severe cases, and no common cases). In addition, among the 18 patients who died, 5 were diagnosed with DVT. Positive correlations were observed between the increase in D-dimer level (35 microg/mL) and the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia (r=0.679, P<0.01), and between the high Padua score (34) and the severity (r=0.799, P<0.01). In addition, the CRP and LDH levels on admission had positive correlations with the severity of illness (CRP: r=0.522, P<0.01; LDH: r=0.600, P<0.01). A negative correlation was observed between the lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of illness (r=-0.523, P<0.01). There was also a negative correlation between the lymphocyte count on admission and mortality in critical patients (r=-0.499, P<0.01). Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that the occurrence of DVT was positively correlated with disease severity (crude odds ratio: 3.643, 95% CI: 1.218-10.896, P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Our report illustrates that critically or severely ill patients have an associated high D-dimer value and high Padua score, and illustrates that a low threshold to screen for DVT may help improve detection of thromboembolism in these groups of patients, especially in asymptomatic patients.

"Mutations in the sars-cov-2 spike protein modulate the virus affinity to the human ace2 receptor, an in silico analysis",Ortega J.T.; Pujol F.H.; Jastrzebska B.; Rangel H.R. ,"The increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with highly transmissible phenotypes is a health-pub-lic concern in the current pandemic scenario. Herein, we developed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the changes occurring upon mutations in the viral spike. We focused on mutants located in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and analyzed whether these mutants modulate the interaction with the human host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Thirty-two highly prevalent mutants were retrieved from the GISAID database, and their structural models were built using the SWISS-Model server. The stabilization effect for each mutation was assessed by the DUET and DeepDGG software. By applying molecular docking using both Z-Dock and Haddock software we found that multiple mutations, including A475V, V455E, V445L, and V445I, resulted in the higher binding free energy as compared to the wild type (WT) spike protein, thus had a destabilizing effect on the binding to ACE2. On the other hand, several mutants, including the most prevalent N501Y and B.1.1.7 variants, as well as the K444R, L455F, Q493R, and Y505W variants exhibited lower binding free energy as compared to the WT spike. These mutants showed an increased number of electrostatic interactions with ACE2 than the WT spike protein, and they changed the interaction pattern of the neighboring residues. Together, the results presented in this study contribute to a better understanding of the changes in the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the human host ACE2 receptor associated with point mutations in the viral spike protein.Copyright © 2021, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.

We found that CD8+ T cells in the CR cohort had higher numbers of effector T cells and effector memory T cells but lower Tc1 (IFN-gamma+), Tc2 (IL-4+), and Tc17 (IL-17A+) cell frequencies. The CD4+ T cells of the CR cohort were decreased in frequency, especially the central memory T cell subset. Moreover, CD4+ T cells in the CR cohort showed lower PD-1 expression and had lower frequencies of Th1 (IFN-gamma+), Th2 (IL-4+), Th17 (IL-17A+), and circulating follicular helper T (CXCR5+PD-1+) cells. Accordingly, the proportion of isotype-switched memory B cells (IgM-CD20hi) among B cells in the CR cohort showed a significantly lower proportion, although the level of the activation marker CD71 was elevated. For CD3-HLA-DR- lymphocytes in the CR cohort, in addition to lower levels of IFN-gamma, granzyme B, and T-bet, the correlation between T-bet and IFN-gamma was not observed. Additionally, by taking into account the number of days after discharge, all the phenotypes associated with reduced function did not show a tendency toward recovery within 4-11 weeks. The remarkable phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes in the CR cohort suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly affects lymphocytes and potentially results in dysfunction even after clinical recovery.

"COVID-19 pandemic period, where are the seasonal viruses?.","Mansuy, Jean-Michel; Bourcier, Maximin; Tremeaux, Pauline; Dimeglio, Chloe; Izopet, Jacques","Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health authorities have been advocating for the generalization of non-pharmaceutical measures to fight the spread of the disease. Such measures such as physical distancing, mask wearing, tightened basic hygiene, quarantine and even curfews are effective to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to decrease the virus reproductive number R0. At the same time, these measures have had a drastic effect on influenza viruses and RSV, which are currently absent. In contrast and surprisingly, Rhinoviruses continue to circulate but in younger people, unlike in previous years when they were found in all age groups.

Level up for culture models - How 3D cell culture models benefit SARS-CoV-2 research.,"Hafner, Sophia Julia","Welcome to a new decade and a new issue of the Biomedical Journal - casting a sorrowful look onto a year that will go down in history as a tombstone etched by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also a hopeful glance into the future, now that multiple vaccination programs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus have started. This issue is dedicated to the continuous effort by researchers all around the globe to understand and counter the pathogen, as well as to be better prepared for future threats. Therefore, we learn about the advantages of complex 3D cell culture models for studying host-virus interactions, and the disease course of COVID-19 in children. Moreover, we discover how neutralising monoclonal antibodies and peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are developed, and the therapeutic potentials of lopinavir/ritonavir, mesenchymal stem cells, as well as plant and algae extracts.

Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (CDs) (i.e. time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (SIs) (i.e. time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions., OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by (i) estimating the CDs, SIs, effective reproductive number (Rt), and the proportion of asymptomatic cases; (ii) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the CDs and SIs; and (iii) depicting the COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings., METHODS: We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong in January-August 2020. The empirical CDs and SIs were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (PC), which was the percentage change in the predicted outcome (from multivariable regression models) relative to a predefined comparator. Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for SIs., RESULTS: The two epidemic waves were featured by imported cases and clusters of local cases respectively. Rt rose to peak at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 36.4% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (>=80 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 CDs (mean:5.18 days; standard deviation [SD]:3.04) and the 558 SIs (17 negative) (mean:4.74 days; SD:4.24). CDs decreased with involvement in a cluster (PC:10.08-20.73%) and case detection in the public healthcare sector (PC:27.56%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:22.52, 32.33). SIs decreased over time (6.70 days [wave 1] versus 4.35 days [wave 2]) and with the tertiary transmission or beyond (PC: -17.31% to -50.75%), but was lengthened by mobility (PC: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%); and households (69.9%), followed by social settings (20.3%), were two most common settings at which the transmission happened., CONCLUSIONS: First, the factors associated with reduced CDs suggested government-enacted interventions (such as public mode of case detection) were useful to achieve outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, shorter SIs associated with the composite mobility index called for empirical surveys that disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases reminded the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory. Fifth, the high proportion of transmission events within the same age groups supported the ban on gatherings outside of households, and that in household pushed forward the need for residence-center preventive measures., CLINICALTRIAL: Not applicable.",2021,/,Journal of medical Internet research,,100959882,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26645,33750740,#91160,Kwok 2021,"",""
Mask wearing hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic in south Iran.,"Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Nezafat, Abdullah; Sadeghian, Saeid; Shahisavandi, Mina; Nabavizadeh, Seyed Ali; Barzegar, Zohreh","PURPOSE: The aim of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of face mask wearing among different groups of people in south Iran. We also investigated the associations between mask wearing hesitancy and various factors., METHODS: We surveyed a sample (convenience sampling) of five groups of people: general population, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus, people with cardiac problems, and people with psychiatric problems. The survey included four general questions [age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem] and four COVID-19 specific questions [contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask while in crowded places, and the frequency of daily hand washings]., RESULTS: 582 people (153 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with diabetes mellitus, 98 people with cardiac problems, 96 patients with psychiatric disorders, and 108 healthy individuals) participated. 28 (4.8%) people expressed that they do not wear a face mask when at crowded places. A lower education and less frequent daily hand washings had associations with mask wearing hesitancy., CONCLUSION: Mask wearing hesitancy is a concern during a respiratory viral disease pandemic.

Retinal microvascular signs in COVID-19.,"Sim, Ralene; Cheung, Gemmy; Ting, Daniel; Wong, Edmund; Wong, Tien Yin; Yeo, Ian; Wong, Chee Wai","BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore if retinal findings are associated with COVID-19 infection., METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we recruited participants positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab, with no medical history. Subjects underwent retinal imaging with an automated imaging device (3D OCT-1 Maestro, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain colour fundus photographs (CFP) and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) scans of the macula. Data on personal biodata, medical history and vital signs were collected from electronic medical records., RESULTS: 108 patients were recruited. Mean age was 36.0+/-5.4 years. 41 (38.0%) had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at presentation. Of 216 eyes, 25 (11.6%) had retinal signs-eight (3.7%) with microhaemorrhages, six (2.8%) with retinal vascular tortuosity and two (0.93%) with cotton wool spots (CWS). 11 eyes (5.1%) had hyper-reflective plaques in the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer layer on OCT, of which two also had retinal signs visible on CFP (CWS and microhaemorrhage, respectively). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of retinal signs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients (12 (15.0%) vs 13 (9.6%), p=0.227). Patients with retinal signs were significantly more likely to have transiently elevated blood pressure than those without (p=0.03)., CONCLUSION: One in nine had retinal microvascular signs on ocular imaging. These signs were observed even in asymptomatic patients with normal vital signs. These retinal microvascular signs may be related to underlying cardiovascular and thrombotic alternations associated with COVID-19 infection. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

From April 2020, there is growing evidence on the benefits of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for patients with humoral immunodeficiency. Most of them had a congenital primary immunodeficiency or were on treatment with anti CD20 antibodies. We report on three patients treated in our hospital and review thirty-one more cases described in the literature. All patients but three resolved clinical picture with CCP. A dose from 200 to 800ml was enough in most cases. Antibody levels after transfusion were negative or low, suggesting consumption of them in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. These patients have a protracted clinical course shortened after CCP. CCP could be helpful for patients with humoral immunodeficiency. It avoid relapses and chronification.

Prevalence and stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on Bangladeshi banknotes.,"Akter, Selina; Roy, Pravas Chandra; Ferdaus, Amina; Ibnat, Habiba; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Nigar, Shireen; Jahid, Iqbal Kabir; Hossain, M Anwar","Originating in December 2019 in China, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as the deadliest pandemic in humankind's history. Along with direct contact and droplet contaminations, the possibility of infections through contaminated surfaces and fomites is investigating. This study aims to assess SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA's prevalence by real-time one-step reverse transcriptase PCR on banknotes circulating in Bangladesh. We also evaluated the persistence of the virus on banknotes spiked with SARS-CoV-2 positive diluted human nasopharyngeal samples. Among the 425 banknote samples collected from different entities, 7.29% (n = 31) were tested positive for targeted genes. Twenty-four positive representative samples were assessed for n gene fragments by conventional PCR and sequenced. All the samples that carry viral RNA belonged to the GR clade, the predominantly circulating clade in Bangladesh. In the stability test, the n gene was detected for up to 72 h on banknotes spiked with nasopharyngeal samples, and CT values increase significantly with time (p < 0.05). orf1b gene was observed to be less stable, especially on old banknotes, and usually went beyond detectable limit within 8 to 10 h. The stability of virus RNA well fitted by the Weibull model and concave curve for new banknotes and convex curve for old banknotes revealed. Handling banknotes is unavoidable; hence, these findings imply that proper hygiene practice is needed to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission through banknotes. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Clinical characteristics, symptoms, and use of supportive therapies including medications and non-pharmacological interventions in the last three days of life were extracted., RESULTS: The cohort comprised 58 patients (median age 87 years IQR 81, 90) predominantly admitted from home (n = 30), who died after a median of 11 days (IQR 6, 28) in the acute medical (n = 31) or aged care (n = 27) wards of the hospital. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 7 (IQR 5,8).

Targeting Fc effector function in vaccine design.,"Richardson, Simone I; Moore, Penny L","INTRODUCTION: Antibodies mediate pathogen neutralization, as well as several cytotoxic Fc functions by engaging cellular receptors and recruiting effector cells. Fc effector functions have been well described in disease control and protection against infectious diseases including HIV, Ebola, malaria, influenza and tuberculosis, making them attractive targets for vaccine design., AREAS COVERED: We briefly summarize the role of Fc effector functions in disease control and protection in viral, bacterial and parasitic infectious diseases. We review Fc effector function in passive immunization and vaccination, and primarily focus on strategies to elicit and modulate these functions as part of a robust vaccine strategy., EXPERT OPINION: Despite their known correlation with vaccine efficacy for several diseases, only recently have seminal studies addressed how these Fc effector functions can be elicited and modulated in vaccination. However, gaps remain in assay standardization and the precise mechanisms of diverse functional assays. Furthermore, there are inherent difficulties in the translation of findings from animal models to humans, given the difference in sequence, expression and function of Fc receptors and Fc portions of antibodies. Overall, however, it is clear that vaccine development to elicit Fc effector function is an important goal for optimal prevention against infectious disease.",2021,/,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,,101127833,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2021.1907343,33754933,#91171,Richardson 2021,"",""

Effect of COVID-19 home confinement in people with multiple sclerosis: sleep and cardiac autonomic function monitorization.,"Luis, Andreu-Caravaca; Domingo, Ramos-Campo; Pedro, Manonelles; Oriol, Abellan-Aynes; H, Chung Linda; Jacobo A, Rubio-Arias","BACKGROUND: Low sleep quality, cardiac autonomic dysfunction and poor quality of life are some of the most prevalent symptoms in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In addition to the progression of the disease, these symptoms are aggravated by physical inactivity. Therefore, home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions could further worsen these symptoms. This study aims to analyze the effect of home confinement on objective and subjective sleep quality, cardiac autonomic control based on heart rate variability (HRV), and health-related quality of life in people with MS., METHODS: Actigraphic and subjective sleep quality (Karolinska Sleep Diary, KSD), HRV (Polar-H7), and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54) were measured before and after 2 months of home confinement in 17 people with MS (7:10 men/women; age: 43.41+/-10.88 years; body mass index: 24.87+/-3.31 kg/m2; Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.85+/-1.34 a.u.)., RESULTS: Actigraphic sleep quality (sleep efficiency: ES=1.27, p=0.01, sleep time: ES=0.81, p=0.01) and subjective sleep quality (sleep quality: ES=-0.34, p=0.05), sleep comfort: ES=0.60; p=0.03, ease of falling asleep: ES=0.70; p=0.01, ease of waking up: ES=0.87, p<0.01, and having enough sleep: ES=0.87, p<0.01) significantly decreased after home confinement. No differences were observed in HRV or quality of life variables (p>=0.13)., CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement has worsened the sleep quality, but not in cardiac autonomic control or quality of life, in people with MS.

Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio-A marker of COVID-19 pneumonia severity,Imran M.M.; Ahmad U.; Usman U.; Ali M.; Shaukat A.; Gul N. ,"Aim: To determine the efficacy of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in the South-Asian population. Method(s): This was a prospective, cross-sectional, analytic study conducted at HDU/ICU of District Headquarter Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan, from May through July 2020. Sixty-three eligible patients, admitted to the HDU/ICU, were prospectively enrolled in the study. Their NLR, C-reactive protein, serum albumin and serum fibrinogen were measured. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection, medication use and history of lung malignancy were retrieved from their medical history. Patients were categorised into either a general group (with mild COVID-19) or a heavy group (with moderate to severe COVID-19). Result(s): There were significant differences between the two groups in diabetes prevalence, NLR, C-reactive protein and serum albumin. NLR and C-reactive protein were positively correlated (P <.001, P =.04, respectively) whereas serum albumin was negatively correlated (P =.009) with severe COVID-19. NLR was found to be an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the heavy group (OR = 1.264, 95% CI: 1.046~1.526, P =.015). The calculated AUC using ROC for NLR was 0.831, with an optimal limit of 4.795, sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.75, which is highly suggestive of NLR being a marker for the early detection of deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection.

Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,Daaboul J.; Tamouza R.; Leboyer M. ,"Objective: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method(s): Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Result(s): As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion(s): In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated.

Fear of COVID-19 and stigmatization towards infected people among Jordanian people,Abuhammad S.; H Alzoubi K.; Khabour O. ,"Aim: This study aims to explore the prevalence rates of stigma and fear among people in Jordan during COVID-19 pandemic and to assess socio-demographic and personal factors contributing to the prevalence rates of fear and stigma among people in Jordan during COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Cross-sectional descriptive design was utilized to attain the study aim. An anonymous online survey targeting people of Jordan was used and distributed to adults in Arabic language. The survey included a previously validated fear scale. Stigma was measured using developed instrument by authors. Result(s): The prevalence of fear among study participants was 52%. In addition, the prevalence of stigma towards infected people and their contact was 64%. The predictors of stigma towards infected people with COVID-19 and their contact were income, living area and downloaded application to trace COVID-19 cases. Moreover the predictors of fear were income living area and downloaded application to trace COVID-19 cases (P <=.001). Conclusion(s): More than 50% of the respondents were afraid from COVID-19 and 64% had stigma towards infected people and their contact during the COVID-19 pandemic.

High-flow nasal cannulae for respiratory support in adult intensive care patients,Lewis S.R.; Baker P.E.; Parker R.; Smith A.F. ,"Background: High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing respiratory support for adults experiencing acute respiratory failure, or at risk of acute respiratory failure, in the intensive care unit (ICU). This is an update of an earlier version of the review. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy, or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), for respiratory support in adults in the ICU. Search Method(s): We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register (17 April 2020), clinical trial registers (6 April 2020) and conducted forward and backward citation searches. Selection Criteria: We included randomized controlled studies (RCTs) with a parallel-group or cross-over design comparing HFNC use versus other types of non-invasive respiratory support (standard oxygen therapy via nasal cannulae or mask; or NIV or NIPPV which included continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure) in adults admitted to the ICU. Data Collection and Analysis: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Main Result(s): We included 31 studies (22 parallel-group and nine cross-over designs) with 5136 participants; this update included 20 new studies. Twenty-one studies compared HFNC with standard oxygen therapy, and 13 compared HFNC with NIV or NIPPV; three studies included both comparisons. We found 51 ongoing studies (estimated 12,807 participants), and 19 studies awaiting classification for which we could not ascertain study eligibility information. In 18 studies, treatment was initiated after extubation. In the remaining studies, participants were not previously mechanically ventilated. HFNC versus standard oxygen therapy. HFNC may lead to less treatment failure as indicated by escalation to alternative types of oxygen therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.86; 15 studies, 3044 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC probably makes little or no difference in mortality when compared with standard oxygen therapy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11; 11 studies, 2673 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC probably results in little or no difference to cases of pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09; 4 studies, 1057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we were uncertain of its effect on nasal mucosa or skin trauma (RR 3.66, 95% CI 0.43 to 31.48; 2 studies, 617 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay according to the type of respiratory support used (MD 0.12 days, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.27; 7 studies, 1014 participants). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) within 24 hours of treatment (MD 10.34 mmHg, 95% CI -17.31 to 38; 5 studies, 600 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC made any difference to short-term comfort (MD 0.31, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.22; 4 studies, 662 participants, very low-certainty evidence), or to long-term comfort (MD 0.59, 95% CI -2.29 to 3.47; 2 studies, 445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). HFNC versus NIV or NIPPV. We found no evidence of a difference between groups in treatment failure when HFNC were used post-extubation or without prior use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence), or in-hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.31; 5 studies, 1758 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of using HFNC on incidence of pneumonia (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1750 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and HFNC may result in little or no difference to barotrauma (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.14; 1 study, 830 participants; low-certainty evidence). HFNC may make little or no difference to the length of ICU stay (MD -0.72 days, 95% CI -2.85 to 1.42; 2 studies, 246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The ratio of PaO2/FiO2 may be lower up to 24 hours with HFNC use (MD -58.10 mmHg, 95% CI -71.68 to -44.51; 3 studies, 1086 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether HFNC improved short-term comfort when measured using comfort scores (MD 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; 2 studies, 258 participants) and responses to questionnaires (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 168 participants); evidence for short-term comfort was very low certainty. No studies reported on nasal mucosa or skin trauma. Authors' conclusions: HFNC may lead to less treatment failure when compared to standard oxygen therapy, but probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure when compared to NIV or NIPPV. For most other review outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in effect. However, the evidence was often of low or very low certainty. We found a large number of ongoing studies; including these in future updates could increase the certainty or may alter the direction of these effects.Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Methodology: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Pir Abdul Qadir Shah Jeelani Institute Of Medical Sciences Gambat, Khairpur Mirs and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre between August 2019 and July 2020. All patients over 18 years of age were eligible to participate in the study. Patients with incomplete data or those who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the study. Mineral metabolism parameters including, serum calcium, Phosphorus, and intact iPTH (iPTH), levels were recorded for all patients. Patients were followed up till the start of August 2020 to record any cardiovascular event. Patients were sub stratified into two groups i.e. with or without a CV event. Result(s): The study reported that with the exception of serum calcium, both iPTH and serum phosphorus were significantly associated with occurrence of CV events. iPTH levels had a direct association with CV events with a mean iPTH of 157.34+/-106.95 pg/ml in patients with CV events versus 108.98+/-85.63 pg/ml in patients without any CV event (P=0.0005). The mean serum phosphorus for the group with CV event was 3.57+/-0.73 mg/dl which was significantly higher than those without CV events (P=0.03). Conclusion(s): The current study indicated that serum phosphorus and intact iPTH levels were significantly associated with CV events in patients with CKD.Copyright © 2020 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

Deletion in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in some of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome,Kumar B.K.; Rohit A.; Prithvisagar K.S.; Rai P.; Karunasagar I. ,"The envelope glycoprotein (E) is the smallest structural component of SARS-CoVs; plays an essential role in the viral replication starting from envelope formation to assembly. The in silico analysis of 2086 whole genome sequences from India performed in this study provides the first observation on the extensive deletion of amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in 34 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These amino acid deletions map to the homopentameric interface and PDZ binding motif (PBM) present in the C-terminal region of E protein as well as immediately after the reverse primer binding region as per Charite protocol in 26 of these genomes, hence, their detection through RT-qPCR may not be hampered and therefore E gene-based RT-qPCR would still detect these isolates. Eight genomes from the State of Odisha had deletion even in the primer binding site. It is possible that the deletions in the C-terminal region of E protein of these genomes are a result of adapting to a newer geographical area and host. The information on the clinical status was available only for 9 out of 34 cases and these were asymptomatic. However, further studies are indispensable to understand the functional consequences of amino acid deletion in the C terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein in the viral pathogenesis and host adaptation.Copyright © 2020",2021,/,Virus Research,291,"(Kumar, Prithvisagar, Rai, Karunasagar) Division of Infectious Diseases, Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, Nitte (Deemed to be University), Deralakatte, Mangaluru 575018, India(Rohit) Department of Microbiology, The Madras Medica",198222,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198222,2008563573,#92015,Kumar 2021,"",""

Method(s): We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. Result(s): The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI = 10.3-15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score. Conclusion(s): The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2021,/,Comprehensive Psychiatry,104,"(Garre-Olmo, Turro-Garriga, Marti-Lluch, Zacarias-Pons, Alves-Cabratosa, Vilalta-Franch, Ramos) Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Catalonia, Spain(Garre-Olmo, Turro-Garriga, Serrano-Sarbosa) Institut d'Assistencia Sanitaria, Catalonia, Spain(",152214,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214,2008562112,#92014,Garre-Olmo 2021,"",""
Case Report: Decompressive Craniectomy for COVID-19 Malignant Cerebral Artery Infarction. Is Surgery a Good Option?,Saez-Alegre M.; Garcia-Feijoo P.; Millan P.; Vivancos Sanchez C.; Rodriguez Dominguez V.; Garcia Nerin J.; Isla Guerrero A.; Gandia-Gonzalez M.L. ,"SARS-CoV2 infection can lead to a prothrombotic state. Large vessel occlusion, as well as malignant cerebral stroke have been described in COVID-19 patients. In the following months, given the increase in COVID-19 cases, an increase in malignant cerebral SARS-CoV2 associated strokes are expected. The baseline situation of the patients as well as the risk of evolution to a serious disease due to the virus, depict a unique scenario. Decompressive craniectomy is a life-saving procedure indicated in patients who suffer a malignant cerebral stroke; however, it is unclear whether the same eligibility criteria should be used for patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge seven cases of decompressive craniectomy and malignant cerebral stroke have been described to date. We report on a 39-year-old female with no major risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, apart from oral contraception, and mild COVID-19 symptoms who suffered from left hemispheric syndrome. The patient underwent endovascular treatment with stenting and afterward decompressive craniectomy due to a worsening neurological status with unilateral unreactive mydriasis. We present the case and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature related to the surgical treatment for COVID-19 associated malignant strokes, to establish whether the same eligibility criteria for non-COVID-19 associated strokes should be used. Eight patients, including our case, were surgically managed due to malignant cerebral stroke. Seven of these patients received decompressive craniectomy, and six of them met the eligibility criteria of the current stroke guidelines. The mortality rate was 33%, similar to that described in non-COVID-19 cases. Two patients had a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and both survived after decompressive craniectomy. Our results support that decompressive craniectomy, using the current stroke guidelines, should be considered an effective life-saving treatment for COVID-19-related malignant cerebral strokes.© Copyright © 2021 Saez-Alegre, Garcia-Feijoo, Millan, Vivancos Sanchez, Rodriguez Dominguez, Garcia Nerin, Isla Guerrero and Gandia-Gonzalez.",2021,/,Frontiers in Neurology,12,"(Saez-Alegre, Garcia-Feijoo, Vivancos Sanchez, Rodriguez Dominguez, Isla Guerrero, Gandia-Gonzalez) Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital La Paz Madrid, Madrid, Spain(Millan, Garcia Nerin) Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Hospital La Paz Madrid, Madr",632036,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.632036,634396745,#92023,Saez-Alegre 2021,"",""
Abdominal imaging findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a scoping review,Lui K.; Wilson M.P.; Low G. ,"Purpose: This scoping review evaluated the currently available data related to abdominal imaging in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science was performed from inception to July 15, 2020 using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The review included case reports and series discussing radiologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in abdominal imaging studies. Studies published from inception to March 31, 2020, were independently screened and reviewed by one author, and another author reviewed studies published after March 31 to July 15, 2020. Study screening and full-text review for publications before March 31, 2020, was performed by one author, and another author for publications after March 31 to July 15, 2020. Result(s): Thirty-six studies were included in qualitative synthesis. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms is roughly 18% and includes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Sixteen percent of COVID-19 cases may only present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Many patients presenting this way demonstrate evidence of COVID-19 incidentally through abdominal CT imaging at the lung bases. Studies published to date have also reported abdominal imaging findings including small and large bowel wall thickening, fluid-filled colon, pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum, intussusception, and ascites.

An online tool for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multi-center study,Song C.; Dong Z.; Gong H.; Liu X.-P.; Dong X.; Wang A.; Chen Y.; Song Q.; Hu W. ,"Purpose: During the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, oncologists face new challenges, and they need to adjust their cancer management strategies as soon as possible to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and tumor recurrence. However, data on cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains scarce. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study on 223 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 from 26 hospitals in Hubei, China. An individualized nomogram was constructed based on multivariate Cox analysis. Considering the convenience of the nomogram application, an online tool was also created. The predictive performance and clinical application of nomogram were verified by C-index, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Result(s): Among cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2, there were significant differences in clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors, and compared with patients with solid tumors including lung cancer, patients with hematological malignancies had a worse prognosis. Male, dyspnea, elevated PCT, increased heart rate, elevated D-dimers, and decreased platelets were risk factors for these patients. Furthermore, a good prediction performance of the online tool (dynamic nomogram: https://covid-19-prediction-tool.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/) was also fully demonstrated with the C-indexes of 0.841 (95% CI 0.782-0.900) in the development cohort and 0.780 (95% CI 0.678-0.882) in the validation cohort.

Toxic shock-like syndrome and COVID-19: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C),Greene A.G.; Saleh M.; Roseman E.; Sinert R. ,"Early reports of COVID-19 in pediatric populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department.

Depending on the specific setting, platelets may be either protective or pathogenic in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Their role in transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is less well defined; however, it has been hypothesized that recipient platelets and transfused platelets both play a pathogenic role in TRALI. Overall, despite conflicting findings, it appears that recipient platelets may play a pathogenic role in antibody-mediated TRALI; however, their contribution appears to be limited. It is imperative to first validate the involvement of recipient platelets by standardizing the animal models, methods, reagents, and readouts for lung injury and taking the animal housing environment into consideration. For the involvement of transfused platelets in TRALI, it appears that predominantly lipids such as ceramide in stored platelets are able to induce TRALI in animal models.

Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of Henry Ford Health System patients tested for COVID-19 between February 1 and April 18, 2020, treated with IS medication for IMID. Therapeutic class of IS medication, comorbidities, and demographic factors were combined into multivariate models to determine predictors of COVID-19 infection, admission, ventilation, and mortality. Result(s): Of 213 patients with IMID, 36.2% tested positive for COVID-19, and they had no greater odds of being hospitalized or requiring ventilation relative to the general population. No IS therapeutic worsened the course of disease after multivariate correction, although multidrug regimens and biologics predicted an increased and decreased rate of hospitalization, respectively, with the latter driven by tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. Limitation(s): A single-center study somewhat limits the generalization to community-based settings. Only patients tested for COVID-19 were analyzed. Conclusion(s): IS therapies for IMIDs are not associated with a significantly greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 or severe sequelae when controlling for other factors, and tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors may decrease the odds of severe infection.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.",2020,/,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,83,6,1696-1703,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.07.089,2007978177,#91877,Veenstra 2020,"",""
Proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine mRNA changes by real-time RT-PCR in patients with COVID-19 hospitalization in the ICU and people recovering from the disease,Jamaati H.; Pourabdollah M.; Tabarsi P.; Bahrami N.; Kazempour Dizaji M.; Askari E.; Farzanegan B.; Kiani A.; Abedini A.; Varahram M.; Daustany M.; Lookzadeh S.; Monjazebi F.; Mohamadnia A.; Velayati A.A. ,"BACKGROUND: A big difficulty in today's world, the Coronavirus has affected all industries and man's life. The disease is caused by a type of the Coronavirus known as COVID-19. A living activated complex, the body is capable of offering various reactions from the defense system against the virus. It should be noted that the most important reaction of the body to the virus involves an activation of the cytotoxic T-shaped cells, which can destroy infected cells as a result of their activity. A more accurate recognition of the cytokine storm mechanism in this disease can greatly contribute to its treatment. In the present study, we investigated the use of IL-10, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-alpha cytokines in patients with severe conditions at the Intensive Care Unit, and compared that to the real-time PCR method used to relieve the disease in patients. METHOD(S): We analyzed 30 blood samples from patients with severe conditions and 30 from cured ones using relative real-time RT-PCR, the results of which were subject to statistical analysis using SPSS 20. Moreover, groups of the same age were compared using the t-test. RESULT(S): The results showed that age in groups with severe symptoms that were hospitalized in the ICU and people recovering from the disease did not have a significant effect. There was an increase in the expression of IL-10, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-alpha cytokine genes in the peripheral blood of patients admitted to the ICU compared with those with recovered disease, and there was a significant difference (P value <0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The numerical value of fold change for the cytokine genes of IL-10, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-alpha in patients admitted to the ICU, compared to recovered patients are 1.28, 1.12, 1.30, 1.22 respectively.Copyright © 2020 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA Online version at http://www.minervamedica.it",2020,/,Minerva Pneumologica,59,4,70-75,,http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4954.20.01888-X,2011095136,#91872,Jamaati 2020,"",""
COVID-19 in an Asymptomatic Renal Transplant Recipient Employed in the Health Care Setting: A Case Report,Adnani H.; Khatri A.; Agrawal N.; Molmenti E.; Bhaskaran M. ,"During the ongoing pandemic, there have been varying presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, with the concern that patients who are immunosuppressed (due to underlying medical conditions and/or therapies) are at higher risk of severe disease. We report the case of an elderly renal transplant recipient working in a long-term health care facility who was being monitored by weekly surveillance testing and tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, despite having no clinical symptoms. He recovered with supportive care, despite being on multiple long-term immunosuppressant drugs and having multiple comorbidities. Additionally, it was found that he did not mount an antibody response, when he tested negative by serologic testing. Through this case, we wish to highlight the unique clinical scenario of asymptomatic patients who may have an underwhelming immune response to COVID-19, but may nevertheless be an important source of dissemination. We further discuss the probable mechanism of such asymptomatic presentations in immunosuppressed patients, while reinforcing the importance of self-isolation of COVID-19 patients (particularly in asymptomatic health care workers).Copyright © 2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

Method(s): We identified 197 patients with COVID-19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes. Result(s): Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre-existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44-11.51], p < 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03-0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36-0.49]).

Use of ivermectin as a potential chemoprophylaxis for covid-19 in egypt: A randomised clinical trial,Shoumann W.M.; Hegazy A.A.; Nafae R.M.; Ragab M.I.; Samra S.R.; AnasIbrahim D.; HAL-Mahrouky T.; Sileem A.E. ,"Introduction: The rate of secondary attacks of SARS-COV-2 is high among household close contacts. Social distancing, isolation and infection control measures are important for preventing exposure to infection, but insufficient. Aim(s): The study aimed to evaluate possible role of oral ivermectin as a chemoprophylaxis in asymptomatic family close contacts with COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective interventional randomised open label-controlled study was conducted (registered at clinicaltrials.gov; NCT04422561) during June and July 2020. Two arms were designed according to use of ivermectin. In ivermectin arm, contacts received ivermectin according to Body Weight (BW) on day of the diagnosis of their index case. The non-intervention group received no treatment. Both groups were followed-up for two weeks for development of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Result(s): Ivermectin group included 203 contacts (to 52 index cases) aged 39.75+/-14.94 years; 52.2% were males. Non-intervention group included 101 contacts (to a total of 24 index cases) aged 37.69+/-16.96 years, 49.5% were males. Fifteen contacts (7.4%) developed COVID-19 in the ivermectin arm compared to 59 (58.4%) in the non-intervention arm (p<0.001). The protection rate for ivermectin was more prominent in contacts aged less than 60-year-old (6.2% infected compared to 58.7% if no treatment). Ivermectin in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection had an OR of 12.533 and 11.445 (compared to nontreatment) in both univariate and multivariate models, respectively. Side effects of ivermectin were reported in 5.4%; they were mild.

Paediatric COVID-19: Milder Presentation-A Silver Lining in Dark Cloud,Ramteke S.; Tikkas R.; Goel M.; Mandraha S.; Shrivastava J. ,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinico-epidemiological profile of paediatric patients with Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection during the pandemic. METHOD(S): Clinico-epidemiological and laboratory profile of children between 1 month and 14years were studied between 15 May and 31 July 2020, who had positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULT(S): A total of 30 children with median age of 10.5years (8months to 14years) were included in the present study. Sixty percent were boys. Twenty-seven (90%) belonged to an urban area and all 30 children were from a containment area. All were belonging to Kuppuswamy upper lower and lower socioeconomic class. Twenty-one (70%) were asymptomatic. All children had a positive household contact. Symptomatic children had only mild symptoms of fever, dry cough and rhinitis. All were fully vaccinated as per age. Nine (30%) had anaemia. The mean leucocyte count was 7470+/-2427 (4300-14 100). Leucocytosis was seen in 3 (9%) children. C-reactive protein was found to be raised in only 4 (13%) children. We did not find alteration in sense of smell and taste. No mortality was reported. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 in paediatric patients is usually mild.

Community use of face masks against the spread of covid-19,Bubbico L.; Mastrangelo G.; Larese-Filon F.; Basso P.; Rigoli R.; Maurelli M.; Ferlito S.; Capelli M.; Gisabella C.; Javanbakht M.; Bellizzi S.; Cegolon L. ,"The role of face masks to prevent and control COVID-19 is critical, especially since asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can shed high loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding environment. In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of ""source control"" (for the benefits of the community) and ""physical protection"" (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Correctional and detention facilities are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks. We aimed to evaluate cohort-based testing among detained persons exposed to laboratory-confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in order to identify presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. METHOD(S): During 1-19 May 2020, 2 testing strategies were implemented in 12 tiers or housing units of the Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois. Detained persons were approached to participate in serial testing (n = 137) and offered tests at 3 time points over 14 days (day 1, days 3-5, and days 13-14). The second group was offered a single test and interview at the end of a 14-day quarantine period (day 14 group) (n = 87). RESULT(S): 224 detained persons were approached for participation and, of these, 194 (87%) participated in >=1 interview and 172 (77%) had >=1 test. Of the 172 tested, 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Inflammatory pathways and potential therapies for COVID-19: A mini review,Dabbish A.M.; Yonis N.; Salama M.; Essa M.M.; Qoronfleh M.W. ,"The public health crisis of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is alarming since January 2020. COVID-19 genome (SARS-CoV-2) is related to other highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus). Amino acid substitutions in some of SARS-CoV-2 proteins resulted in mutations proposing more virulent and contagious properties for this novel virus. Coronavirus penetrates the host cell via endocytosis and once infected, immune responses are triggered to fight against the pathogen. Innate immune response activates major transcription factors to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon response (T1INF) to induce antiviral immunity. While adaptive immunity initiates cascade of B-cells antibody mediated and T-cells cellular mediate immunities, several mechanisms are raised by SARS-CoV-2 to evade host immune response. Consequently, a surge of proinflammatory cytokines, known as cytokine storm (CS) are released. Failure to manage CS results in several pathological complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although researches have not discovered an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, recent therapeutic approaches recommending the use of anti-inflammatories in combination with antivirals and some repurposed drugs for COVID-19 patients. Future medications should be designed to target essential hallmarks in the CS to improve clinical outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,/,European Journal of Inflammation,19,"(Dabbish) Biotechnology Graduate Program, School of Science and Engineering, The American University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt(Yonis) Institute of Global Health and Human Ecology (IGHHE) Graduate Program, The American University in Cairo, New Cairo, Egyp",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20587392211002986,2010858795,#92110,Dabbish 2021,"",""
Methods to disinfect and decontaminate SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review of in vitro studies,Kwok C.S.; Dashti M.; Tafuro J.; Nasiri M.; Muntean E.-A.; Wong N.; Kemp T.; Hills G.; Mallen C.D. ,"Background: Cleaning is a major control component for outbreaks of infection. However, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there is limited specific guidance regarding the proper disinfection methods that should be used. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review of the literature on cleaning, disinfection or decontamination methods in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): A total of 27 studies were included, reporting a variety of methods with which the effectiveness of interventions were assessed. Virus was inoculated onto different types of material including masks, nasopharyngeal swabs, serum, laboratory plates and simulated saliva, tears or nasal fluid and then interventions were applied in an attempt to eliminate the virus including chemical, ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, and heat and humidity. At body temperature (37degreeC) there is evidence that the virus will not be detectable after 2 days but this can be reduced to non-detection at 30 min at 56degreeC, 15 min at 65degreeC and 2 min at 98degreeC. Different experimental methods testing UV light have shown that it can inactivate the virus. Light of 254-365 nm has been used, including simulated sunlight. Many chemical agents including bleach, hand sanitiser, hand wash, soap, ethanol, isopropanol, guandinium thiocynate/t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, formaldehyde, povidone-iodine, 0.05% chlorhexidine, 0.1% benzalkonium chloride, acidic electrolysed water, Clyraguard copper iodine complex and hydrogen peroxide vapour have been shown to disinfect SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion(s): Heating, UV light irradiation and chemicals can be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 but there is insufficient evidence to support one measure over others in clinical practice.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.",2021,/,Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease,8,"(Kwok, Tafuro) Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom(Dashti, Mallen) School of Medicine, Keele University, Keele, United Kingdom(Nasiri) School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Ki",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2049936121998548,2010818100,#92106,Kwok 2021,"",""
Injury Rates in Major League Baseball During the 2020 COVID-19 Season,Platt B.N.; Uhl T.L.; Sciascia A.D.; Zacharias A.J.; Lemaster N.G.; Stone A.V. ,"Background: The 2020 Major League Baseball (MLB) season was drastically altered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes included an extended layoff between March and July as well as a shortened preseason. Purpose/Hypothesis: To determine the incidence and epidemiology of MLB injuries in the abbreviated 2020 season compared with prior seasons. We hypothesized that there was an increase in the overall injury rate in the 2020 season compared with the 2018-2019 seasons and that it equally affected all body regions. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Method(s): The MLB transactions database was queried to find players who had been placed on the injury list between 2018 and 2020. Injuries were categorized into upper extremity, lower extremity, spine/core, and other injuries. Incidence per 1000 athlete-exposures was calculated for the prior 2 seasons (2018-2019) and for the 2020 season separately. Incidence for each category was also calculated separately for pitchers and fielders. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and confidence intervals were used to compare injury rates in 2018-2019 versus 2020. The z test for proportions was used to determine significant differences between injury incidences. Result(s): In 2020, the overall incidence rate per 1000 athlete-exposures was almost twice the rate compared with the 2 seasons before COVID-19 (8.66 vs 5.13; IRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.53-1.87]; P <.001). Injury incidence increased similarly in 2020 for both pitchers (IRR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.47-1.91]; P <.001) and fielders (IRR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.45-1.96]; P <.001). Increases in injury incidence were seen in the upper extremity, spine/core, and other injury categories; however, the incidence of the lower extremity did not change significantly. Conclusion(s): There was a significant increase in injury incidence for both pitchers and fielders in 2020. Injury rates increased in anatomic zones of the upper extremity and spine/core but were not significantly changed in the lower extremity. The overall increase in injury rate suggests that irregular or insufficient sport-specific preparation prior to the start of the season placed athletes at a greater risk of injury when play resumed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,/,Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine,9,3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2325967121999646,2010818089,#92105,Platt 2021,"",""

The greatest combat of the 21st century against a debilitating disease agent SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus discovered in Wuhan, China, December 2019, has piqued an unprecedented usage of bioinformatics tools in deciphering the molecular characterizations of infectious pathogens. With the viral genome data of SARS-COV-2 been made available barely weeks after the reported outbreak, bioinformatics platforms have become an all-time critical tool to gain time in the fight against the disease pandemic. Before the outbreak, different platforms have been developed to explore antigenic epitopes, predict peptide-protein docking and antibody structures, and simulate antigen-antibody reactions and lots more.

SARS-CoV-2 as Enteric Virus in Wastewater: Which Risk on the Environment and Human Behavior?,Sbaoui Y.; Bennis F.; Chegdani F. ,"Microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa are the cause of many waterborne human infections. These microbes are either naturally present in aquatic environments or transferred within them by fecal sources. They remain in these environments for varying lengths of time before contaminating a new host. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, some studies have reported the presence of viral nucleic acids in stool samples from COVID-19 patients, suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was thereby detected in the wastewater of symptomatic and asymptomatic people with a risk to human and environmental health.

Tobacco use and the risk of suffering from covid-1,Sugiyo D.; Limato R.; Handari S.D. ,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and is confirmed worldwide to cause a high mortality rates; as of the April 23, 2020, over 189,000 deaths have occurred in 2,700,800 COVID-19 cases. However, it appears that little consideration has been given to smokers and the users of tobacco-related products relative to the impact of the virus on that particular cohort of patients. AIM: The aim of the study was to commence a narrative review of research and academic articles of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence related to cigarette smoking and the consumption of tobacco-related products. METHOD(S): The study involved evidence-based publication searches on ProQuest and EBSCOhost databases informed by a number of keywords. The additional data were obtained from relevant journals searched manually, as well as following up references or primary articles. The search was conducted from April 23 to 24, 2020, adopting the use of several terms, such as ""tobacco use"" AND ""COVID"", ""tobacco use"" AND ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""smokers"" AND ""COVID"", ""cigarette"" AND ""SARS-CoV-2"", and ""tobacco use"" AND COVID-19 AND sars-cov-2. RESULT(S): Several studies (n = 8) confirmed that conventional smoking and electronic cigarette use correlated with the decline of the human immune system and the feasibility of infection. The second group of evidence (n = 9) explored higher Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 among smokers, as the binding sites of SARS-COV-2. CONCLUSION(S): Tobacco use among smokers and former smokers is significantly correlated to the decline in the status of the human immune system and worsen the disease prognosis. In addition, smoking status is associated with a greater likelihood of smokers being infected with SARS-COV-2; a condition that can further develop into coronavirus disease.Copyright © 2021 Dianita Sugiyo, Ralalicia Limato, Saskia Dyah Handari.",2021,/,Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,9,T4,111-117,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2021.5757,2006784412,#92097,Sugiyo 2021,"",""
Guidelines for clinical management of sars-cov-2 infection,Garcia-alvarez J.L.; Garcia-Vigil J.L. ,"In SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), the most common manifestations involve the upper airways; in complicated cases, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure and multiple organ failure occur, which require hospital treatment and ventilatory support with nasal cannula or mask and high flow oxygen, or orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. There are no specific antivirals, and thus management is symptomatic, as well as with antiplatelet drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole), low molecular weight heparin when there is hypercoagulability (increased D-dimer), dexamethasone when inflammation indicators are elevated; experimentally, under informed consent, antibiotics are used according to microbiological results, as well as interferon beta 1b, favipiravir, tocilizumab, ivermectin and immunoglobulin G.

Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older people,Soiza R.L.; Scicluna C.; Thomson E.C. ,"Several vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the cusp of regulatory approval. Their safety and efficacy in older people is critical to their success. Even though care home residents and older people are likely to be amongst the first to be vaccinated, these patient groups are usually excluded from clinical trials. Data from several Phase II trials have given cause for optimism, with strong antibody responses and reassuring safety profiles but, with the exception of AstraZeneca's vaccine, recruited few older people. Overall, the sparse data from Phase II trials suggest a reduction in both antibody responses and mild to moderate adverse events in well older people compared to younger participants. Many of the Phase III trials have made a conscious effort to recruit older people, and interim analyses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have led to press releases announcing high degrees of efficacy. However, older people with co-morbidities and frailty have once again been largely excluded and there are no published data on safety and efficacy in this group. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their carers and supervising health care professionals alike will need to make a decision on accepting vaccination based on limited evidence. Here we review the main candidate vaccines that may become available, with a focus on the evidence of safety and efficacy in older people.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 in a health workers population in Nouakchott-Mauritania,Salem M.L.O.; Sidiya M.A.M.M.; Eibih A.B.A.; Maouloud M.M.; Ngaide B.H.; Dedy L.; Hamza L.M.; Yacoub F. ,"The first outbreak of epidemic respiratory disease due to unknown etiology was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) firstly used the term ""new coronavirus 2019"" on December 29, 2019. This pandemic, which is currently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was subsequently called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all employees of the Nouakchott National Hospital Center (CHN). The study was conducted during the week 20/05/2020 to 27/05/2020. It involved 853 employees of all ranks (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, secretaries, security personnel, administrators...) of whom 504 were male and 331 were female, with a sex ratio of 1,52 with an average age of 39 years, ranging from 20 to 60 years. The screening for IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Biotime (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) immunochromatographic technique. Out of 835 employees included in our study, 14 were positive (1.67%) of whom 12 had IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 2 had isolated IgM. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in these 14 patients and was positive in six. While PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in particular rapid tests (RDTs) are a diagnostic complement to COVID-19. They have the advantage of being easy to realize, of being safe both in the laboratories and outside the laboratories. RDTs enabled us to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within CHN employees.

Incidence and predictors of peri-traumatic reactions in an Algerian population faced with COVID-19,Djillali S.; Ouandelous N.-N.; Zouani N.; Crettaz Von Roten F.; de Roten Y. ,"Objectives: This study explored two related questions: (1) the incidence of peri-traumatic distress and dissociation in a general Algerian population during the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic; (2) sociodemographic predictors of peri-traumatic reaction. The objective is to better understand the peri-traumatic experience in order to identify vulnerable people to whom psychological care could be offered. Material(s) and Method(s): An online descriptive survey containing three questionnaires, a demographic questionnaire, the questionnaire for peri-traumatic distress and the questionnaire for peri-traumatic dissociation experiences, was conducted using the snowball sampling technique to select 1374 Algerians. Result(s): The results of this survey indicate that 32.7 % of the participants present a peri-traumatic distress and 61.8 % of the participants present a significant level of peri-traumatic dissociation during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to confinement, stress, female gender, the origin of a particularly affected department, the average economic situation and a history of psychological problems are predictors of peri-traumatic distress. Conclusion(s): This study provides the first empirical data on the incidence of peri-traumatic reactions (distress and dissociation), as well as their predictors in an Algerian population during the initial phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. The Algerian population has experienced levels of distress in the low range of what has been described in the literature, while the dissociation shows that the majority of the population is affected. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the peri-traumatic reactions according to the two dimensions of distress and dissociation, and offering psychological care for the most vulnerable people, in order to prevent the risk of their possible chronicisation, and developing post-traumatic stress disorder in later periods.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",2021,/,Annales Medico-Psychologiques,,"(Djillali, Ouandelous, Zouani) Faculte des sciences Humaines et Sociales, departement de Psychologie, centre Psychologique Universitaire, universite Mouloud Mammeri de Tizi Ouzou, Tizi Ouzou, Algeria(de Roten) Departement de psychiatrie, Institut universi",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.03.006,2011409051,#91727,Djillali 2021,"",""

Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination,"Thompson, James; Wattam, Stephen","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present a detailed agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with $R_0 = 2.45$, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model results, on average, in only around 23% of the resident population infected. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are much less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns appear very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low levels, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population immune. When vaccinating in midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.",2021,,,,,,PPR303326,10.1101/2021.03.21.21254049,,#93097,Thompson 2021,"",""

All the samples were initially screened by the Ortho Total Ig test to confirm positivity and subsequently tested with 7 additional direct sandwich or indirect binding assays (Ortho, Roche, Abbott, Broad Institute) directed against a variety of antigen targets (S1, RBD, and NC), along with 2 neutralization assays (Broad Institute live virus PRNT and Vitalant Research Institute Pseudovirus RVPN). Results The direct detection assays (Ortho Total Ig total and Roche Total Ig) showed increasing levels of antibodies over the time period, in contrast to the indirect IgG assays that showed a decline. Neutralization assays also demonstrated declining responses; the VRI RVPN pseudovirus had a greater rate of decline than the Broad PRNT live virus assay. Discussion These data show that in addition to variable individual responses and associations with disease severity, the detection assay chosen contributes to the heterogeneous results in antibody stability over time. Depending on the scope of the research, one assay may be preferable over another. For serosurveillance studies, direct, double Ag-sandwich assays appear to be the best choice due to their stability; in particular, algorithms that include both S1 and NC based assays can help reduce the rate of false-positivity and discriminate between natural infection and vaccine-derived seroreactivity.",2021,,,,,,PPR303213,10.1101/2021.03.24.21254260,,#93081,ClaraDiGermanio 2021,"",""

The best diagnostic method and the ideal time of collection remains the subject of study. The gold standard for diagnosing COVID 19 is the RT PCR molecular test, usually using an oropharynx and nasopharynx swab. Its sensitivity is 70% and drops significantly after the second week of symptoms. Serological tests, in turn, have increased sensitivity after 14 days, and can contribute to the diagnosis when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected, even with negative RT PCR. Our study showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% of the serological test (ELISA method) for cases of viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, suggesting that this test could assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial changes that have not yet been etiologically clarified.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection with a GMR based LFIA system,Bayin Q.; Huang L.; Ren C.; Fu Y.; Ma X.; Guo J. ,"Since December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of deaths and seriously threatened the safety of human life; indeed, this situation is worsening and many people are infected with the new coronavirus every day. Therefore, it is very important to understand patients' degree of infection and infection history through antibody testing. Such information is useful also for the government and hospitals to formulate reasonable prevention policies and treatment plans. In this paper, we develop a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) method based on superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs) and a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensing system for the simultaneously quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG). A simple and time-effective co-precipitation method was utilized to prepare the SMNPs, which have good dispersibility and magnetic property, with an average diameter of 68 nm. The Internet of Medical Things-supported GMR could transmit medical data to a smartphone through the Bluetooth protocol, making patient information available for medical staff. The proposed GMR system, based on SMNP-supported LFIA, has an outstanding advantage in cost-effectiveness and time-efficiency, and is easy to operate. We believe that the suggested GMR based LFIA system will be very useful for medical staff to analyze and to preserve as a record of infection in COVID-19 patients.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 serological assays for enhanced case finding in a UK inpatient population,Pallett S.J.C.; Denny S.J.; Patel A.; Charani E.; Mughal N.; Stebbing J.; Davies G.W.; Moore L.S.P. ,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic. Case identification is currently made by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the acute phase and largely restricted to healthcare laboratories. Serological assays are emerging but independent validation is urgently required to assess their utility. We evaluated five different point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 antibody test kits against PCR, finding concordance across the assays (n=15). We subsequently tested 200 patients using the OrientGene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and find a sensitivity of 74% in the early infection period (day 5-9 post symptom onset), with 100% sensitivity not seen until day 13, demonstrating inferiority to PCR testing in the infectious period. Negative rate was 96%, but in validating the serological tests uncovered potential false-negatives from PCR testing late-presenting cases. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 37% in the general population precludes any use for general screening. Where a case definition is applied however, the PPV is substantially improved (95.4%), supporting use of serology testing in carefully targeted, high-risk populations. Larger studies in specific patient cohorts, including those with mild infection are urgently required to inform on the applicability of POC serological assays to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and improve case finding of patients that may experience late complications.",2021,/,Scientific reports,11,1,5860,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85247-w,634562910,#92913,Pallett 2021,"",""
Mass Screening Is Associated with Low Rates of Acute Kidney Injury among COVID-19 Patients in Hong Kong.,"Chan, Kam Wa; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Wu, Tak Chiu; Tso, Eugene Yuk-Keung; Lung, Kwok Cheung; Lam, Chung Man; Chan, Gary Chi-Wang; Wong, Sunny Sze-Ho; Yu, Kam Yan; Chan, Johnny Wai-Man; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai","INTRODUCTION: Renal involvement in COVID-19 is less well characterized in settings with vigilant public health surveillance, including mass screening and early hospitalization. We assessed kidney complications among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong, including the association with risk factors, length of hospitalization, critical presentation, and mortality., METHODS: Linked electronic records of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 5 major designated hospitals were extracted. Duplicated records due to interhospital transferal were removed. Primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary outcomes were AKI-associated mortality, incident renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care admission, prolonged hospitalization and disease course (defined as >90th percentile of hospitalization duration [35 days] and duration from symptom onset to discharge [43 days], respectively), and change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients were further stratified into being symptomatic or asymptomatic., RESULTS: Patients were characterized by young age (median: 38.4, IQR: 28.4-55.8 years) and short time (median: 5, IQR: 2-9 days) from symptom onset to admission. Among the 591 patients, 22 (3.72%) developed AKI and 4 (0.68%) required RRT. The median time from symptom onset to in-hospital AKI was 15 days. AKI increased the odds of prolonged hospitalization and disease course by 2.0- and 3.5-folds, respectively. Estimated GFR 24 weeks post-discharge reduced by 7.51 and 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus baseline (upon admission) in the AKI and non-AKI groups, respectively. The incidence of AKI was comparable between asymptomatic (4.8%, n = 3/62) and symptomatic (3.7%, n = 19/519) patients., CONCLUSION: The overall rate of AKI among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong is low, which could be attributable to a vigilant screening program and early hospitalization. Among patients who developed in-hospital AKI, the duration of hospitalization is prolonged and kidney function impairment can persist for up to 6 months post-discharge. Mass surveillance for COVID-19 is warranted in identifying asymptomatic subjects for earlier AKI management. Copyright © 2021 S.

An ever-increasing number of studies investigating the characteristics of the disease, day by day, is shedding light on a new feature of the virus with the hope that eventually these efforts lead to the proper treatment. SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral immune responses, but in addition may overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing uncontrolled inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19. This condition may lead to lymphopenia and lymphocyte dysfunction, which in turn, predispose patients to further infections, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, accurate knowledge in this issue is important to guide clinical management of the disease and the development of new therapeutic strategies in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a piece of valuable information about the alteration of each subtype of lymphocytes and important prognostic factors associated with these cells. Moreover, through discussing the lymphopenia pathophysiology and debating some of the most recent lymphocyte- or lymphopenia-related treatment strategies in COVID-19 patients, we tried to brightening the foreseeable future for COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease.

An overview of some potential immunotherapeutic options against COVID-19.,"Bayat, Maryam; Asemani, Yahya; Mohammadi, Mohammad Reza; Sanaei, Mahsa; Namvarpour, Mozhdeh; Eftekhari, Reyhaneh","After the advent of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in the late 2019, the resulting severe and pernicious syndrome (COVID-19) immediately was deployed all around the world. To date, despite relentless efforts to control the disease by drug repurposing, there is no approved specific therapy for COVID-19. Given the role of innate and acquired immune components in the control and elimination of viral infections and inflammatory mutilations during SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, immunotherapeutic strategies appear to be beneficent. Passive immunotherapies such as convalescent plasma, which has received much attention especially in severe cases, as well as suppressing inflammatory cytokines, interferon administration, inhibition of kinases and complement cascade, virus neutralization with key engineered products, cell-based therapies, immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs are among the key immunotherapeutic approaches to deal with COVID-19, which is discussed in this review. Also, details of leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates as the most potent immunotherapy have been provided. However, despite salient improvements, there is still a lack of completely assured vaccines for universal application. Therefore, adopting proper immunotherapies according to the cytokine pattern and involved immune responses, alongside engineered biologics specially ACE2-Fc to curb SARS-CoV2 infection until achieving a tailored vaccine is probably the best strategy to better manage this pandemic. Therefore, gaining knowledge about the mechanism of action, potential targets, as well as the effectiveness of immune-based approaches to confront COVID-19 in the form of a well-ordered review study is highly momentous.

Impact of outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions on the COVID-19 transmission in the western region of Saudi Arabia.,"Habeebullah, Turki M; Abd El-Rahim, Ibrahim H A; Morsy, Essam A","Meteorological conditions may influence the incidence of many infectious diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, air-borne, emerging, viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic affected more than 210 countries and territories worldwide including Saudi Arabia. There are contradictory research papers about the correlation between meteorological parameters and incidence of COVID-19 in some countries worldwide. The current study investigates the impact of outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions on the daily recorded COVID-19 cases in western region (Makkah and Madinah cities) of Saudi Arabia over a period of 8 months from March to October 2020. Reports of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the webpage of Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) were used. Considering, the incubation period of COVID-19 which ranged from 2 to 14 days, the relationships between daily COVID-19 cases and outdoor meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) using a lag time of 10 days are investigated. The results showed that the highest daily COVID-19 cases in Makkah and Madinah were reported during the hottest months of the year (April-July 2020) when outdoor temperature ranged from 26.51 to 40.71 degreeC in Makkah and of 23.89-41.20 degreeC in Madinah, respectively. Partial negative correlation was detected between outdoor relative humidity and daily recorded COVID-19 cases. No obvious correlation could be demonstrated between wind speed and daily COVID-19 cases. This indicated that most of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the cool, air-conditioned, dry, and bad-ventilated indoor environment in the investigated cities. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the correlation between both outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. These findings would be also a useful supplement to assist the local healthcare policymakers to implement and apply a specific preventive measures and education programs for controlling of COVID-19 transmission.

We hypothesise that immune responses at symptom onset would correlate with outcomes. Method(s): Participants from the London area are referred to INSTINCT study by general practitioners as suspected, or Public Health England as laboratory-confirmed, cases (ethical review details: IRAS 282820, approved 24.04.2020). Households are visited the day after identification and again on days 7, 15 and 28. Clinical and exposure questionnaires, samples of environment (surface swabs and air); oropharynx (swabs); nasal mucosa (synthetic absorptive matrix) and blood, and daily symptom diaries are collected. Samples are analysed by PCR, serology, 20-plex cytokine assay and flow cytometry in institutional laboratories. Result(s): The index case was the first SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive recruit of INSTINCT, confirmed on oropharyngeal swab 5 days after symptom onset. Contacts 1 and 2, the spouse and daughter, became symptomatic 2 days after the index case and were confirmed PCR-positive 3 days after symptom onset. The three PCR-positive individuals seroconverted during follow-up. Contact 3, the son, remained asymptomatic, PCR-and serology-negative throughout (figure 1a-b). None required hospitalisation. Swabs of the kettle and fridge handles were positive for virus, while other household surfaces and air samples were negative. Induction, peak and decline of interferon-l-1 and IP-10 levels were captured in nasal mucosa, with lower serum levels (figures 1c-f). Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate the ability of the INSTINCT household contact study to capture early immune responses in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, not captured by COVID-19 hospital cohort studies.

Development of a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing pathway using dried blood spot specimens,Moat S.J.; Zelek W.M.; Carne E.; Ponsford M.J.; Bramhall K.; Jones S.; El-Shanawany T.; Wise M.P.; Thomas A.; George C.; Fegan C.; Steven R.; Webb R.; Weeks I.; Morgan B.P.; Jolles S. ,"Background: Serological assays for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have roles in seroepidemiology, convalescent plasma-testing, antibody durability and vaccine studies. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 serology is performed using serum/plasma collected by venepuncture. Dried blood spot (DBS) testing offers significant advantages as it is minimally invasive, avoids venepuncture with specimens being mailed to the laboratory. Method(s): A pathway utilizing a newborn screening laboratory infrastructure was developed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in DBS specimens. Paired plasma and DBS specimens from SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive and -negative subjects and polymerase chain reaction positive subjects were tested. DBS specimen stability, effect of blood volume and punch location were also evaluated. Result(s): DBS specimens from antibody-negative (n = 85) and -positive (n = 35) subjects and polymerase chain reaction positive subjects (n = 11) had a mean (SD; range) optical density (OD) of 0.14 (0.046; 0.03-0.27), 0.98 (0.41; 0.31-1.64) and 1.12 (0.37; 0.49-1.54), respectively. An action value OD >0.28 correctly assigned all cases. The weighted Deming regression for comparison of the DBS and the plasma assay yielded: y = 0.004041 + 1.005x, r = 0.991, Sy/x 0.171, n = 82. Extraction efficiency of antibodies from DBS specimens was >99%. DBS specimens were stable for at least 28 days at ambient room temperature and humidity. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 IgG receptor-binding domain antibodies can be reliably detected in DBS specimens.

"Single-component, self-assembling, protein nanoparticles presenting the receptor binding domain and stabilized spike as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.","He, Linling; Lin, Xiaohe; Wang, Ying; Abraham, Ciril; Sou, Cindy; Ngo, Timothy; Zhang, Yi; Wilson, Ian A; Zhu, Jiang","Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides an effective tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we combined antigen optimization and nanoparticle display to develop vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. We first displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on three self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. We then identified heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in S2 as the cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2GDELTAHR2), and displayed S2GDELTAHR2 on SApNPs. An antibody column specific for the RBD enabled tag-free vaccine purification. In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P). S2GDELTAHR2 elicited twofold higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2GDELTAHR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The S2GDELTAHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T cell immunity, thereby providing a promising vaccine candidate.

The case for lowered positivity threshold for COVID-19 antibody screening tests,Taubel J.; Cole S.; Camilleri D.; Spencer C.; Freier A.; Lorch U. ,"Introduction/background &aims: In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as the causative agent for COVID-19. To estimate the effectiveness of vaccines in development, a robust mechanism is required to understand the acquired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and how this may change over time. The Abbott Laboratories (Illinois, USA) chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) works by binding to SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in a patient blood sample.1 This luminescence is directly proportional to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, and the strength of the luminescence is quantified by signal/cut-off (S/CO) units. The Abbott CMIA is currently intended as a qualitative assay, with measured values above 1.4 S/CO units reported as SARS-CoV-2 positive, and those below being reported as SARS-CoV-2 negative. Method/summary of work: We used the Abbott CMIA in line with the manufacturer's instructions on venous blood from 18 individuals, within the age range 18-65, confirmed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection (by PCR and membrane immunoassay). Results/discussion: Our data showed that 14 data points taken from four individuals, which were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and by membrane immunoassay, had S/CO values below 1.4. This accounts for 35% of our collected data points, and 22% of individual tested. According to the manufacturer guidelines, these patients would be declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Conclusion(s): To conclude, the Abbott CMIA positive infection cutoff should be carefully re-evaluated and revised. It is of key importance to accurately determine whether a patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Even cases diagnosed as asymptomatic or mild have been associated with deleterious long-term effects.2,3 Therefore, false negatives of this nature present a danger and act counter to the purpose of antibody testing. One solution may be to adopt a protocol in which patient samples are tested multiple times using at least two different testing methods.",2021,/,British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,87,3,1618-1619,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14639,634524928,#91761,Taubel 2021,"",""

However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting between the two groups. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that abdominal pain could be characteristic of severe COVID-19 infections.

"The influence of urban, socio-economic, and eco-environmental aspects on COVID-19 cases, deaths and mortality: a multi-city case in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil.","Viezzer, Jennifer; Biondi, Daniela","Urban, socio-economic and eco-environmental influences on people's health are widely studied and well-known. Their relation to COVID-19, however, is still a novel research topic. Thus, we investigated if COVID-19 parameters are higher in cities with higher urbanization, worst socio-economic conditions, and less vegetation cover, considering 3,052 municipalities in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Brazil is the second country most affected by COVID-19, and the Atlantic Forest is its most urbanized, populous, and deforested region. Indexes were created through multivariate principal components analysis using secondary official data: population, demographic density, absolute built area, and relative built area as urbanization parameters; average per capita income, relative people vulnerable to poverty, illiteracy rate of the population aged 18 or over, and human development index (HDI) as socio-economic parameters; and absolute and relative vegetation cover, absolute and relative forest cover as eco-environmental parameters. These indexes were correlated with absolute and relative confirmed COVID-19 cases, absolute and relative confirmed deaths, and mortality rate via Spearman's and Kendall's coefficients. Strong correlations (>0.50) were found between COVID-19 and urbanization.

The object of this study is to understand the spatially varying associations between socioeconomic disadvantages and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New Mexico at the ZIP code level., METHODS: We constructed ZIP code-level data (n=372) using the 2014-2018 American Community Survey and COVID-19 data from the New Mexico Department of Health (as of 24 May 2020). The log-linear Poisson and geographically weighted Poisson regression are applied to model the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (total population as the offset) in a ZIP code., RESULTS: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a ZIP code is positively associated with socioeconomic disadvantages-specifically, the high levels of concentrated disadvantage and income inequality. It is also positively associated with the percentage of American Indian and Alaskan Native populations, net of other potential confounders at the ZIP code level. Importantly, these associations are spatially varying in that some ZIP codes suffer more from concentrated disadvantage than others., CONCLUSIONS: Additional attention for COVID-19 mitigation effort should focus on areas with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage, income inequality, and higher percentage of American Indian and Alaska Native populations as these areas have higher incidence of COVID-19.

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 on the level of frailty, physical, and cognitive performance in nursing home residents., DESIGN: Nested case-control study., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included nursing home residents who were infected with COVID-19 (case group, n = 76), matched by age to a control group (n = 76)., METHODS: Participants' sociodemographic and medical data were collected, and they were also assessed for physical function (handgrip and walking speed), cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination) and frailty (Frail-NH scale) before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (October to December 2019, pre-COVID-19) and after (June to July 2020, post-COVID-19). COVID-19 symptoms and clinical course were recorded for the cases., RESULTS: Between the pre- and post-COVID-19 assessments, we found a 19% greater deterioration in handgrip, a 22% greater increase in walking speed, and a 21% greater increase in Frail-NH scores in cases compared with controls. In both cases and controls, on the other hand, there was a significant 10% decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination scores over the study period.

Interferon system deficiencies exacerbating severe pandemic virus infections.,"Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G","Pandemics are caused by novel pathogens to which pre-existing antibody immunity is lacking.

An emerging concept is that genetic and non-genetic deficiencies in interferon system components lead to uncontrolled virus replication and severe illness in a subset of people. Intriguingly, new findings suggest that individuals with autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral function of interferon are at increased risk of severe COVID-19.

Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are attenuated in patients with IBD treated with infliximab.,"Kennedy, Nicholas A; Goodhand, James R; Bewshea, Claire; Nice, Rachel; Chee, Desmond; Lin, Simeng; Chanchlani, Neil; Butterworth, Jeffrey; Cooney, Rachel; Croft, Nicholas M; Hart, Ailsa L; Irving, Peter M; Kok, Klaartje B; Lamb, Christopher A; Limdi, Jimmy K; Macdonald, Jonathan; McGovern, Dermot Pb; Mehta, Shameer J; Murray, Charles D; Patel, Kamal V; Pollok, Richard Cg; Raine, Timothy; Russell, Richard K; Selinger, Christian P; Smith, Philip J; Bowden, Jack; McDonald, Timothy J; Lees, Charlie W; Sebastian, Shaji; Powell, Nicholas; Ahmad, Tariq; Contributors to the CLARITY IBD study","OBJECTIVE: Antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs impair protective immunity following pneumococcal, influenza and viral hepatitis vaccination and increase the risk of serious respiratory infections. We sought to determine whether infliximab-treated patients with IBD have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections., DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin alpha4beta7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020., RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2-5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2-76.1), p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is associated with attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were further blunted by immunomodulators used as concomitant therapy. Impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection might have important implications for global public health policy and individual anti-TNF-treated patients.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody in serum or plasma samples was captured by protein G-coated microtiter plate and detected using the crude cell lysates expressing Nanoluc luciferase (Nluc) enzyme fused with SARS-CoV-2 NP. After the addition of furimazine substrate, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP IgG antibody were quantitatively measured as luciferase light units. As expected, SARS-CoV-2 NP showed cross-reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV NP, but not MERS-CoV NP-specific monoclonal antibodies or the monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV Spike protein. LISA for detecting murine monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP showed a low limit of detection of 0.4 pg/mul and linear detection range from 0.4 pg/mul to 75 pg/mul.

Vaccines are being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbors 9 amino acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light-chain contacts with residue 501.

Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination: A method comparison of two different commercially available serological assays from the same manufacturer.,"Mueller, Thomas","BACKGROUND: We compared two serological assays from Roche Diagnostics in individuals with and without COVID-19 vaccination, namely the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (detecting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (detecting antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays., RESULTS: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection., CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine.

Risk factors and frequency of COVID-19 among healthcare workers at a tertiary care centre in India: a case-control study.,"Dev, Nishanth; Meena, Ramesh Chand; Gupta, D K; Gupta, Nitesh; Sankar, Jhuma","BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors and frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs., METHODS: We conducted this retrospective case-control study of 3100 HCWs between May and July 2020. HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were the cases (n=506) and those negative for SARS-CoV-2 were the controls (n=253). Univariate analysis was followed by multivariate analysis of key demographic, clinical and infection control variables., RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 16.32% of HCWs. Nearly 45% of infected HCWs were asymptomatic. The proportions of sanitation workers (24% vs 8%; p<0.0001) and technicians (10% vs 4%; p=0.0002) were higher and that of doctors was lower among cases as compared with controls (23% vs 43%; p<0.0001). On univariate analysis, the type of HCW, smoking, lack of training, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use and taking no or fewer doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be significant. On multivariate analysis, the type of HCW (risk ratio [RR] 1.67 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.34 to 2.08], p<0.0001), inappropriate PPE use (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.89], p=0.01) and taking fewer doses of HCQ (RR 0.92 [95% CI 0.86 to 0.99], p=0.03) were significant., CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 16% among HCWs.

Immunogenicity and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions and immunosuppressive therapy in a monocentric cohort.,"Geisen, Ulf M; Berner, Dennis K; Tran, Florian; Sumbul, Melike; Vullriede, Lena; Ciripoi, Maria; Reid, Hayley M; Schaffarzyk, Annika; Longardt, Ann C; Franzenburg, Jeanette; Hoff, Paula; Schirmer, Jan H; Zeuner, Rainald; Friedrichs, Anette; Steinbach, Andrea; Knies, Christine; Markewitz, Robert Dh; Morrison, Peter J; Gerdes, Sascha; Schreiber, Stefan; Hoyer, Bimba F","INTRODUCTION: In light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, protecting vulnerable groups has become a high priority. Persons at risk of severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine technology leading to increased insecurity especially in patients with CID., OBJECTIVE: Here we present for the first time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared with healthy controls., METHODS: 42 healthy controls and 26 patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs 50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by ELISA before initial vaccination and 7 days after secondary vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed prior to and 7 days after both vaccinations., RESULTS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL +/-1218 vs 2685+/-1102). Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease flare., CONCLUSION: We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without considerable side effects or induction of disease flares. Despite the small size of this cohort, we were able to demonstrate the efficiency and safety of mRNA vaccines in our cohort. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak and determined it a global pandemic. The current pandemic has infected nearly 100 million people and killed over 2 million. The current COVID-19 pandemic is smashing every public health barrier, guardrail and safety measure in underdeveloped and the most developed countries alike with peaks and troughs across time. Greatly impacted are those regions experiencing conflict and war. Morbidity and mortality increase logarithmically for those communities at risk and that lack the ability to promote basic preventative measures. As states around the globe struggle to unify responses, make gains on preparedness levels, identify and symptomatically treat positive cases and labs across the globe frantically rollout various vaccines and effective surveillance and therapeutic mechanisms. The incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 may continue to increase globally as no unified disaster response is manifested and disinformation spreads. During this failure in response, virus variants are erupting at a dizzying pace. Ungoverned spaces where non-state actors predominate and active war zones may become the next epicenter for COVID-19 fatality rates.As the incidence rates continue to rise, hospitals in North America and Europe exceed surge capacity and immunity post infection struggles to be adequately described. The global threat in previously high-quality, robust infrastructure healthcare systems in the most developed economies are failing the challenge posed by COVID-19; how will less developed economies and those healthcare infrastructures that are destroyed by war and conflict until adequate vaccines penetrance in these communities or adequate treatment are established? Ukraine and other states in the Black Sea Region are under threat and are exposed to armed Russian aggression against territorial sovereignty daily. Ukraine, where Russia has been waging war since 2014, faces this specific dual threat: disaster response to violence and a deadly infectious disease. In order to best serve biosurveillance, aid in pandemic disaster response and bolster health security in Europe, across the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) and Black Sea regions, increased NATO integration, across Ukraine's disaster response structures within the Ministries of Health, Defense and Interior must be reenforced and expanded in order to mitigate the COVID-19 disaster.",2021,/,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,,101297401,1-20,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.88,33762057,#91269,Quinn 2021,"",""
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination modelling for safe surgery to save lives: data from an international prospective cohort study.,"COVIDSurg Collaborative, GlobalSurg Collaborative","BACKGROUND: Preoperative SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could support safer elective surgery. Vaccine numbers are limited so this study aimed to inform their prioritization by modelling., METHODS: The primary outcome was the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one COVID-19-related death in 1 year. NNVs were based on postoperative SARS-CoV-2 rates and mortality in an international cohort study (surgical patients), and community SARS-CoV-2 incidence and case fatality data (general population). NNV estimates were stratified by age (18-49, 50-69, 70 or more years) and type of surgery. Best- and worst-case scenarios were used to describe uncertainty., RESULTS: NNVs were more favourable in surgical patients than the general population. The most favourable NNVs were in patients aged 70 years or more needing cancer surgery (351; best case 196, worst case 816) or non-cancer surgery (733; best case 407, worst case 1664). Both exceeded the NNV in the general population (1840; best case 1196, worst case 3066). NNVs for surgical patients remained favourable at a range of SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates in sensitivity analysis modelling. Globally, prioritizing preoperative vaccination of patients needing elective surgery ahead of the general population could prevent an additional 58 687 (best case 115 007, worst case 20 177) COVID-19-related deaths in 1 year., CONCLUSION: As global roll out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination proceeds, patients needing elective surgery should be prioritized ahead of the general population.

Interim estimates in null models of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.,"Lisewski, Andreas Martin","Recently released interim numbers from advanced vaccine candidate clinical trials suggest that a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) above 90% is achievable. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is highly heterogeneous and exhibits localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, this characteristic burstiness in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with burstiness that over longer times converge to exactly zero VE, but that for interim times frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of a RNA based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and in reported cases.

The University of Arizona (UArizona) utilized WBE paired with clinical testing as a surveillance tool to monitor the UArizona community for SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time, as students re-entered campus in the fall. Positive detection of virus RNA in wastewater lead to selected clinical testing, identification, and isolation of three infected individuals (one symptomatic and two asymptomatic) that averted potential disease transmission. This case study demonstrated the value of WBE as a tool to efficiently utilize resources for COVID-19 prevention and response. Thus, WBE coupled with targeted clinical testing was further conducted on 13 dorms during the course of the Fall semester (Table 3). In total, 91 wastewater samples resulted in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that successfully provided an early-warning for at least a single new reported case of infection (positive clinical test) among the residents living in the dorm. Overall, WBE proved to be an accurate diagnostic for new cases of COVID-19 with an 82.0% positive predictive value and an 88.9% negative predictive value. Increases in positive wastewater samples and clinical tests were noted following holiday-related activities. However, shelter-in-place policies proved to be effective in reducing the number of daily reported positive wastewater and clinical tests.

Understanding their clinical characteristics/ infection status may provide prognostic information and facilitate decisions about management., METHODS: A pediatric-specific dermatology registry was created by the Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) and Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) and was managed by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using REDCap., RESULTS: Data from 378 children 0-18 years entered into the registry between April 13 and July 17, 2020 were analyzed. Data were drawn from a standardized questionnaire completed by clinicians which asked for demographics, description of acral lesions, symptoms before and after acral changes, COVID-19 positive contacts, treatment, duration of skin changes, laboratory testing including SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing, as well as histopathology. 229 (60.6%) were male with mean age of 13.0 years (+/- 3.6 years). Six (1.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Pedal lesions (often with pruritus and/or pain) were present in 96%. 30% (114/378) had COVID-19 symptoms during the 30 days prior to presentation. Most (69%) had no other symptoms and an uneventful course with complete recovery., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with acral pernio-like changes were healthy and all recovered with no short-term sequelae. We believe these acral changes are not just a temporal epiphenomenon of shelter in place during the spring months of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be a late phase reaction that needs further study.

Keeping up with COVID: identification of New Zealand's earliest known cluster of COVID-19 cases.,"Becker, Elizabeth; Vipond, Richard; Mansell, Chris","We report the earliest known cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection so far reported, which occurred in New Zealand in late February 2020. The cluster includes one confirmed and five probable cases. The cluster was identified while investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020. The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection. Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a COVID-19 like illness in February 2020. Combined case histories and investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February. Case investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected. A weak positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of infectivity.",2021,/,The New Zealand medical journal,134,1531,83-85,,,33767480,#91069,Becker 2021,"",""

The aim of this study was to describe the main epidemiological findings of a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in March 2020 at a nursing home for elderly in Granada. Risk factors associated with the spread of the virus in the center were investigated., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, collecting the most relevant clinical and epidemiological findings, occurred during the outbreak follow-up period (from 03/13/2020 to 06/20/2020). The association between the residents' health conditions (underlying diseases, level of physical dependence, level of cognitive impairment) and the risk of infection was estimated using multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: 52 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among the residents and 50 cases among the employees of the nursing home. The epidemic curve was characteristic of a person to person transmission. Among residents with a higher level of physical dependence, according to the Barthel index score, a higher incidence of infection was detected, adjusting for age, sex and health conditions. At 55 days of exposure, moderately (RR 2.82), severely (RR 4.71) and completely (RR 3.49) dependent residents had between 2-4 times greater risk of infection than the minimally dependent residents (p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic curve supports the hypothesis of a cross-transmission of infections between residents and staff members of the nursing home.

Elevated IL-6 levels are also observed in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Our study aimed to describe the association between circulating IL-6 levels and MAFLD at hospital admission with risk of severe COVID-19., Methods: A total of 167 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three Chinese hospitals were enrolled. Circulating levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma were measured at admission. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography. Forty-six patients were diagnosed as MAFLD., Results: Patients with MAFLD (n = 46) had higher serum IL-6 levels (median 7.1 [interquartile range, 4.3-20.0] vs. 4.8 [2.6-11.6] pg/mL, p = 0.030) compared to their counterparts without MAFLD (n = 121). After adjustment for age and sex, patients with MAFLD had a ~2.6-fold higher risk of having severe COVID-19 than those without MAFLD. After adjustment for age, sex and metabolic co-morbidities, increased serum IL-6 levels remained associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19, especially among infected patients with MAFLD (adjusted-odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23; p = 0.002).

Clinical information, biochemical parameters and Cp values were collected in an anonymized database and variables were analyzed with SPSS v25.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). No-survivors were significantly older (>65 years old) than survivors (p=0.007). A higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in patients who died than in those who survived was found (p=0.002). Statistically significant differences were obtained comparing RT-PCR Cp values for the E-gene of patients who died and those who survived, being lower (<=28) those of patients who died (p=0.004). No-survivors had significantly higher levels of CRP (>100) (p=0.007). E-gene Cp values <=28, which correlate with a high number of copies of SARS-CoV-2, as well as several demographical and biochemical parameters (Age above 65 years old, CRP levels >100 mg/L or cardiovascular comorbidities) could be useful markers of death risk in these patients.

Magnetic graphene quantum dots facilitate closed-tube one-step detection of SARS-CoV-2 with ultra-low field NMR relaxometry.,"Li, Yongqiang; Ma, Peixiang; Tao, Quan; Krause, Hans-Joachim; Yang, Siwei; Ding, Guqiao; Dong, Hui; Xie, Xiaoming","The rapid and sensitive diagnosis of the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the crucial issues at the outbreak of the ongoing global pandemic that has no valid cure. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 antibody conjugated magnetic graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-based magnetic relaxation switch (MRSw) that specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV-2. The probe of MRSw can be directly mixed with the test sample in a fully sealed vial without sample pretreatment, which largely reduces the testers' risk of infection during the operation. The closed-tube one-step strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 is developed with home-made ultra-low field nuclear magnetic resonance (ULF NMR) relaxometry working at 118 muT. The magnetic GQDs-based probe shows ultra-high sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to its high magnetic relaxivity, and the limit of detection is optimized to 248 Particles mL-1. Meanwhile, the detection time in ULF NMR system is only 2 min, which can significantly improve the efficiency of detection. In short, the magnetic GQDs-based MRSw coupled with ULF NMR can realize a rapid, safe, and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

If so, out-of-hospital SpO2 could be useful for initial triage., Methods: A population-based longitudinal study of adult patients transported by EMS to emergency departments (ED) between March 5 and April 30, 2020 (the NYC COVID-19 peak period). Inclusion required EMS prehospital SpO2 measurement while breathing room air, transport to emergency department, and a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Multivariable logistic regression modeled mortality as a function of prehospital SpO2, controlling for covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities). A competing risk model also was performed to estimate the absolute risks of out-of-hospital SpO2 on the cumulative incidence of being discharged from the hospital alive., Results: In 1673 patients, out-of-hospital SpO2 and age were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and length of stay, after controlling for the competing risk of death. Among patients >=66 years old, the probability of death was 26% with an out-of-hospital SpO2 >90% versus 54% with an out-of-hospital SpO2 <=90%. Among patients <66 years old, the probability of death was 11.5% with an out-of-hospital SpO2 >90% versus 31% with an out-of-hospital SpO2 <= 90%. An out-of-hospital SpO2 level <=90% was associated with over 50% decreased likelihood of being discharged alive, regardless of age., Conclusions: Out-of-hospital SpO2 and age predicted in-hospital mortality and length of stay: An out-of-hospital SpO2 <=90% strongly supports a triage decision for immediate hospital admission. For out-of-hospital SpO2 >90%, the decision to admit depends on multiple factors, including age, resource availability (outpatient vs inpatient), and the potential impact of new treatments.

MXene-Graphene Field-Effect Transistor Sensing of Influenza Virus and SARS-CoV-2.,"Li, Yanxiao; Peng, Zhekun; Holl, Natalie J; Hassan, Md Rifat; Pappas, John M; Wei, Congjie; Izadi, Omid Hoseini; Wang, Yang; Dong, Xiangyang; Wang, Cheng; Huang, Yue-Wern; Kim, DongHyun; Wu, Chenglin","An MXene-graphene field-effect transistor (FET) sensor for both influenza virus and 2019-nCoV sensing was developed and characterized. The developed sensor combines the high chemical sensitivity of MXene and the continuity of large-area high-quality graphene to form an ultra-sensitive virus-sensing transduction material (VSTM). Through polymer linking, we are able to utilize antibody-antigen binding to achieve electrochemical signal transduction when viruses are deposited onto the VSTM surface. The MXene-graphene VSTM was integrated into a microfluidic channel that can directly receive viruses in solution. The developed sensor was tested with various concentrations of antigens from two viruses: inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus ranging from 125 to 250,000 copies/mL and a recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein ranging from 1 fg/mL to 10 pg/mL. The average response time was about ~50 ms, which is significantly faster than the existing real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method (>3 h). The low limit of detection (125 copies/mL for the influenza virus and 1 fg/mL for the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein) has demonstrated the sensitivity of the MXene-graphene VSTM on the FET platform to virus sensing. Especially, the high signal-to-viral load ratio (~10% change in source-drain current and gate voltage) also demonstrates the ultra-sensitivity of the developed MXene-graphene FET sensor. In addition, the specificity of the sensor was also demonstrated by depositing the inactivated influenza A (H1N1) HA virus and the recombinant 2019-nCoV spike protein onto microfluidic channels with opposite antibodies, producing signal differences that are about 10 times lower. Thus, we have successfully fabricated a relatively low-cost, ultrasensitive, fast-responding, and specific inactivated influenza A (H1N1) and 2019-nCoV sensor with the MXene-graphene VSTM.

Evaluation of flavonoids as 2019-nCoV cell entry inhibitor through molecular docking and pharmacological analysis.,"Bhowmik, Deep; Nandi, Rajat; Prakash, Amresh; Kumar, Diwakar","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is being rapidly spread by the extremely spreadable and pathogenic 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2. Pandemic incidence of COVID-19 has created a severe threat to global public health, necessitating the development of effective drugs or inhibitors or therapeutics agents against SARS-CoV-2. Spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in entering viruses into the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), and this specific interaction represents a promising drug target for the identification of potential drugs. This study aimed at the receptor-binding domain of S protein (RBD of nCoV-SP) and the ACE-2 receptor as a promising target for developing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Over 100 different flavonoids with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties from different literatures were taken as a ligand or inhibitor for molecular docking against target protein RBD of nCoV-SP and ACE-2 using PyRX and iGEMDOCK. Top flavonoids based on docking scores were selected for the pharmacokinetic study. Selected flavonoids (hesperidin, naringin, ECGC, and quercetin) showed excellent pharmacokinetics with proper absorption, solubility, permeability, distribution, metabolism, minimal toxicity, and excellent bioavailability. Molecular dynamics simulation studies up to 100 ns exhibited strong binding affinity of selected flavonoids to RBD of nCoV-SP and ACE-2, and the protein-ligand complexes were structurally stable. These identified lead flavonoids may act as potential compounds for developing effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 by potentially inhibiting virus entry into the host cell.

There is an urgent need for reliable antibody detection approaches to support diagnosis, vaccine development, safe release of individuals from quarantine, and population lock-down exit strategies. We set out to evaluate the performance of ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices. Methods: We tested plasma for COVID (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different LFIA devices. We used a panel of plasma samples from individuals who have had confirmed COVID infection based on a PCR result (n=40), and pre-pandemic negative control samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142). Results: ELISA detected IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs. 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 COVID-positive individuals tested >=10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar. Conclusions: Currently available commercial LFIA devices do not perform sufficiently well for individual patient applications. However, ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following first symptoms.

The real life performance of 7 automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgA immunoassays.,"Swadzba, Jakub; Bednarczyk, Maciej; Anyszek, Tomasz; Kozlowska, Danuta; Panek, Andrzej; Martin, Emilia","Objectives: This study was aimed at providing some insights into the real-life performance of the commercial, clinically validated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays., Methods: The residual, anonymized samples from 97 patients referred for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing were included in the study. The initial assessment was performed with the Euroimmun ELISAs, followed by the assays provided by: NovaTec, Snibe, Vircell, Roche, Abbott and DiaSorin. The analyses of the results were performed separately for the antibodies of the early (IgM/IgA) and late (IgG) immune response., Results: We observed a high variability of the results obtained with the investigated immunoassays. The fully concordant results were reported for only 57 out of 97 samples tested for IgG antibodies and for 34 out of 97 samples for IgM/IgA. The highest percentage of positive results was noted for the Euroimmun and Vircell ELISAs and the lowest for Novatec ELISAs. We proposed to distinguish true and false positive results based on the sum of positive results obtained with different methods. We arbitrarily considered reference positive samples reactive in at least half of the assays. The assay that proved to correlate the best with those reference results was the Roche electrochemiluminescence immunoassay., Conclusions: The differences observed between immunoassays targeting the early phase antibodies were much more pronounced than between IgG assays, suggesting their lower value for clinical use. Our study also showed a high percentage of plausibly false (positive or negative) results obtained with ELISAs, which suggests their inferiority to the automated immunoassays.

Negative Association Between Mediterranean Diet Adherence and COVID-19 Cases and Related Deaths in Spain and 23 OECD Countries: An Ecological Study.,"Greene, Michael W; Roberts, Alexis P; Fruge, Andrew D","In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The high prevalence of nutrition-related COVID-19 risk factors including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, suggests that healthy dietary approaches may mitigate COVID-19 related outcomes and possibly SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the fundamental role of nutrition in immune function and the well-documented association between Mediterranean diet consumption and risk reduction for chronic diseases that are comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, we hypothesized that there would be a relationship between Mediterranean diet adherence and COVID-19 cases and related deaths. In this perspective, we examined the association between regional adherence to a Mediterranean diet and COVID-19 cases and deaths using an ecological study design. We observed that Mediterranean diet adherence was negatively associated with both COVID-19 cases and related deaths across 17 regions in Spain and that the relationship remained when adjusted for factors of well-being. We also observed a negative association between Mediterranean diet adherence and COVID-19 related deaths across 23 countries when adjusted for factors of well-being and physical inactivity. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet - likely due to the polyphenol content of the diet - may be a biological basis to explain our findings. However, there are confounding factors unrelated to dietary factors driving COVID-19 cases and related deaths across the regions in Spain and the 23 countries examined in our analysis. Our findings will need to be confirmed and further explored in cohort studies.

The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy testing, and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay's ability to identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence estimates of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020. For the test validation and performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two by two table analysis to determine the test positive and negative percentage agreement as well as the Kappa agreement value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a Kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811-0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively. The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement [87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)] was observed at >=15 days post-symptom onset (PSO). We found an overall antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Questions remain with respect to the durability and functionality of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This study explored antibody responses in recovered COVID-19 patients in a setting where the probability of re-exposure is effectively nil, owing to New Zealand's successful elimination strategy., Methods: A triplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype (IgG, IgM and IgA) and subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) responses against Nucleocapsid (N) protein, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. After establishing baseline levels with pre-pandemic control sera (n = 113), samples from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease (n = 189) collected up to 8 months post-infection were examined. The relationship between antigen-specific antibodies and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) was explored with a surrogate neutralisation assay that quantifies inhibition of the RBD/hACE-2 interaction., Results: While most individuals had broad isotype and subclass responses to each antigen shortly after infection, only RBD and S protein IgG, as well as NAbs, were relatively stable over the study period, with 99%, 96% and 90% of samples, respectively, having responses over baseline 4-8 months post-infection. Anti-RBD antibodies were strongly correlated with NAbs at all time points (Pearson's r >= 0.87), and feasibility of using finger prick sampling to accurately measure anti-RBD IgG was demonstrated., Conclusion: Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist for up to 8 months following mild-to-moderate infection. This robust response can be attributed to the initial exposure without immune boosting given the lack of community transmission in our setting. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

COVID-19-Associated Acute Brain Dysfunction Related to Sepsis.,"Tong, Dao Ming; Zhou, Ye Ting; Wang, Yuan Wei","In global term, as of November 30, 2020, over 30 million people has been infected by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more than 10,000,000 of them died of acute organ failure. Our reviews have shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have life-threatening acute brain dysfunction (ABD), ranging from altered mental status/delirium to stupor/coma. Altered mental status/delirium was the most common manifestation of ABD caused by severe COVID-19. The prevalence of altered mental status and/or delirium was up to 66-79.5%, and prevalence of coma was 10%. The most common clinical type of COVID-19-associated ABD was COVID-19-associated acute stroke including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (n > 350 cases), followed by COVID-19-associated encephalopathy (n > 200 cases), and COVID-19-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection (n > 70 cases). According to the Sepsis-3 criteria, we confess that severe COVID-19-associated ABD with ARDS and altered mental status is related to sepsis. Moreover, we also review the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-associated ABD with sepsis. In view of the fact that COVID-19 is at the peak of epidemic worldwide, we hope that this review will provide evidence of COVID-19 sepsis threating to the brain dysunction. Thus, recognizing the COVID-19-associated ABD related to sepsis is very important for early empirical combination therapy to survive severe COVID-19.

Burnout and Its Relationship With Depressive Symptoms in Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China.,"Huo, Lijuan; Zhou, Yongjie; Li, Shen; Ning, Yuping; Zeng, Lingyun; Liu, Zhengkui; Qian, Wei; Yang, Jiezhi; Zhou, Xin; Liu, Tiebang; Zhang, Xiang Yang","Objective: The large-scale epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered unprecedented physical and psychological stress on health professionals. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of burnout syndrome, and the relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in China., Methods: A total of 606 frontline medical staff were recruited from 133 cities in China using a cross-sectional survey. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess the level of burnout. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9)., Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.5% of the medical staff experienced burnout. Personal and work-related factors were independently associated with burnout, including age (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.89, p = 0.004), family income (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.99, p = 0.045), having physical diseases (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.42-3.28, p < 0.001), daily working hours (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.77, p = 0.033), and profession of nurse (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.12-4.10, p = 0.022). The correlation coefficients between the scores of each burnout subscale and the scores of depressive symptoms were 0.57 for emotional exhaustion, 0.37 for cynicism, and -0.41 for professional efficacy (all p < 0.001)., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of burnout is extremely high among medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with other psychological disorders, such as depression. Psychological intervention for medical staff is urgently needed. Young and less experienced medical staff, especially nurses, should receive more attention when providing psychological assistance.

Early this year, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great panic and anxiety worldwide. The impact of this acute public health event on the psychological status of hemodialysis patients and its relationship with their quality of life have not been fully investigated. Methods: This study comprised two parts. The initial study enrolled maintenance hemodialysis patients treated in Ruijin Hospital for more than 3 months from March to May 2020 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients completed three questionnaires including the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) Short Form (SF). Follow-up study was performed from December 2020 to January 2021, when the pandemic of COVID-19 has been effectively contained in China. Only patients enrolled in the initial study were approached to participate in the follow-up study. Results: There were 273 maintenance dialysis patients enrolled in the initial study and 247 finished the follow-up study. For the initial study, the estimated prevalence of nonspecific psychiatric morbidity was 45.8% (125/273) by GHQ-28. By IES-R, 53/273 (19.4%) patients presented with total scores above 24 that reflected clinical concerns. We found a significant difference regarding KDQOL scores between patients with different stress response (IES-R) groups (p = 0.026). Our follow-up study showed that KDQOL and SF-36 scores were significantly improved in comparison with those in the initial study (p = 0.006 and p = 0.031, respectively). Though total scores of GHQ-28 and IES-R did not change significantly, some subscales improved with statistical significance. Furthermore, gender, education background, and duration of hemodialysis were three factors that may affect patients' mental health, quality of life, or health status while dialysis duration was the only variable that correlated with those parameters. However, these correlations were combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dialysis itself. Conclusions: We found a correlation between changes in the mental health status of dialysis patients and changes in their quality of life. These responses were also mediated by patients' psychosocial parameters. Our results urge the necessity of psychotherapeutic interventions for some patients during this event.

Simulation-based study of COVID-19 outbreak associated with air-conditioning in a restaurant.,"Liu, Han; He, Sida; Shen, Lian; Hong, Jiarong","COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor airflow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airflow-induced infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow-aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely reported incident. Using flow structure analysis and reverse-time tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the need for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.

Fluid dynamics and epidemiology: Seasonality and transmission dynamics.,"Dbouk, Talib; Drikakis, Dimitris","Epidemic models do not account for the effects of climate conditions on the transmission dynamics of viruses. This study presents the vital relationship between weather seasonality, airborne virus transmission, and pandemic outbreaks over a whole year. Using the data obtained from high-fidelity multi-phase, fluid dynamics simulations, we calculate the concentration rate of Coronavirus particles in contaminated saliva droplets and use it to derive a new Airborne Infection Rate (AIR) index. Combining the simplest form of an epidemiological model, the susceptible-infected-recovered, and the AIR index, we show through data evidence how weather seasonality induces two outbreaks per year, as it is observed with the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. We present the results for the number of cases and transmission rates for three cities, New York, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro. The results suggest that two pandemic outbreaks per year are inevitable because they are directly linked to what we call weather seasonality. The pandemic outbreaks are associated with changes in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed independently of the particular season. We propose that epidemiological models must incorporate climate effects through the AIR index.

The salt-water solution containing particles at reported viral loads is acoustically trapped in a contactless environment to emulate the drying, flow, and precipitation dynamics of real airborne droplets. Similar experiments validate observations with the surrogate fluid with samples of human saliva samples from a healthy subject. A unique feature emerges regarding the final crystallite dimension; it is always 20%-30% of the initial droplet diameter for different sizes and ambient conditions. Airborne-precipitates nearly enclose the viral load within its bulk while the substrate precipitates exhibit a high percentage (~80-90%) of exposed virions (depending on the surface).

Thus, there is always a risk of antimicrobial agent accumulation in food sources that originate from agricultural production., Methods: In the present study, we collected data from published articles between January, 2013 and December, 2019 on antimicrobial residues in human food sources such as meat, milk, eggs, and fishes., Results: Liver contained the highest percentage of antimicrobial residues (74%; 95% CI: 59.66-85.37) against the in vitro enteric pathogen Escherichia coli in layer chickens. Similar results were demonstrated in liver (68%; 95% CI: 53.30-80.48) and kidney (66%, 95% CI: 51.23-78.79) of layer chickens against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Amongst all antibiotics, the highest concentrations of ciprofloxacin were detected in kidney (48.57%; 95% CI: 31.38-66.01), followed by liver (47.56; 95% CI: 40.88-54.30) of broiler chickens. Ciprofloxacin was also present in liver (46.15%; 95% CI: 33.70-58.96) of layer chickens. The percentage of ciprofloxacin in thigh and breast meat in broiler bird were 41.54% (95% CI: 34.54-48.79) and 37.95% (95% CI: 31.11-45.15) respectively. Enrofloxacin was the second most dominant antimicrobial agent and was present in the liver of both types of poultry (Broiler and Layer chickens: 41.54%; 95% CI: 29.44-54.4 and 437.33%; 95% CI: 30.99-44.01). The prevalence rates of enrofloxacin in thigh and breast meat of broiler chickens were 24.10% (95% CI: 18.28-30.73) and 20.51% (95% CI: 15.08-26.87), respectively. Tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic in livestock, was present in the liver (49.23%; 95% CI: 36.60-61.93) of layer chickens. In case of aquaculture food products, the highest amount of amoxicillin (683.2 mg/kg) was detected in Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus), followed by 584.4 mg/kg in climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) and 555.6 mg/kg in Rui fish (Labeo rohita). Among the five types of fishes, Rui fish (0.000515 mg/kg) contained the highest concentrations of chloramphenicol antibiotic residues., Conclusions: The presence of antimicrobial residues in meat, milk, egg, and fish is a serious public health threat due to the potential induction of antimicrobial resistance. It can negatively impact the food supply chain, especially with the current strain that it is already facing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the present study highlight the ongoing risk of residual antimicrobial agents in food of animal origin in Bangladesh and countries with similar practices. This can draw the attention of public health officials to propose plans to mitigate or stop this practice.

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1 x 109 and 1 x 1010 VP elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers that was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these preclinical data confirm efficacy of a one-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.",2021,/,NPJ vaccines,6,1,39,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41541-021-00301-y,33741993,#90901,vanderLubbe 2021,"",""

Therefore, limited data are available about the number of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in the general population across time. To understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, we have developed a cross-sectional study (the 'UNIversity against CORoNavirus study') to investigate infection trends in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020., PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 2023 subjects asymptomatic at the enrolment., PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A nasal mid-turbinate swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and blood specimen for testing serum antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) were collected., RESULTS: Subjects showing positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig is 237 (11.7%). Only 1.2% (n=25) of the total population had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the large majority (21/25) of them were observed in March.

However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time., METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19., RESULTS: At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile.

Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods., METHODS: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection., RESULTS: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection., CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.",2021,/,PloS one,16,3,e0241875,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241875,33760821,#91042,Dixon 2021,"",""
Continued proportional age shift of confirmed positive COVID-19 incidence over time to children and young adults: Washington State March-August 2020.,"Malmgren, Judith; Guo, Boya; Kaplan, Henry G","BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic passed initial infection peak in Washington State, phased re-opening lifted stay-at-home orders and restrictions leading to increased non-essential work, social activities and gathering, especially among younger persons., METHODS: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution 1) March-April 2020 (N = 13,934) and 2) March-August 2020 (N = 76,032) for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance., RESULTS: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 COVID-19 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p < .001). Number of cases over the initial analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n = 4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. After the peak (March 22, 2020), incidence declined in older age groups and increased among age 0-19 and 20-39 age groups from 20% to 40% of total cases by April 19 and 50% by May 3. During this time testing expanded with more testing among older age groups and less testing among younger age groups while case positivity shifted young. Percent positive cases age 0-19/20-39 years through August 2020 increased to a consistent average of 60% [age 0-19 increased to 19% (N = 10257), age 20-39 increased to 42% (N = 30215)]., CONCLUSIONS: An increased sustained proportion of COVID-19 incidence is present among children (age 0-19) and young adults (age 20-39) indicating an elevated role in disease spread during the epidemic creating a possible reservoir of disease with spillover risk to more vulnerable older persons and those with comorbid conditions.

Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current infection could increase access to testing and early confirmation of cases, and expediate clinical and public health management decisions that may reduce transmission., OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups., SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 30 Sept 2020. We checked repositories of COVID-19 publications and included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Diagnostics Global Health website to 16 Nov 2020. We did not apply language restrictions., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of people with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards that define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established diagnostic criteria)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were screened independently in duplicate with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability (made using the QUADAS-2 tool) were undertaken independently in duplicate. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and pooled data using the bivariate model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status., MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-eight study cohorts were included (described in 64 study reports, including 20 pre-prints), reporting results for 24,087 samples (7,415 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe (n = 39) or North America (n = 20), and evaluated 16 antigen and five molecular assays. We considered risk of bias to be high in 29 (50%) studies because of participant selection; in 66 (85%) because of weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection; and in 29 (45%) for participant flow and timing. Studies of antigen tests were of a higher methodological quality compared to studies of molecular tests, particularly regarding the risk of bias for participant selection and the index test. Characteristics of participants in 35 (45%) studies differed from those in whom the test was intended to be used and the delivery of the index test in 39 (50%) studies differed from the way in which the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (97%) defined the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single RT-PCR result, and none included participants meeting case definitions for probable COVID-19. Antigen tests Forty-eight studies reported 58 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies. There were differences between symptomatic (72.0%, 95% CI 63.7% to 79.0%; 37 evaluations; 15530 samples, 4410 cases) and asymptomatic participants (58.1%, 95% CI 40.2% to 74.1%; 12 evaluations; 1581 samples, 295 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (78.3%, 95% CI 71.1% to 84.1%; 26 evaluations; 5769 samples, 2320 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (51.0%, 95% CI 40.8% to 61.0%; 22 evaluations; 935 samples, 692 cases). Sensitivity was high in those with cycle threshold (Ct) values on PCR <=25 (94.5%, 95% CI 91.0% to 96.7%; 36 evaluations; 2613 cases) compared to those with Ct values >25 (40.7%, 95% CI 31.8% to 50.3%; 36 evaluations; 2632 cases). Sensitivity varied between brands. Using data from instructions for use (IFU) compliant evaluations in symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities ranged from 34.1% (95% CI 29.7% to 38.8%; Coris Bioconcept) to 88.1% (95% CI 84.2% to 91.1%; SD Biosensor STANDARD Q). Average specificities were high in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and for most brands (overall summary specificity 99.6%, 95% CI 99.0% to 99.8%). At 5% prevalence using data for the most sensitive assays in symptomatic people (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and Abbott Panbio), positive predictive values (PPVs) of 84% to 90% mean that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 positive results will be a false positive, and between 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence applying the same tests in asymptomatic people would result in PPVs of 11% to 28% meaning that between 7 in 10 and 9 in 10 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. No studies assessed the accuracy of repeated lateral flow testing or self-testing. Rapid molecular assays Thirty studies reported 33 evaluations of five different rapid molecular tests. Sensitivities varied according to test brand. Most of the data relate to the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress assays. Using data from evaluations following the manufacturer's instructions for use, the average sensitivity of ID NOW was 73.0% (95% CI 66.8% to 78.4%) and average specificity 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 4 evaluations; 812 samples, 222 cases). For Xpert Xpress, the average sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 88.1% to 100%) and average specificity 97.2% (95% CI 89.4% to 99.3%; 2 evaluations; 100 samples, 29 cases). Insufficient data were available to investigate the effect of symptom status or time after symptom onset., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. The assays shown to meet appropriate criteria, such as WHO's priority target product profiles for COVID-19 diagnostics ('acceptable' sensitivity >= 80% and specificity >= 97%), can be considered as a replacement for laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. Positive predictive values suggest that confirmatory testing of those with positive results may be considered in low prevalence settings. Due to the variable sensitivity of antigen tests, people who test negative may still be infected. Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts was limited. Test accuracy studies cannot adequately assess the ability of antigen tests to differentiate those who are infectious and require isolation from those who pose no risk, as there is no reference standard for infectiousness. A small number of molecular tests showed high accuracy and may be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR. However, further evaluations of the tests in settings as they are intended to be used are required to fully establish performance in practice. Several important studies in asymptomatic individuals have been reported since the close of our search and will be incorporated at the next update of this review. Comparative studies of antigen tests in their intended use settings and according to test operator (including self-testing) are required. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep quality of medical professionals in Brazil.,"Brito-Marques, Janaina Mariana de Araujo Miranda; Franco, Clelia Maria Ribeiro; Brito-Marques, Paulo Roberto de; Martinez, Sandra Cristina Goncalves; Prado, Gilmar Fernandes do","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus pandemic began in China in 2019 (COVID-19), causing not only public health problems but also great psychological distress, especially for physicians involved in coping with the virus or those of the risk group in social isolation, and this represents a challenge for the psychological resilience in the world population. Studies showed that health professionals had psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, among others., OBJECTIVES: To investigate the quality of sleep and the prevalence rate of sleeping disorders among physicians during COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the psychological and social factors associated with the condition., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of an online questionnaire was applied for physicians in Brazil. Among the 332 participants included, 227 were women. Sociodemographic assessment was used in the questionnaire, as well as the scale of impact on the events of modifications caused by COVID-19, assessment on sleep quality (PSQI), presence and severity of insomnia (ISI), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7)., RESULTS: Most physicians (65.6%) had changes in sleep. Poor sleep quality was reported by 73.1%, depressive symptoms were present in 75.8%, and anxiety in 73.4%., CONCLUSION: Our study found that more than 70% of the physicians assessed had impaired sleep quality, characterizing insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 outbreak. Related factors included an environment of isolation, concerns about COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome in preclinical 3D models of the human bronchial epithelium.,"Sanchez-Guzman, Daniel; Boland, Sonja; Brookes, Oliver; Mc Cord, Claire; Lai Kuen, Rene; Sirri, Valentina; Baeza Squiban, Armelle; Devineau, Stephanie","The human bronchial epithelium is the first line of defense against atmospheric particles, pollutants, and respiratory pathogens such as the novel SARS-CoV-2. The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.",2021,/,Scientific reports,11,1,6621,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86037-0,33758289,#91037,Sanchez-Guzman 2021,"",""

To address this, we developed a Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay that detects total antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and used it to compare antibody responses in 1225 blood donors across Greece. Seroprevalence based on single-antigen readouts was strongly influenced by both the antigen type and cut-off value and ranged widely [0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.5%)-7.5% (95% CI 6.0-8.9%)]. A multi-antigen approach requiring partial agreement between RBD and N or S1 readouts (RBD&N, S1 rule) was less affected by cut-off selection, resulting in robust seroprevalence estimation [0.6% (95% CI 0.3-1.1%)-1.2% (95% CI 0.7-2.0%)] and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals.",2021,/,Scientific reports,11,1,6614,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86035-2,33758278,#91036,Fotis 2021,"",""

Understanding the Differences in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates Observed Across Alabama Counties.,"Velayati, Arash; Dahale, Devesh; Dahlin, Arielle; Hamilton, Caleb; Provost, Lloyd P; Erwin, Paul","To understand county-level variation in case fatality rates of COVID-19, a statewide analysis of COVID-19 incidence and fatality data was performed, using publicly available incidence and case fatality rate data of COVID-19 for all 67 Alabama counties and mapped with health disparities at the county level. A specific adaptation of the Shewhart p-chart, called a funnel chart, was used to compare case fatality rates. Important differences in case fatality rates across the counties did not appear to be reflective of differences in testing or incidence rates. Instead, a higher prevalence of comorbidities and vulnerabilities was observed in high fatality rate counties, while showing no differences in access to acute care. Funnel charts reliably identify counties with unexpected high and low COVID-19 case fatality rates. Social determinants of health are strongly associated with such differences. These data may assist in public health decisions including vaccination strategies, especially in southern states with similar demographics. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The equipment-derived numerical values (S/Co ratio) were recorded. Aliquots from the same units were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein. The relationship between ELISA titers and CLIA S/Co values was analyzed using linear regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve., Results: Twenty-one samples (11.7%) had S/Co values of less than 1.0 and were deemed negative for antibodies and convalescent plasma had S/Co values between >1.0 and 5.0 (70/179, 39.1%). Fifteen units (8.4%) had negative ELISA titer. The majority of the units (95/179. 53.1%) had titers >=1:1024. The sensitivities of ELISA to CLIA were comparable (90.5% vs 88.3%, respectively; p=0.18). There was positive linear correlation between CLIA S/Co values and ELISA IgG titer (Rho = 0.75; Spearman's rank = 0.82, p-value = <0.0001). The agreement between the two methods was fair, with a kappa index of 0.2741. Using the ROC analysis, we identified a CLIA S/Co cutoff value of 8.2, which gives a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 82% in predicting a titer dilution of >=1:1024., Conclusion: The utility of automated antibody detection systems can be extended from simply a screening method to a semi-quantitative and quantitative functional antibody analysis. CLIA S/Co values can be used to reliably estimate the ELISA antibody titer. Incorporation of chemiluminescent-based methods can provide rapid, cost-effective means of identifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in donated plasma for use in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
