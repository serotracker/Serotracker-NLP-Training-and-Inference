{"text": "Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in the early months of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Background: Serologic testing provides better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and its transmission. This study was an investigation of the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Saudi Arabia. Objective(s): To estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Saudi Arabia during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): Serology results and epidemiological data were analyzed for 837 adult blood donors, with no confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in Saudi Arabia from 20th to 25th May 2020. Seroprevalence was determined using electrochemical immunoassay to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Result(s): The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.4% (12/837). Non-citizens had higher seroprevalence compared with citizens (OR 13.6, p = 0.001). Secondary education was significantly associated with higher seroprevalence compared with higher education (OR 6.8, p = 0.005). The data showed that the highest seroprevalence was in Makkah (8.1%). Uisng Makkah seroprevalence as the reference, the seroprevalence in other areas was: Madinah 4.1% (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12-1.94), Jeddah 2.3% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.31-2.25), and Qassim 2.9 % (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.04-2.89) and these were not statistically different from seroprevalence in the Makkah region. Conclusion(s): At the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors was low, but was higher among non-citizens. These findings may indicate that non-citizens and less educated individuals may be less attentive to preventive measures. Monitoring seroprevalence trends over time require repeated sampling.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 Seroepidemiology in Children and Adolescents. <h4>Background: </h4> Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 data remain limited and seropositivity rates in children were reported as <1% early in the pandemic. Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the United States was performed. <h4>Methods:</h4> Children and adolescents \u2264 19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, United States. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens. <h4>Results:</h4> In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Orthogonal antibody testing with a receptor binding domain specific antigen revealed a high concordance of 80.5%. Children also demonstrated a robust immune response to the nucleocapsid antigen. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported. This was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection. The role of pediatric infection and transmission must be considered in COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

Weather and the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still a debated question and currently a hot topic, particularly in view of important decisions regarding opening schools. Therefore, we performed this prospective analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in children with known household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and compared their IgG status with the other adults exposed to the index case in the same household. 30 families with a documented COVID-19 index case were included. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. In particular, 16/27 (59,3%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28/53 (52,3%) of pediatric contacts (P > 0.05). Among the pediatric population, children >= 5 years of age had a similar probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (21/39, 53.8%) compared to those < 5 years old (7/14, 50%) (P > 0.05). Adult partners and children also had a similar probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Interestingly, 10/28 (35.7%) of children and 5/27 (18.5%) of adults with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were previously diagnosed as COVID-19 cases. Our study shows evidence of a high rate of IgG antibodies in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

{"text": "Lack of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among Blood Donors during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Study from Saudi Arabia. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Saudi Arabia have imposed timely restrictions to minimize the infection spread, lower the risk for vulnerable groups, and reduce the pressure on healthcare services. The effectiveness of these measures has not been assessed comprehensively and, thereby, remains uncertain. Besides monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed by molecular assays, the seroprevalence can serve as an indicator for the incidence rate among the general population. This study aimed to evaluate seroprevalence status of all healthy blood donors who attended one of the main largest hospital located in the western region of Saudi Arabia from 1 January to 31 May 2020. The study period covered two months prior to reporting the first COVID-19 case in the country on 2 March 2020. Importantly, it covered the period when \"lock-down type\" measures have been enforced. Samples were subjected to in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and microneutralization (MN). The sero statuses of all samples were confirmed negative, demonstrating the lack of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors during COVID-19 lockdown period.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in the general population and high-risk occupational groups across 18 cities in Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study. Background: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. Method(s): In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). Finding(s): From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17.1% (95% CI 14.6-19.5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043-4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72.6% [53.9-92.8]) and Qom (58.5% [37.2-83.9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20.0% (18.5-21.7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. Interpretation(s): Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

{"text": "Seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 antibodies in Southern Italy's hospital staff. Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Respiratory/aerial droplets transmission and the high number of \"hidden\" asymptomatic cases play a critical role in the rapid spread of the virus across countries. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population is currently unknown. It has been estimated that undocumented infections were the source for #80% of the documented cases before traveling restriction policies took place. Serological evaluation is essential for investigating the extent of SARS-CoV-2. Even more, assessing the prevalence of anti-SARSCoV-2 in hospital staff offers a unique opportunity to study the correlation between seroconversion and immunization because of their occupational exposure and at higher risk of contagious. Method(s): The study enrolled a total of 3242 employees of our hospital, \"Policlinico Riuniti\" of Foggia. The employees' group was stratified in 3 subgroups according to their relative exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high, intermediate, and low-risk groups). We used a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech) to study the seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies (IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid and spike proteins). The cut-off was set to 8 AU/mL for both IgG and IgM (specificity of 98,8% and 100%, respectively). A control group of 83 samples sera collected before the Italian COVID-19 outbreak (2018-19) was also tested. Healthcare workers with IgG or IgM concentration above 6.0 and below 8.0 AU/mL were considered borderline. Nevertheless, all of them were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA presence (AllplexTM 2019 n-CoV Assay, Seegene). Result(s): Sixty-two individuals (1.9%, 1.4-2.3%, 95% CI) tested positive for at least one antibody anti-SARS-CoV-2. Five individuals (8.0% of the positive) had IgG and IgM positive test results, while 32 and 25 had only IgG and only IgM positive results. Instead, viral RNA was detected in only nine individuals (13.8% of Ig positive) by RTPCR. The cumulative proportion of individuals who tested positive (IgG and/or IgM) varied between 1-2.4%. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group 1.4% (6/428,0.5-2.6%, 95% CI) vs. intermediate-risk group 2.0 % (55/2736, 1.5-2.5%, 95% CI). Only one participant (1.3%, 0-3.8%, 95% CI) of the low-risk group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Conclusion(s): The low level of seropositivity (1.9%) shows that the COVID-19 containment measures adopted were adequate and effective. Moreover, the combination of both serological and molecular tests can improve the likelihood of identifying asymptomatic subjects.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Experience from 181 patients in New York. SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid beta-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients.

{"text": "Antibody Status and Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Health Care Workers. BACKGROUND: The relationship between the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the risk of subsequent reinfection remains unclear., METHODS: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time., RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status., CONCLUSIONS: The presence of positive anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the ensuing 6 months.

{"text": "Covert cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: An obscure but present danger in regions endemic for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. BACKGROUND: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in regions endemic for both Dengue and Chikungunya is still not fully understood. Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil., METHODS: Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020., FINDINGS: Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed., INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

AIM: To evaluate three fully automated serological assays in terms of reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and perform SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing among asymptomatic health care workers (HCW) at the University Hospital Center Zagreb., METHODS: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays., RESULTS: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The duration, dynamics and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in individual healthcare workers. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary., METHODS: We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning., RESULTS: Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected.

Background: The role of subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in perpetuating the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown because population seroprevalence data are absent. We aimed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay, and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong before and after the pandemic, as well as in Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China., Methods: We did a multicohort study in a hospital and university in Hong Kong. We evaluated the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with RT-PCR data from patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and the specificity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay with archived serum samples collected before 2019. We compared the seropositivity of the general population of Hong Kong before and after the pandemic had begun, and determined the seropositivity of Hong Kong residents evacuated from Hubei province, China, in March, 2020., Findings: Between Feb 26 and March 18, 2020, we assessed RT-PCR samples from 45 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 to establish the sensitivity of our enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. To establish the specificity of these assays, we retrieved archived serum. The sensitivity was 91.1% (41 of 45 [95% CI 78.8-97.5]) for the microneutralisation assay, 57.8% (26 of 45 [42.2-72.3]) for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 66.7% (30 of 45 [51.1-80.0]) for anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and 73.3% (33 of 45 [58.1-85.4]) for enzyme immunoassay (either positive for anti-nucleoprotein or anti-RBD IgG). The specificity was 100% (152 of 152 [95% CI 97.6-100.0]) for both the enzyme immunoassay and microneutralisation assay. Among the Hong Kong general population, 53 (2.7%) of 1938 were enzyme immunoassay positive, but of those who were positive, all 53 were microneutralisation negative, and no significant increase was seen in the seroprevalence between April 12, 2018, and Feb 13, 2020. Among asymptomatic Hubei returnees, 17 (4%) of 452 were seropositive with the enzyme immunoassay or the microneutralisation assay, with 15 (88%) of 17 seropositive with the microneutralisation assay, and two familial clusters were identified., Interpretation: Our serological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging virus. The seropositivity rate in Hubei returnees indicates that RT-PCR-confirmed patients only represent a small proportion of the total number of cases. The low seroprevalence suggests that most of the Hong Kong and Hubei population remain susceptible to COVID-19. Future waves of the outbreak are inevitable without a vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis.

More than 2.4 million SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology (initiated April 21, 2020) and 6.6 million nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (initiated March 9, 2020) results on persons from across the United States as of July 10, 2020 were analyzed. Additional IgG serology results through August 11, 2020 were used for one household analysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity was observed in 91% (19,434/21,452) of individuals tested after a positive NAAT result and in 10% (7,831/80,968) after a negative NAAT result. Factors associated with seropositivity include age, region of patient residence, and interval between NAAT and IgG serology. The probability of persistent IgG seropositivity declined from 98.6% after 1 week to 74.3% after 2 months, less so in individuals ages >=55 years than in younger groups. Specimens within 2 days from pairs of same-household members showed 92% IgG antibody concordance. Household adults were more frequently IgG positive prior to household children testing positive (36% versus 8%). IgG serology testing can identify an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that varies based on age, sex, and duration since exposure. Loss of detectable IgG seropositivity occurs, in some patients, over weeks or months. Adults may be infecting household children.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Effectiveness of infection-containment measures on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and circulation from May to July 2020, in Milan, Italy. Objective Through a hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological screening, we evaluated the effectiveness of two months of lockdown and two of surveillance, in Milan, Lombardy, the first to be overwhelmed by COVID-19 pandemics during March-April 2020. Methods All subjects presenting at the major hospital of Milan from May-11 to July-5, 2020, underwent a serological screening by chemiluminescent assays. Those admitted were further tested by RT-PCR. Results The cumulative anti-N IgG seroprevalence in the 2753 subjects analyzed was of 5.1% (95%CI = 4.3%-6.0%), with a peak of 8.4% (6.1%-11.4%) 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses (March-20). 31/106 (29.2%) anti-N reactive subjects had anti-S1/S2 titers >80 AU/mL. Being tested from May-18 to June-5, or residing in the provinces with higher SARS-CoV-2 circulation, were positively and independently associated with anti-N IgG reactivity (OR [95%CI]: 2.179[1.455-3.264] and 3.127[1.18-8.29], respectively). In the 18 RT-PCR positive, symptomatic subjects, anti-N seroprevalence was 33.3% (95% CI: 14.8%-56.3%). Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Milan is low, and in a downward trend after only 60-63 days since the peak of diagnoses. Italian confinement measures were effective, but the risk of contagion remains concrete. In hospital-settings, the performance of molecular and serological screenings upon admission remains highly advisable.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Cento et al.

{"text": "Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. BACKGROUND: Although many viral respiratory illnesses are transmitted within households, the evidence base for SARS-CoV-2 is nascent. We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission., METHODS: We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22-April 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test., RESULTS: Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4-106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2-42.5)., CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts. People with COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care to promptly self-isolate to prevent household transmission.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. METHOD(S): The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULT(S): Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide.

Introduction: Rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests can play an important role in the COVID-19 surveillance by supporting the diagnosis of infection, assessing the immune response, and verifying the progress towards herd immunity. Objective: To evaluate the performance of rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody tests in COVID-19 occupational surveillance in a group of Colombian enterprises. Materials and methods: We used the occupational surveillance data from companies that had performed periodic serological tests on all personnel from the end of April to the beginning of July, 2020. Workers were organized in small groups (\"social bubbles\") to prevent outbreaks and optimize surveillance. The sensitivity was estimated as if the sampling had a prospective design. We describe here the changes in serological testing through periodic rounds. Results: Data were obtained from 4,740 workers, of whom only 23 were symptomatic showing changes from IgM(-)/IgG(-) to IgM(+) and then to IgM(+)/IgG(+) and IgG(+). The sensitivity was 40.94% for IgM(+) and 47.95% for IgM(+)/IgG(+). This implies that a little less than half of the cases can be detected. Conclusion: Antibody rapid tests have a role in the diagnostic process of infection and they must be evaluated taking into account the moment of the epidemic, the type of test purchased, and the populations at risk since their results depend on the number of infections and cases. In the context of a health crisis, they can be optimized by organizing workers into \"social bubbles\"", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 seropositivity and asymptomatic rates in healthcare workers are associated with job function and masking. BACKGROUND: Although the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is higher for frontline healthcare workers, not all personnel have similar risks. Determining infection rate is difficult due to the limits on testing and the high rate of asymptomatic individuals. Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be useful for determining prior exposure to the virus and assessing mitigation strategies, such as isolation, masks, and other protective equipment., METHODS: An online assessment that included demographic, clinical, and exposure information and a blood sample was collected from 20,614 participants out of ~43,000 total employees at Beaumont Health, which includes eight hospitals distributed across the Detroit metropolitan area in southeast Michigan. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined using the EUROIMMUN assay., RESULTS: A total of 1,818 (8.8%) participants were seropositive between April 13 and May 28, 2020. Among the seropositive individuals, 44% reported that they were asymptomatic during the month prior to blood collection. Healthcare roles such as phlebotomy, respiratory therapy, and nursing/nursing support exhibited significantly higher seropositivity. Among participants reporting direct exposure to a COVID-19 positive individual, those wearing an N95/PAPR mask had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (10.2%) compared to surgical/other masks (13.1%) or no mask (17.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the likelihood of seropositivity among employees but study participants who wore a mask during COVID-19 exposures were less likely to be seropositive. Additionally, a large proportion of seropositive employees self-reported as asymptomatic.

{"text": "Estimates of the rate of infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease in a population sample from SE England. BACKGROUND: Understanding of the true asymptomatic rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited, as is understanding of the population-based seroprevalence after the first wave of COVID-19 within the UK. The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. METHOD(S): We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. FINDINGS: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study. Anosmia demonstrated the highest symptom specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. FUNDING: NIHR BRC, CDRF, ZOE global LTD, RST-UKRI/MRC.Copyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "321 Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Pediatric Health Care Workers in Atlanta, Georgia. Background: The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric health care workers (HCWs) in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infection is unknown. Working at the front line, emergency department (ED) HCWs are uniquely at high risk. It is unknown if seropositivity in this population is similar to community levels or is substantially higher as a result of work-based exposure to infectious children who may demonstrate mild symptoms. Further, the experience of pediatric HCWs may be disparate from adult focused facilities because prior to implementation of social distancing, children presented for care at pediatric facilities in high numbers with mild illness. Many were evaluated in pediatric EDs which may have put pediatric HCWs at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic before universal personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization became standard practice. The milder nature of COVID-19 in children has also led some to believe that children are not affected, although the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refutes this notion. However, this belief and the lack of data may result in lax utilization to PPE in pediatric settings. Data describing seropositivity among pediatric HCWs is not yet available. Study Objective: Determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric HCWs. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing data from the baseline visit of a prospective cohort to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs at a large pediatric health care facility in April-May 2020. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and level of anxiety about COVID-19 was determined. Symptomatic or febrile HCWs were excluded. Metrics were analyzed overall and by HCW roles and tested for differences using chi-square estimates of independence. Prevalence of IgG antibodies were compared in ED vs. non-ED HCWs. Result(s): Of 300 HCWs enrolled from April 16-May 18, 2020, their mean age range is 41-50 years, 83% are female and 75% have no comorbidities. HCWs include 33% physicians, 25% nurses 10% respiratory therapists, 7% advance practice providers, and 25% other. Forty-seven percent were emergency department (ED) staff, 13% worked in pediatric intensive care, 40% elsewhere. Half of all HCWs had children in their home, 45% had traveled outside the state, and 47% reported an illness since January. Overall, 28% had a known COVID-19+ exposure. Most participants (90%) believed they were at high risk to develop COVID-19 as HCWs, and 70% reported high anxiety due to the pandemic. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in this cohort is 4.7%. Of the 14 HCWs with positive serology, only 3 (21%) had a history of any prior COVID-19 testing, all of which were positive; 43% (6/14) had no prior flu-like illness or symptoms. Eighty-six percent of antibody-positive HCWs were ED-based staff; SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 9% of ED HCWs enrolled compared to 1% in non-ED based HCWs, p=0.003. Conclusion(s): Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is low in pediatric HCWs living in a region with high COVID-19 activity. Most cases were found in HCWs from the pediatric ED, and nearly half were asymptomatic. ED-based pediatric HCWs may be uniquely at higher risk of exposure to children with COVID-19, and particularly may have been at higher risk of infection before awareness of the evolving pandemic; ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. The application of point of care serological testing can help determine past infection and assist healthcare workers assess patient risk. Method: An observational study of 114 subjects in North Suburban Chicago, Illinois, was performed using the Clungene (R) lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). Patients' PCR test results and clinical symptoms were used to compare the seroconversion rate of this patient population with the surrounding community. Results: Excluding 1 aberrant result, there was 100% positive agreement (10) between PCR and antibody (IgG or IgM) test results. There were 7 patients who did not have a prior PCR test who were positive for IgG; 5 of the 7 had clinical symptoms consistent with possible exposure and 2 were asymptomatic. There was 1 person with a suspected exposure to an infected person who was IgM positive. Ninety-five asymptomatic patients were seronegative. The overall rate of 15.9% seroconversion (IgG or IgM) is consistent with other community-based testing results in the North Suburban Chicago, Illinois area. Conclusion: Rapid screening tests to identify antibody positive patients recovered from coronavirus disease-2019 can be a useful tool for healthcare professionals to determine or confirm past infection.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 lockdown period from March 17 to May 11, 2020, French authorities in Paris and its suburbs relocated people experiencing recurrent homelessness to emergency shelters, hotels, and large venues. A serological survey was done at some of these locations to assess the COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group., METHODS: We did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Medecins Sans Frontieres in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test. Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms., FINDINGS: Between June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites. Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site (chi2 p<0.0001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (88.7%, 95% CI 81.8-93.2), followed by emergency shelters (50.5%, 46.3-54.7), and food distribution sites (27.8%, 20.8-35.7). More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 64.2-72.2; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.

{"text": "Estimation of real-infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Indian populations. Infection born by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has swept the world within a time of a few months. It has created a devastating effect on humanity with social and economic depressions. Europe and America were the hardest hit continents. India has also lost several lives, making the country fourth most deadly worldwide. However, the infection and death rate per million and the case fatality ratio in India were substantially lower than many of the developed nations. Several factors have been proposed including the genetics. One of the important facts is that a large chunk of Indian population is asymptomatic to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the real infection in India is much higher than the reported number of cases. Therefore, the majority of people are already immune in the country. To understand the dynamics of real infection as well as level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2, we have performed antibody testing (serosurveillance) in the urban region of fourteen Indian districts encompassing six states. In our survey, the seroprevalence frequency varied between 0.01-0.48, suggesting high variability of viral transmission among states. We also found out that the cases reported by the Government were several fold lower than the real infection. This discrepancy is majorly driven by a higher number of asymptomatic cases. Overall, we suggest that with the high level of immunity developed against SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of the districts, it is less likely to have a second wave in India.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

However, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients is still poorly characterized., OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 on hemodialysis patients., METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 66 hemodialysis patients. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR and serology for SARS-CoV-2, blood analysis, chest radiography, treatment, and outcomes were assessed., RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in 50 patients: 38 (76%) were PCR-positive and 12 (24%) were PCR-negative but developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By contrast, 17% of PCR-positive patients failed to develop detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among PCR-positive patients, 5/38 (13%) were asymptomatic, while among PCR-negative patients 7/12 (58%) were asymptomatic (p = 0.005) for a total of 12/50 (24%) asymptomatic patients. No other differences were found between PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. No differences in potential predisposing factors were found between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients except for a lower use of ACE inhibitors among asymptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients had laboratory evidence of milder disease such as higher lymphocyte counts and oxygen saturation and lower troponin I and interleukin-6 levels than symptomatic patients. Overall mortality was 7/50 (14%) and occurred only in symptomatic PCR-positive patients in whom mortality was 7/33 (21%)., CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common in hemodialysis patients, especially among patients with initial negative PCR that later seroconvert.

Background: Early and accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to prevent spread of the infection. Understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient, particularly in relation to those whose responses persist for more than 1 month after the onset of symptoms. We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to identify factors affecting the serological response and to evaluate its diagnostic utility in patients with COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We collected 1,048 residual serum samples from 396 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.

Present study aimed to evaluate the incidence rate and the development of immune response among healthcare workers during the height of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic in Kazakhstan. The prospective study was carried out on the basis of the Syzganov National Scientific Center of Surgery in the period from July 2020 to August 2020. The project involved 248 people. In total, there were 50 men and 198 women under study, aged 21 to 80 years, with the average age of men being 43.3 +/- 0.2 years, women - 37.4 +/- 0.3 years. The total percentage of antibody detection was 11.7% (29 participants). The largest percentage of the development of an immune response was among junior medical personnel IgG was detected in 10 (4%)Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in 1 (0.4%), while among the middle and senior medical personnel IgG and IgM was 7 (2.8%) and 1 (0.4%), respectively. Antibodies were not detected among paraclinical and technical personnel. Of the 29 seropositive results, IgG was detected in 24, IgM in 3, and IgG + IgM in 2, respectively. The presence of immune response among medical personnel, a significant percentage of infection was in clinical personnel compared to paraclinical and technical personnel. The majority of subjects with a seropositive result had an asymptomatic course.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Yerevan State Medical University. All rights reserved.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

Aim: We aimed to assess the risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a large cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs). <h4>Methods:</h4> From May 11 until June 11, 2020, 3,981 HCWs at a large Swedish Emergency Care hospital provided serum samples and questionnaire data. Exposure was measured by assaying IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Results:</h4> The total seroprevalence was 17.7% and increased during the study period. Among the seropositive HCWs, 10.5% had been entirely asymptomatic. Participants who worked with COVID-19 patients had higher odds for seropositivity: ORadj 1.96 (95% CI 1.59-2.42). HCWs from three of the departments managing COVID-19 patients had significantly higher seroprevalences, whereas the prevalence among HCWs from the Intensive Care Unit (also managing COVID-19 patients) was significantly lower. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> HCWs in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a variable, but on average higher, likelihood for SARS-CoV-2 infections.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Lessons from low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in schoolchildren: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Children are discussed as hidden SARS-CoV-2 virus reservoir because of predominantly mild or even asymptomatic course of disease. The objective of this cross-sectional study in May-July 2020 was to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and virus RNA in schoolchildren, consistent with previous infection by contact tracing., METHODS: School authorities approached parents for voluntary participation. Interested families were contacted by the study team. A nasal and oropharyngeal swab, a blood sample, and a questionnaire were employed. Primary endpoint was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR- and antibody-positive children. Antibody-positivity was assessed by a highly-sensitive first-line ELISA, and a neutralization assay and two other immunoassays as confirmatory assays., RESULTS: Of 2069 children (median age 13 years, IQR 10-15) 2 cases (0.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and 26 cases (1.3%) tested positive for specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies exhibited detectable virus-neutralizing activity in 92% (24 of 26 samples). Seropositivity was associated with a history of mild clinical symptoms in 14 children (53.8%), while 12 children (46.2%) remained asymptomatic. Among 13 seropositive children being tested concomitantly with their siblings, only one pair of siblings was seropositive. Contact tracing revealed adult family members and school teachers as potential index cases., CONCLUSION: In school children, the infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 is low and associated with a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. Virus spreading seemed to occur more likely in intergenerational contacts than among siblings in the same household. The presence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children may reflect protective adaptive immunity. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Positivity in a Large Longitudinal Sero-Surveillance Cohort: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. <h4>Background: </h4> Estimating population prevalence and incidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to formulate public health recommendations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. <h4>Methods:</h4> We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies. The impact of the large number of minimally symptomatic COVID-19 cases with only a brief antibody response on population immunity remains to be determined.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance to assess the proportion of a population that has developed antibodies against a newly introduced virus and could therefore potentially exhibit immunologic protection against subsequent infection. This study aims to understand the distribution of IgM and IgG antibodies in the Dominican Republic. We surveyed a total of 12,897 participants between April and June 2020 in 10 provinces of the Dominican Republic. Survey efforts in emerging hotspots yielded a positivity for all participants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM of 3.8% and IgG of 5.4%, indicating that the pathogen was in circulation before the identification of those particular communities as hotspots. We found important age differences between participants who participated in the serological study where a higher mean age is associated IgM positivity and a lower age with IgG positivity. Our results highlight the need for strategies that involve community-based seroprevalence monitoring. These should preclude syndromic case identification. Also, the higher mean age of IgM-positive participants suggests that strategies based on syndromic surveillance could identify hotspots at later phases, based on the number of cases detected at the healthcare center, as such community-based seroprevalence monitoring may be an effective intervention for future outbreaks.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: The burden of COVID-19 is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations. Additionally, the disease prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains unknown. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study tested convenience samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant, bone marrow transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULT(S): We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (CI 95%: 0.3-2.4%). Two patients were positive by NP swab RT-PCR, but only one seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or solid organ transplant were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared to other groups. CONCLUSION(S): Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and two patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in China and quickly spread throughout the world and was reclassified as a pandemic in March 2020. The first case of COVID-19 was declared in Togo on March 5. Two months later, few data were available to describe the circulation of the new coronavirus in the country., OBJECTIVE: This survey aimed to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations in Lome., MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 23, 2020, to May 8, 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: health care, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swabs for direct detection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and blood for antibody detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests., RESULTS: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included, and 71.6% (n = 684) were men. Approximately 22.1% (n = 212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n = 196) were from the police sector, and 38.7% (n = 370) were from the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR test result at the time of recruitment, and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2. We found an overall prevalence of 1.6% (n = 15), 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk populations in Lome was relatively low and could be explained by the various measures taken by the Togolese government.

OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 causing the pulmonary disease COVID-19 has challenged healthcare facilities worldwide. The sustainability of healthcare systems is largely reliant on the health status of their health care workers (HCW). This study was aimed at the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and specific antibodies among HCW in a German hospital, as a model system for the potential spread of the pandemic. METHOD(S): Between March and June 2020, we performed this study using a combination of RT-PCR test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ELISA to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among HCW in a German hospital by repetitive oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and blood samples. RESULT(S): A total of 871/1081 employees participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During the study period of 9 weeks, 5329 OPS and 2136 blood samples were analyzed. In three participants (0.34%) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 38 (4.36%) participants. CONCLUSION(S): Our study reports low prevalence of COVID-19 in HCW, which may reflect the effectiveness of hygiene protocols. It might, however, indicate a low prevalence of SARS CoV-2 in hospital employees.

Objective In this study, we aimed at comparing the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in healthcare workers (HCWs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving and non-COVID-19 receiving hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in a COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'A') and a non-COVID-19 receiving hospital (hospital 'B'). Using stratified random sampling, 1,011 HCWs (439 from hospital 'A' and 572 from hospital 'B') were recruited to participate in the study. Immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) antibodies were checked using Elecsys R (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. The chi-squared test was used to compare frequencies, and the binary logistic regression model was used to predict the association between study variables' seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the two hospitals was 30.76%. It was 28.2% in hospital 'A' and 32.7% in hospital 'B' (p=0.129). The seroprevalence in HCWs having direct contact with COVID-19 patients was higher (33.1%) in non-COVID-19 receiving hospital versus 23.8% in COVID-19 receiving hospital (p=0.034). Seroprevalence was highest among administrative staff (44.0%), followed by nurses (30.8%), residents (19.8%), and consultants (17.8%) (p=0.001). As compared to consultants, the administrative and nursing staff were 3.398 and 3.116 times more likely to have positive antibodies, respectively. There were no significant differences in the seroprevalence between the respective categories of staff of the two hospitals. Conclusions The non-COVID-19 receiving hospital had a higher proportion of seropositive HCWs than the COVID-19 receiving hospital. The HCWs in the non-COVID-19 receiving hospital who had direct contact with patients had significantly higher seroprevalence. Seroprevalence was highest for administrative staff followed by nursing staff, residents, and consultants. Regardless of the COVID-19 status of the healthcare facility, all HCWs shall be trained on, and consistently follow, the proper protocols for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE).

{"text": "Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study. Objective: Currently, little is known about the progression of an immune response against SARSCoV- 2 upon infection or sub-infection-exposure over time. We examined the serologic response in healthcare workers up to 12 weeks after a well-documented and contained outbreak and compared results with findings from earlier serologic testing in the same population. Methods: This study followed 166 health care workers of the University Perinatal Care Center, Regensburg, Germany, for up to 12 weeks. 27 of the subjects had previously tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing and developed COVID-19. Serologic responses were tested with two independent commercially available test kits. Results: 77.8 % of COVID-19 study subjects developed a specific IgG-response over the course of the 12-week study, while none of the COVID-19 contact groups had a detectable IgG response. Amongst most COVID-19 patients the values of detectable IgG-responses significantly increased over time as confirmed with both tests, while that of positive IgA responses decreased. Between the number of reported symptoms and antibody responses in COVID-19 patients no correlation was found and no new cases of seroconversion were identified in asymptomatic coworkers with negative PCR during the outbreak. Conclusions: Immune response after COVID-19 increases significantly over time but still approximately 22 % of COVID-19 patients did not mount a measurable serologic immune response within 60 days. Exposed co-workers did not develop any relevant antibody levels at all. We conclude that immunity after infection increases over time, but the antibody response does not develop reliably in all infected people.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

The characteristics of the antibody response are not yet completely clear. This study describes a serological monitoring of subjects, elderly nursing care residence guests, interested by a very large infection outbreak. After first nasopharyngeal swab, all the positive subjects (43) were monitored for the persistence of the virus infection through nasopharyngeal swab after 20 days (16-24), 32 days (28-36) and after 49 days (47-50). At the same time, during the second (day 32) and third (day 49) follow up, all the guests were investigated for IgM and IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, by using a quantitative chemiluminescence method. Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative.

In this study, the performance of a rapid serological test in a clinical setting was evaluated. Samples from 819 consecutive patients (with or without respiratory symptoms) admitted to a large Emergency Department were tested between 23 March and 21 April 2020. Patient samples were tested in a real-time PCR assay and a serological assay. In total, 148/819 patients (18.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. The serological test revealed that 70/819 patients (8.5%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG.

BACKGROUND: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay., RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant).

Objective: We aimed to assess the magnitude of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infections in our healthcare personnel (HCP) early in the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate risk factors for infection in order to identify areas for infection control practice improvement in a northern California academic medical center. Method(s): We reviewed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG serologic test results and self-reported risk factors for seropositivity among 10,449 asymptomatic HCP who underwent voluntary serology testing between April 20 and May 20, 2020. Result(s): In total, 136 employees (1.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This included 41 (30.1%) individuals who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 13 and April 16, 2020. In multivariable analysis, employees of Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.01; 95% CI = 1.22-3.46) and those working in environmental services/food services/patient transport (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 2.08-10.30) were at increased risk for seropositivity compared to other groups. Employees reporting a household contact with COVID-19 were also at higher risk for seropositivity (OR = 3.25; 95% CI = 1.47-6.44), but those with a work exposure were not (OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.58-2.47). Importantly, one-third of seropositive individuals reported no prior symptoms, no suspected exposures, and no prior positive RT-PCR test. Conclusion(s): In this study, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP early in the northern California epidemic appeared to be quite low and was more likely attributable to community rather than occupational exposure.

{"text": "Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in cancer outpatients in Madrid (Spain): A single center, prospective, cohort study and a review of available data. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global pandemic. Published data suggests that patients with a history of or active malignancy are at increased risk of infection and developing COVID-19 related complications. To date, the published data has analyzed the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in the general population, but not in cancer patients. Here we present the results of prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients from the University Hospital of Torrejon (Torrejon de Ardoz, Madrid, Spain)., METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies was assessed using a commercially available rapid test (Testsealabs R IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette) and collect the result from cancer outpatients who attended the medical oncology consult at University Hospital of Torrejon between June 1st and June 19th, 2020., FINDINGS: We analyzed the serological test results of 229 cancer patients. We estimated an overall seroprevalence (IgG or IgM positive) of 31.4%. The probability of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was similar between men and women, type of treatment and cancer stage. The probability of seropositivity was significantly higher in cancer patients with pneumonia compared with cancer patients without pneumonia (Odds Ratio (OR) 7.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1,85-31,58])., INTERPRETATION: Our results show a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in cancer patients than in the general population. The role of those antibodies in the immune response against the virus infection is unclear. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in health care workers of the Veneto Region. The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may be used for improving disease management when appropriately applied, for investigating the antibody responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impractical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCW) who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region of Italy by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called MaglumiTM 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China). A total of 8,285 HCW were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% of women vs. 5.0% of men, but this difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all HCW who developed severe COVID-19 infection (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study defined precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of HCW in the Veneto Region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.

OBJECTIVES: To assess population-based prevalence, risk factors, hospitalization, and infection fatality rates (IFR) associated with COVID-19. METHOD(S): We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitants industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear coefficients of determination (R2). RESULT(S): Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74 to 4.18), 34% lower in elderly >=60 years-old. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06 to 0.11) to 4.63% (2.93 to 7.84) in individuals 20 to 39 years-old and >=60 years-old, respectively. R2 for exponential age-dependent hospitalization rate and IFR were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent.

Background Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6,p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.", "label": "included", "metadata": ""}

Community-level seroprevalence surveys are needed to determine the proportion of the population with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a necessary component of COVID-19 disease surveillance. In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%). People who self-identified as not believing they had COVID-19 had the lowest prevalence 4.8% (95% CI 2.3%, 8.2%). The range of seroprevalence after correction for potential selection bias was 21.9% to 24.2%. This study suggests more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were not reported.

{"text": "Seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in the cleaning and oncological staff of a municipal clinic. Aim: To prevent shedding of the novel COVID-19 virus in hospitals, strict hygiene measures and surveillance of the staff and patients is mandatory. Studying the available literature, we assumed that monitoring of the cleaning staff may sometimes be a \"blind spot\" in surveillance. Although the cleaning personnel is not entrusted with the medical and nursing care of patients, the extent of patient contacts in this group may be comparable to medical personnel and even increase in times of a visit ban in many hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections already undergone in this group. Methods: Antibody titers (IgA and IgG) against COVID-19 were measured in the cleaning staff from June 15th to 30th, 2020 in our clinic. Antibodies against COVID-19 were determined using ELISA (EUROIMMUN TM, PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). For purposes of comparison, the same procedure was performed in the staff of the oncology ward, who were regarded as an important group due to their high-risk patients. Results: During the study period, 45 members of the cleaning staff and 20 members of the oncology ward were tested. Significantly elevated IgA antibody titers were detected in 1 person in the first group and in 1 person in the second group. Significantly elevated IgG antibody titers were not detected in the first group and in 1 person of the second group. In case of positive or indeterminate testing, swabs for direct virus detection were taken, but were negative in all cases. Conclusion:  The prevalence of already undergone infections in both groups is low, as to be expected due to the still low incidence of COVID-19 infections in the German federal state of Thuringia. However, the presence of such antibodies in the cleaning personnel demonstrates the need for equally strict surveillance in this group.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are a population highly vulnerable to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese MHD patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From Dec 1, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020, 1027 MHD patients in five large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China were enrolled. Patients were screened by blood tests, chest computed tomography, NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME(S): Morbidity, clinical features, laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL: Approach Differences between groups were examined by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected to those infected and comparing those with infection detected by NAT to with positive serology tests and negative NAT. RESULT(S): Of the 1027 MHD patients, 99 cases have been identified as SARS-CoV-2 infection, equivalent to a prevalence of 9.6%. In the 99 cases, 52 (53%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (48%) patients were identified by positive IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with negative NAT. The spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients showed IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (75%), and both positive IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). 51% of the infected patients were asymptomatic during the epidemic. Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often identified with infection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and they tended to be more symptomatic than other patient groups. LIMITATIONS: Possibility of false positives and false negatives for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSION(S): Half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in MHD patients were subclinical and unidentified by universal chest CT and selective NAT. Serologic testing may help to evaluate the overall prevalence and understand the diversity of clinical course among MHD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.Copyright \u00a9 2020.

For planning of treatment capacities, it is of major importance to obtain reliable information on infection and fatality rates of the novel coronavirus.

We were interested to examine the SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody status among clinic staff of a large neurological center in Northern Germany. Blood samples and questionnaires (demographic data, medical history) were collected pseudonymously. In total, 406 out of 525 (77.3%) of our employees participated in the study. The infection rate among the staff was as high as 2.7%. Including drop-outs (missing questionnaire but test result available), the infection rate was even higher (2.9%). Only 36% of the positively tested employees did suffer from flu-like symptoms in 2020. None of the nurses-having closest and longest contact to patients-were found to be positive. Despite the fact that the infection rate among clinic staff may not be directly compared to the situation in the surrounding county (due to different testing procedures), one might hypothesize that the infection rate could be more than 30-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for the county of Hameln-Pyrmont.

BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHOD(S): The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULT(S): Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman rho 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION(S): The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Heart Rhythm Society.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global and challenging disease that is accompany with mortality and morbidity., AIM OF STUDY: We evaluated the prevalence and the impact of comorbidities in thalassemia Iranian patients affected by COVID-19. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted across all comprehensive thalassemia centers in Iran, from January to June 15th, 2020., RESULTS: Forty-three confirmed COVID-19 thalassemia patients (32 TDT, and 11 NTDT) were detected. The mean age of patients was 35.3 +/- 11.5 years (range 9 - 67); 21 females and 22 males. Overall, 78.1% of TDT and 90.9% of NTDT patients were complicated with at least one comorbidity (P: 0.656). The overall mortality rate of thalassemia patients with COVID-19 was 18.6% while 27.3% was in NTDT patients compared to 15.6% in TDT patients (P:0.401).

{"text": "Homeless Shelter Characteristics and Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. INTRODUCTION: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators., RESULTS: A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "COVID-19 in a state of Brazilian Northeast: prevalence and associated factors in people with flu-like syndrome. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors to COVID-19 in people with flu-like syndrome in Ceara-Brazil. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has led to a worldwide public health emergency. More than 30,000 cases were confirmed in Brazil, especially in the States of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ceara. The capital of the Ceara State is the one with the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil. Estimating the prevalence of the disease and its associated factors is important to offer adequate health care. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with secondary data of people notified with flu-like syndrome and COVID-19 test results. METHOD(S): 19,967 cases of flu-like syndrome were analyzed according to the result of the COVID-19 test. Predictive variables were: age range, sex, women in puerperium, presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hematological illness, immunodeficiencies, neurological diseases, obesity, renal diseases, and Down's syndrome. Robust Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratios of COVID-19. The research was reported via STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. RESULT(S): The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population was 10.37%. In the final model, the following variables were associated with COVID-19: aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes. CONCLUSION(S): among the flu-like syndrome cases, COVD-19 prevalence was high. In the Ceara State, clinical factors such as aged people, male sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can enhance the prevalence of COVID-19 by up to 2.57 times. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The identification of factors that are associated with the enhanced prevalence of COVID-19 facilitates early diagnosis, adequate and prompt treatment. This knowledge may avoid an unfavorable prognosis of the disease.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic since it emerged in December, 2019. Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 with the first 2-3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4-10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31/40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/ml, within 1-2 weeks in the second month and then sustained around 100 AU/ml until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid converted to negative (p=0.002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs. late recovery stage, n=16, p=0.003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7-77.0%). Our results suggested the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovery patients may have robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half arises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of humoral immune response in the future period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing vaccine.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by asymptomatic and presymptomatic persons poses important challenges to controlling spread of the disease, particularly in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities (1). On March 29, 2020, a staff member in a correctional and detention facility in Louisiana developed symptoms  and later had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. During April 2-May 7, two additional cases were detected among staff members, and 36 cases were detected among incarcerated and detained persons at the facility; these persons were removed from dormitories and isolated, and the five dormitories that they had resided in before diagnosis were quarantined. On May 7, CDC and the Louisiana Department of Health initiated an investigation to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incarcerated and detained persons residing in quarantined dormitories. Goals of this investigation included evaluating COVID-19 symptoms in this setting and assessing the effectiveness of serial testing to identify additional persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of efforts to mitigate transmission. During May 7-21, testing of 98 incarcerated and detained persons residing in the five quarantined dormitories (A-E) identified an additional 71 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 32 (45%) were among persons who reported no symptoms at the time of testing, including three who were presymptomatic. Eighteen cases (25%) were identified in persons who had received negative test results during previous testing rounds. Serial testing of contacts from shared living quarters identified persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who would not have been detected by symptom screening alone or by testing at a single time point.

{"text": "Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Narrative Review. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were observed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has been suspected that infected persons who remain asymptomatic play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, but their relative number and effect have been uncertain. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40% to 45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may be associated with subclinical lung abnormalities, as detected by computed tomography. Because of the high risk for silent spread by asymptomatic persons, it is imperative that testing programs include those without symptoms. To supplement conventional diagnostic testing, which is constrained by capacity, cost, and its one-off nature, innovative tactics for public health surveillance, such as crowdsourcing digital wearable data and monitoring sewage sludge, might be helpful.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Since the first occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a number of online tools have become available to assist with tracking Covid-19 prevalence. Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. Method(s): We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. Result(s): The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population.

BACKGROUND: As of April 18, 2020, over 2,000,000 patients had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) globally, and more than 140,000 deaths had been reported. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been documented recently. However, information on pediatric patients is limited. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric patients to provide valuable insight into the early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 in children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, observational study involves a case series performed at 4 hospitals in West China. Thirty-four pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 27 to February 23, 2020. The final follow-up visit was completed by March 16, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed for 34 pediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, interquartile range 10.00-94.25), among whom 14 males (41%) were included. All the patients in the current study presented mild (18%) or moderate (82%) forms of COVID-19. A total of 48% of patients were noted to be without a history of exposure to an identified source. Mixed infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients (18%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76%) and cough (62%). Expectoration (21%), vomiting (12%), and diarrhea (12%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A substantial increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (among 20 patients with available data; 85%) and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (among 29 patients with available data; 59%), whereas a decrease in prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (among 32 patients with available data; 78%). In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers.

Importance: On February 27, 2020, the first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. Objective(s): To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Kluytmans-van den Bergh MFQ et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

It is also unclear whether the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers durable protection against reinfection. This study will assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in the Eastern Cape (EC) and examine the longitudinal changes (rate of decay) in the antibody levels after infection in this cohort. Using a multi-stage cluster sampling of healthcare workers in selected health facilities in the EC, a cross-sectional study of 2250 participants will be recruited. In order to assess the community infection rate, 750 antenatal women in the same settings will be recruited. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) will be used for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. A nested cohort study will be conducted by performing eight-weekly antibody assays (X2) from 201 participants who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Logistic regression models will be fitted to identify the independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and infection fatality rate among the frontline HCWs will be estimated. In addition, the study will highlight the overall effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures (IPC) per exposure sites/wards at the selected health facilities.

Farber and colleagues report distinct antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric cohorts, including those who developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and adult COVID-19 cohorts. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age(1,2). Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)(3-5). Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department early in the pandemic. Method(s): Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Result(s): 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40 +/- 14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28 +/- 18 days), viral shedding (31 +/- 10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51), and work absence (29 +/- 28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response Higher IgG indexes were observed in individuals over 50 years of age (14.5 +/- 7.7 vs. 5.0 +/- 4.4, p = 0.012).

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in children - Understanding the immune responses and controlling the pandemic. In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection. With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention. A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 21 June 2020. Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific region there are few new cases reported daily.

{"text": "Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers during a period of diminished community prevalence of COVID-19. Previously, we showed that 3% (31/1032)of asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) from a large teaching hospital in Cambridge, UK, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in April 2020. About 15% (26/169) HCWs with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Rivett et al., 2020). Here, we show that the proportion of both asymptomatic and symptomatic HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 rapidly declined to near-zero between 25th April and 24th May 2020, corresponding to a decline in patient admissions with COVID-19 during the ongoing UK 'lockdown'. These data demonstrate how infection prevention and control measures including staff testing may help prevent hospitals from becoming independent 'hubs' of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and illustrate how, with appropriate precautions, organizations in other sectors may be able to resume on-site work safely.

Background: A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms. Method(s): We recruited adult (>=18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine. Finding(s): On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2-8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57-99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57-99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27-81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35-88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period. Interpretation(s): Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is driving a present day global pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are regarded as a high-risk cohort. The following is a short report on COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients (n = 5) from a high volume UK liver transplant unit with a large follow-up cohort (n = 4500). Based on this limited data, liver transplant recipients appear to have a low incidence of COVID-19, with less severe symptoms than expected, when compared with the general population and other solid organ recipients.

The present article aims to analyze epidemiologic aspects of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) over different countries across the globe. While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population adjusted number of cases and mortality rates were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination was negatively associated with population adjusted caseloads and mortality rates due to COVID-19.

{"text": "UV, ozone, and COVID-19 transmission in Ontario, Canada using generalised linear models. Background: Quantifying the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 transmission is crucial in preventing more cases. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozone (O3) have reported antimicrobial properties but few studies have examined associations with community infectivity of COVID-19. Research suggests UV light can be preventative while the effect of O3 is contested. We sought to determine the relationship between UV, O3, and COVID-19 incidence in Ontario, Canada. Method(s): In our time series analyses, we calculated daily incidence rates and reproductive number (Rt) from 34,975 cases between January and June 2020 across 34 Ontario Public Health Units. We used generalised linear models, adjusting for potential confounders, to calculate point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UV and O3. Analyses were further stratified by age groups and outbreaks at institutions versus community. Result(s): We found that 1-week averaged UV was significantly associated with a 13% decrease (95% CI: 0.80-0.96) in overall COVID-19 Rt, per unit increase. A negative association with UV was also significant among community outbreaks (PE: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) but not institutional outbreaks (PE: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.03). A positive association of O3 with COVID-19 incidence is strongly suggested among institutional outbreak cases (PE: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.13). Conclusion(s): Our study found evidence to support the hypothesis that higher UV reduced transmission of COVID-19 and some evidence that ground-level O3 positively influenced COVID-19 transmission. Setting of infection should be strongly considered as a factor in future research. UV and O3 may explain some of COVID-19's seasonal behaviour.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

First published September 24, 2020; doi:10.1152/physrev.00024.2020.-There are many unknowns for pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management. Besides the direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic adversely affect maternal health, including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain, and increased socioeconomic deprivation.

{"text": "COVID-19 patients in intensive care develop predominantly oliguric acute kidney injury. Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk. Method(s): In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP-2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission. The majority (n = 51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n = 37, 65%), whereas stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30-day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n = 9 (17%) patients.

Background: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have an excess of inflammation and increased concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1). We aimed to determine whether anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, could improve outcomes in patients in hospital with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Method(s): In this multicentre, open-label, Bayesian randomised clinical trial (CORIMUNO-ANA-1), nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort, we recruited patients from 16 University hospitals in France with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen by mask or nasal cannula but without ventilation assistance, a score of 5 on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS), and a C-reactive protein serum concentration of more than 25 mg/L not requiring admission to the intensive care unit at admission to hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based secure centralised system, stratified by centre and blocked with varying block sizes (randomly of size two or four), to either usual care plus anakinra (200 mg twice a day on days 1-3, 100 mg twice on day 4, 100 mg once on day 5) or usual care alone. Usual care was provided at the discretion of the site clinicians. The two coprimary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had died or needed non-invasive or mechanical ventilation by day 4 (ie, a score of >5 on the WHO-CPS) and survival without need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen) at day 14. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341584, and is now closed to accrual. Finding(s): Between April 8 and April 26, 2020, we screened 153 patients. The study was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, after the recruitment of 116 patients: 59 were assigned to the anakinra group, and 57 were assigned to the usual care group. Two patients in the usual care group withdrew consent and were not analysed. In the analysable population, the median age was 66 years (IQR 59 to 76) and 80 (70%) participants were men. In the anakinra group, 21 (36%) of 59 patients had a WHO-CPS score of more than 5 at day 4 versus 21 (38%) of 55 in the usual care group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -2.5%, 90% credible interval [CrI] -17.1 to 12.0), with a posterior probability of ARD of less than 0 (ie, anakinra better than usual care) of 61.2%. At day 14, 28 (47%; 95% CI 33 to 59) patients in the anakinra group and 28 (51%; 95% CI 36 to 62) in the usual care group needed ventilation or died, with a posterior probability of any efficacy of anakinra (hazard ratio [HR] being less than 1) of 54.5% (median posterior HR 0.97; 90% CrI 0.62 to 1.52). At day 90, 16 (27%) patients in the anakinra group and 15 (27%) in the usual care group had died.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created disruptions and stressors which may have influenced alcohol consumption frequency trends. Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence., METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from Understanding America Study (N=6,172 unique participants; N=28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modelled interaction by COVID-19 burden, defined as if the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance., RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR=1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster relative to those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002).

The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of the national lockdown in Iran. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to compare relative search volumes (RSVs) between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists' density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water using linear regression., RESULTS: When comparing 2020 with the previous four years, there was a rise of 2020 RSVs versus all previous years combined and each year (P < 0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B = - 3.29, 95% CI: (- 5.80, - 0.78), P = 0.012) had a strong negative relationship with provincial RSVs.

{"text": "Dysregulation of the Leukocyte Signaling Landscape during Acute COVID-19. The global COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 450,000 US citizens. Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated local tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells and was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels. High levels of STAT3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-gamma production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus in a dose dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 mug/ml iota-carrageenan. Experiments with patient isolated wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus showed an inhibition of replication in a similar range. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and endemic Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction of severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus and replication competent SARS-CoV-2 suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent comorbidities identified in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This article aims to discuss the pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of diabetes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Areas covered: We discussed various aspects of pharmacotherapeutic management in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: (i) susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 among individuals with diabetes, (ii) glycemic goals for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes, (iii) pharmacological treatment considerations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and concurrent diabetes. Expert opinion: The glycemic goals in patients with COVID-19 and concurrent type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are to avoid disruption of stable metabolic state, maintain optimal glycemic control, and prevent adverse glycemic events. Patients with T1DM require insulin therapy at all times to prevent ketosis. The management strategies for patients with T2DM include temporary discontinuation of certain oral antidiabetic agents and consideration for insulin therapy. Patients with T2DM who are relatively stable and able to eat regularly may continue with oral antidiabetic agents if glycemic control is satisfactory.

All of the infectious nasal-OP samples (culture positive on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells) had a matched SARS-CoV-2 positive oral fluid sample., Conclusions: In this study of nonhospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected persons, we demonstrate lower diagnostic sensitivity of self-collected oral fluid compared with nasal-OP specimens, a difference that was especially prominent more than 5 days from symptom onset. These data do not justify the routine use of oral fluid collection for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 despite the greater ease of collection. It also underscores the importance of considering the method of saliva specimen collection and the time from symptom onset especially in outpatient populations. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Background: Concerns have emerged about the higher risk of fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cancer patients. In this article, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center., Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days., Results: Among 9842 patients treated at Institut Curie between March 13 and May 1, 2020, 141 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing and/or computerized tomography scan. In line with our case mix, breast cancer (40.4%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies. Patients with active cancer therapy or/and advanced cancer accounted for 87.9% and 68.9% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 78.7% of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement inferior to 50% in 95.8% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48.2% and 6.4% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18.4%) have died from COVID-19, and 100 (70.9%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation., Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population.

The Northern region has the second highest incidence coefficient, as well as the third highest mortality rate in the country. This study aimed to investigate information about the evolutionary history of epidemic spread and genetic aspects of strains isolated on the Western Amazon, in the State of Rondonia, Brazil. It was possible to detect a total of 22 mutations. Some of these alterations may possibly be related to effects on transmissibility, the fidelity of RNA replication, the ability of cancer patients to respond to infection, beyond a mutation that emerged after the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Rondonia. At least two events of introduction were detected, corresponding to the B.1 and B.1.1 European lineages. An introduction was observed possibly through Argentina, where strains originated that circulated in the Minas Gerais and Ceara Brazilian states, prior to Rondonia (B.1.), as well as through the Minas Gerais state and the Federal District, which gave rise to strains that spread to Rondonia, from the capital to more rural parts of the state (B.1.1.).

The formation of biomolecular coronas around nanoparticles as soon as they come in contact with biological media is nowadays well accepted. The self-developed biological outer surfaces can affect the targeting capability of the colloidal carriers as well as their cytotoxicity and cellular uptake behavior. In this framework, we explored the structural features and biological consequences of protein coronas around block copolymer assemblies consisting of a common pH-responsive core made by poly[2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDPA) and hydrophilic shells of different chemical natures: zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) or highly hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) (PHPMA). We demonstrated the presence of ~50 nm protein coronas around the nanoparticles regardless of the chemical nature of the polymeric shells. The thickness is understood as the sum of the soft and hard layers and it is the actual interface seen by the cells. Although the soft corona composition is difficult to determine because the proteins are loosely bound to the outer surface of the assemblies, the tightly bound proteins (hard corona) could be identified and quantified. The compositional analysis of the hard corona demonstrated that human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and fibrinogen are the main components of the protein coronas, and serotransferrin is present particularly in the protein corona of the zwitterionic-stabilized assemblies. The protein coronas substantially reduce the cellular uptake of the colloidal particles due to their increased size and the presence of HSA which is known to reduce nanoparticle-cell adhesion. On the other hand, their existence also reduces the levels of cytotoxicity of the polymeric assemblies, highlighting that protein coronas should not be always understood as artifacts that need to be eliminated due to their positive outputs.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Ruxolitinib (Rux), a selective oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor, is efficacious in COVID-19 by reducing inflammation via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. MethodsHere, we investigated whether JAK2 inhibition has neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke (IS) in MCAO mice in vivo and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, and explored the potential molecular mechanisms. Rux was applied to MCAO mice. Immunofluorescence staining, RT-qPCR, and western blots were used to measure the expression of NLRP3 inflammation components and proinflammatory cytokines as well as JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Local STAT3 deficiency in brain tissue was established to investigate the interplay between NLRP3 and STAT3 signaling.ResultsRux treatment obviously improved neurological scores, decreased the infarct size and ameliorated cerebral edema 3 days after stroke. In addition, immunofluorescence staining and western blots showed that Rux application inhibited the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, proteins related to the NLRP3 inflammasome and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in neurons.

{"text": "Country differences in transmissibility, age distribution and case-fatality of SARS-CoV-2: a global ecological analysis. <h4>Introduction</h4> SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the world yet the first pandemic waves in many low-income countries appeared milder than initially forecasted through mathematical models. Hypotheses for this observed difference include under-ascertainment of cases and deaths, country population age structure, and immune modulation secondary to exposure to endemic parasitic infections. We conducted a country-level ecological study to describe patterns in key SARS-CoV-2 outcomes by country and region and to explore possible associations of the potential explanatory factors with these outcomes. <h4>Methods</h4> We collected publicly available data at country level and compared them using standardisation techniques. We then explored the association between exposures and outcomes using alternative approaches: random forest (RF) regression and linear (LM) regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and plausible effect modifications. <h4>Results</h4> Altogether, data on the mean time-varying reproduction number (mean R t ) were available for 153 countries, but standardised averages for the age of cases and deaths and for the case-fatality ratio (CFR) could only be computed for 61, 39 and 31 countries respectively. While mean R t was highest in the WHO Europe and Americas regions, median age of death was lower in the Africa region even after standardisation, with broadly similar CFR. Population age was strongly associated with mean R t and the age-standardised median age of observed cases and deaths in both RF and LM models. The models highlighted other plausible roles of population density, testing intensity and co-morbidity prevalence, but yielded uncertain results as regards exposure to common parasitic infections. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The average age of a population seems to be an important country-level factor explaining both transmissibility and the median age of observed cases and deaths, even after age-standardisation. Potential associations between endemic infections and COVID-19 are worthy of further exploration but seem unlikely, from this analysis, to be key drivers of the variation in observed COVID-19 epidemic trends. Our study was limited by the availability of outcome data and its causally uncertain ecological design, with the observed distribution of age amongst reported cases and deaths suggesting key differences in surveillance and testing strategy and capacity by country and the representativeness of case reporting of infection. Research at subnational and individual level is needed to explore hypotheses further.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: As the world is busy addressing COVID-19, road traffic injuries, another major cause of death is continuously killing people on the roads. In Nepal, there were frequent media reports of occurrences of road crashes, injuries, and deaths despite nationwide lockdown. This paper aims to describe the situation of road traffic crashes and casualties during the period of complete lockdown. Method(s): This study used secondary data from two sources: Nepal Police and media reports between 24 March and 14 June 2020 (because the government lifted the nationwide lockdown from 15 June 2020). Available details of crashes, deaths, and injuries for this period were extracted from media reports and the summary data that was obtained from the Police. We have included data from both sources in the results. Result(s): Nepal Police recorded 1,801 incidents of road crashes during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown with 256 deaths (on average 3.1 deaths daily) and 1,824 injuries (on average 22.2 injuries daily). Motorcycles comprised over 21% of all vehicles involved in crashes. Ambulances and other vehicles for essential services were also found to be involved in crashes. Speeding itself was the cause for almost a quarter of the incidents during the lockdown. Conclusion(s): Although a reduction in the number of road crashes and related injuries and fatalities was observed, this reduction was not as substantial as anticipated during the heavy restrictions on vehicular movement imposed during the lockdown. Media reports were mainly found to be reporting the crashes where deaths occurred, but police records also included nonfatal injuries.

{"text": "HLA binding of self-peptides is biased towards proteins with specific molecular functions. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is highly polymorphic and plays a key role in guiding adaptive immune responses by presenting foreign and self peptides to T cells. Each HLA variant selects a minor fraction of peptides that match a certain motif required for optimal interaction with the peptide-binding groove. These restriction rules define the landscape of peptides presented to T cells. Given these limitations, one might suggest that the choice of peptides presented by HLA is non-random and there is preferential presentation of an array of peptides that is optimal for distinguishing self and foreign proteins. In this study we explore these preferences with a comparative analysis of self peptides enriched and depleted in HLA ligands. We show that HLAs exhibit preferences towards presenting peptides from certain proteins while disfavoring others with specific functions, and highlight differences between various HLA genes and alleles in those preferences. We link those differences to HLA anchor residue propensities and amino acid composition of preferentially presented proteins. The set of proteins that peptides presented by a given HLA are most likely to be derived from can be used to distinguish between class I and class II HLAs and HLA alleles. Our observations can be extrapolated to explain the protective effect of certain HLA alleles in infectious diseases, and we hypothesize that they can also explain susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. We demonstrate that these differences lead to differential presentation of HIV, influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins by various HLA alleles. Finally, we show that the reported self peptidome preferences of distinct HLA variants can be compensated by combinations of HLA-A/HLA-B and HLA-A/HLA-C alleles in frequent haplotypes.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "E484K mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhances binding affinity with hACE2 but reduces interactions with neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies: Binding free energy calculation studies. The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 100 million infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective vaccine development and antibody drugs design.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Massive worldwide serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 is needed to determine the extent of virus exposure in a particular region, the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infected persons, and the duration and extent of immunity after infection. To achieve this, the development and production of reliable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 antigens is critical. We report the bacterial production of the peptide S-RBDN318-V510, which contains the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (region of 193 amino acid residues from asparagine-318 to valine-510) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We purified this peptide using a straightforward approach involving bacterial lysis, his-tag-mediated affinity chromatography, and imidazole-assisted refolding. The antigen performances of S-RBDN318-V510 and a commercial full-length spike protein were compared in ELISAs. In direct ELISAs, where the antigen was directly bound to the ELISA surface, both antigens discriminated sera from non-exposed and exposed individuals. However, the discriminating resolution was better in ELISAs that used the full-spike antigen than the S-RBDN318-V510. Attachment of the antigens to the ELISA surface using a layer of anti-histidine antibodies gave equivalent resolution for both S-RBDN318-V510 and the full-length spike protein. Results demonstrate that ELISA-functional SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be produced in bacterial cultures, and that S-RBDN318-V510 may represent a cost-effective alternative to the use of structurally more complex antigens in serological COVID-19 testing.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group., RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000). RSV was the most common cause of medically attended ARI among children aged 1-4 years; coronaviruses were the most common among adults aged >=65 years., CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other studies focused on single viruses, we found that influenza and RSV were major causes of acute respiratory illness in persons of all ages.

To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a severe global health problem affecting almost every country in the world. Compared to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be more infectious thereby leading to a rapid spread of this disease across the world. The effective control of this disease relies on timely diagnosis, proper isolation, contact tracing of the infected people and segregation of vulnerable group from potential contamination. Currently, the gold standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, NPS collection has several shortcomings. Besides requiring an active involvement of healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), NPS collection is uncomfortable for the patient as it can induce coughing, gagging, vomiting and even bleeding. Evidence from current studies indicates that saliva has a potential to be useful as an alternative biological sample for COVID-19 diagnosis. Indeed, saliva as a biological sample offers several advantages over NPS. Saliva collection is better accepted by patients, it can be self-collected and does not require PPE and active involvement of healthcare personnel. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis is similar to that of NPS.

Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC., RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC., CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers.

{"text": "Homologous and heterologous serological response to the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>SUMMARY</h4> The increasing numbers of infected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious threats to public health and the global economy. Most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target the receptor binding domain (RBD) and some the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which is the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2. While the antibody response to RBD has been extensively characterized, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the NTD protein are less well studied. Using 227 plasma samples from COVID-19 patients, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NTD-specific antibodies could be induced during infection. As compared to the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 NTD response is less cross-reactive with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies are rarely elicited in a mice model when NTD is used as an immunogen. We subsequently demonstrate that NTD has an altered antigenicity when expressed alone. Overall, our results suggest that while NTD offers an alternative strategy for serology testing, it may not be suitable as an immunogen for vaccine development.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Vaccine Design, Adaptation, and Cloning Design for Multiple Epitope-Based Vaccine Derived From SARS-CoV-2 Surface Glycoprotein (S), Membrane Protein (M) and Envelope Protein (E): In silico approach. The SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become a global epidemic that has increased the scientific community's concern about developing and finding a counteraction against this lethal virus. So far, hundreds of thousands of people have been infected by the pandemic due to contamination and spread. This research was therefore carried out to develop potential epitope-based vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. Three potential vaccine constructs were designed after intensive computational experimentation, and one vaccine model was chosen as the best vaccine based on a molecular docking analysis that is intended to work efficiently against SARS-CoV-2. In order to verify biological stability and find an appropriate mass production technique for the chosen vaccine, molecular dynamics simulation, and silico codon adaptation studies were subsequently carried out. This study should help to maintain current research efforts to secure a definitive preventive measure against this contagious disease.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A Multiscale Multicellular Spatiotemporal Model of Local Influenza Infection and Immune Response. Respiratory viral infections pose a serious public health concern, from mild seasonal influenza to pandemics like those of SARS-CoV-2. Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral infection impact nearly all aspects of the progression of a viral infection, like the dependence of viral replication rates on the type of cell and pathogen, the strength of the immune response and localization of infection. Mathematical modeling is often used to describe respiratory viral infections and the immune response to them using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. However, ODE models neglect spatially-resolved biophysical mechanisms like lesion shape and the details of viral transport, and so cannot model spatial effects of a viral infection and immune response. In this work, we develop a multiscale, multicellular spatiotemporal model of influenza infection and immune response by combining non-spatial ODE modeling and spatial, cell-based modeling. We employ cellularization, a recently developed method for generating spatial, cell-based, stochastic models from non-spatial ODE models, to generate much of our model from a calibrated ODE model that describes infection, death and recovery of susceptible cells and innate and adaptive responses during influenza infection, and develop models of cell migration and other mechanisms not explicitly described by the ODE model. We determine new model parameters to generate agreement between the spatial and original ODE models under certain conditions, where simulation replicas using our model serve as microconfigurations of the ODE model, and compare results between the models to investigate the nature of viral exposure and impact of heterogeneous infection on the time-evolution of the viral infection. We found that using spatially homogeneous initial exposure conditions consistently with those employed during calibration of the ODE model generates far less severe infection, and that local exposure to virus must be multiple orders of magnitude greater than a uniformly applied exposure to all available susceptible cells. This strongly suggests a prominent role of localization of exposure in influenza A infection. We propose that the particularities of the microenvironment to which a virus is introduced plays a dominant role in disease onset and progression, and that spatially resolved models like ours may be important to better understand and more reliably predict future health states based on susceptibility of potential lesion sites using spatially resolved patient data of the state of an infection. We can readily integrate the immune response components of our model into other modeling and simulation frameworks of viral infection dynamics that do detailed modeling of other mechanisms like viral internalization and intracellular viral replication dynamics, which are not explicitly represented in the ODE model. We can also combine our model with available experimental data and modeling of exposure scenarios and spatiotemporal aspects of mechanisms like mucociliary clearance that are only implicitly described by the ODE model, which would significantly improve the ability of our model to present spatially resolved predictions about the progression of influenza infection and immune response.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PIMS-TS) has been defined by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health as 'a child presenting with persistent fever, inflammation and evidence of single or multi-organ dysfunction' (https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/guidance-paediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-synd rome-temporally-associated-covid-19-pims). We describe the skin manifestations in 17 paediatric patients presenting from 14 March to 18 May 2020 to a single institution with features of PIMS-TS. Common presenting symptoms in these 17 children included fever, rash and gastrointestinal symptoms. Less common presentations included cough, epistaxis, arthralgia, headache and respiratory symptoms and were only present in one patient. Median age at presentation was 11 years (range 1-16), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.8 : 1.The majority of patients were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME); nine were of Afro-Caribbean descent, three were white, two were Turkish, one was Albanian, one was Indian and one was Hispanic. Within this group, nine (53%) presented with a skin rash, eight (47%) with conjunctival involvement and three (18%) with cheilitis. The time of onset of cutaneous disease was variable, but most patients presented with a rash at admission or within a few days of admission. The rash was polymorphous, but the most common skin presentations were a maculopapular eruption and fixed urticaria, particularly on the trunk and limbs. In addition, acral presentations were seen with erythematous oedematous ears and fingers. The but it may represent an antibody or immune complexmediated postinfectious inflammatory syndrome (Verdoni L, Mazza A, Gervasoni A et al. An outbreak of a severe Kawasaki -like disease at the Italian epicentre of the SARS CoV-2 epidemic: an observational cohort study. Lancet 2020; Epub ahead of print). As dermatologists collate databases of images and histopathology of skin disease with this new virus, SARS-CoV-2, a clearer picture of the pathophysiology of this disease should emerge. We propose that in any child presenting with persistent fever, rash and evidence of systemic inflammation, PIMS-TS should be considered, and urgent specialist referral sought, in light of the serious cardiac complications that may arise. Further investigation is needed into the apparent higher rate of PIMS-TS in BAME children and the association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein enhances the infectivity of lentiviral spike particles. The establishment of SARS CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral (LV) systems has enabled the rapid identification of entry inhibitors and neutralizing agents, alongside allowing for the study of this emerging pathogen in BSL-2 level facilities. While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that this augmentation by N renders LV spike particles less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Biochemical analysis revealed that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of SARS CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is achieved without a concomitant increase in sensitivity towards RBD binding-based neutralization. Our results hold important implications for the design and interpretation of similar LV pseudotyping-based studies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression.

Purpose: To determine whether the incidence of chalazion increased significantly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County following the widespread adoption of face mask wear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic., Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter study of two ophthalmology institutions: a private Oculoplastics practice in San Francisco and the Oculoplastics division of the Stein Eye Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. All patients seen during the studied time periods with a diagnosis of chalazion or hordeolum were identified through review of electronic medical records and included in the study. Incidence was determined for each month between January and August 2020, and compared to data from prior years via ANOVA to evaluate for changes after the onset of the pandemic., Results: In San Francisco, the incidence of chalazion rose significantly in June through August of 2020 when compared to the same interval in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In Los Angeles, the rise in chalazion incidence in 2020 was also statistically significant when compared to data from the years 2018 and 2019., Conclusion: Importance: Widespread mask wear does appear to correspond to an increased incidence of chalazion.

BACKGROUND: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) are commencing their 54th season of collaboration at a time when SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be cocirculating with the usual winter infections., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct surveillance of influenza and other monitored respiratory conditions and to report on vaccine uptake and effectiveness using nationally representative surveillance data extracted from primary care computerized medical records systems. We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research., METHODS: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval., RESULTS: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded. We are implementing a central swab distribution system for patients self-swabbing at home in addition to in-practice sampling. We have converted all our primary care coding to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) coding. Throughout spring and summer 2020, the network has continued to collect specimens in preparation for the winter or for any second wave of COVID-19 cases. We have collected 5404 swabs and detected 623 cases of COVID-19 through extended virological sampling, and 19,341 samples have been collected for serology. This shows our preparedness for the winter season., CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a groundswell of general practices joining our network.

The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD's receptor-binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some plasma is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in the emerging 20H/501Y.V2 and 20J/501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Targeted delivery of doxorubicin still poses a challenge with regards to the quantities reaching the target site as well as the specificity of the uptake. In the present approach, two colloidal nanocarrier systems, NanoCore-6.4 and NanoCore-7.4, loaded with doxorubicin and characterized by different drug release behaviors were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The nanoparticles utilize a specific surface design to modulate the lipid corona by attracting blood-borne apolipoproteins involved in the endogenous transport of chylomicrons across the blood-brain barrier. When applying this strategy, the fine balance between drug release and carrier accumulation is responsible for targeted delivery. Drug release experiments in an aqueous medium resulted in a difference in drug release of approximately 20%, while a 10% difference was found in human serum. This difference affected the partitioning of doxorubicin in human blood and was reflected by the outcome of the pharmacokinetic study in rats. For the fast-releasing formulation NanoCore-6.4, the AUC0->1h was significantly lower (2999.1 ng x h/mL) than the one of NanoCore-7.4 (3589.5 ng x h/mL). A compartmental analysis using the physiologically-based nanocarrier biopharmaceutics model indicated a significant difference in the release behavior and targeting capability. A fraction of approximately 7.310-7.615% of NanoCore-7.4 was available for drug targeting, while for NanoCore-6.4 only 5.740-6.057% of the injected doxorubicin was accumulated.

The proposed model incorporates both asymptomatic infectious and hospitalized infectious subpopulations to the standard infectious subpopulation of the classical SEIR model. In parallel, it also incorporates feedback vaccination and antiviral treatment controls. The exposed subpopulation has three different transitions to the three kinds of infectious subpopulations under eventually different proportionality parameters. The existence of a unique disease-free equilibrium point and a unique endemic one is proved together with the calculation of their explicit components. Their local asymptotic stability properties and the attainability of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated based on the next generation matrix properties, the value of the basic reproduction number, and nonnegativity properties of the solution and its equilibrium states. The reproduction numbers in the presence of one or both controls is linked to the control-free reproduction number to emphasize that such a number decreases with the control gains.

A study documented the prevalence of stroke ranging from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43%, and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. The numbers of these NCD cases are predicted to rise over the next decade. However, in the context of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, with the rising cases, lockdowns and deaths recorded worldwide, many people living with NCDs may find accessing care more difficult. The majority of the available resources on the subcontinent have been diverted to focus on the ongoing pandemic. This has caused interruptions in care, complication management, drug pick-up alongside the almost neglected silent NCD epidemic, with major consequences for the health system post the COVID-19 era. We explore the issues surrounding the continuity of care and offer some solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Thyroid Function Analysis in 50 Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Study. Background: Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, it has affected >200 countries, areas, or territories in 6 continents. At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Method(s): Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. Result(s): TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups. Conclusion(s): The changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19.\u00a9 Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Expert opinion in Alzheimer disease: The silent scream of patients and their family during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be the greatest challenge for mental health since World War II in general, but the toll exacted on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family is the greatest in several respects. AD patients are at the highest risk for contagion and death from the disease, but also at the very bottom in the list of priorities to access critical care services at times of medical resource scarcity. In this communication we examine the impact of the pandemic on AD patients and their family from the general medical, neurological, and mental health perspectives. We propose that instances of undue restriction of access to care based upon age and diagnosis show that society, governments, and health professionals need to exert maximum care, human compassion, and adherence to original Hippocratic values when addressing the needs of persons with AD and other major neurocognitive disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that psychiatry is called to contribute to societal measures oriented to diminish human burden in this population.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A retrospective study was performed to verify if the number of admissions for urgent dental care in the Urgent Dental Care Service of San Paolo Hospital in Milan (Italy) was directly related to the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Different periods were analyzed: March 25-April 5, 2019 (pre-COVID); March 23-April 3, 2020 (lockdown); June 8-June 19, 2020 (reopening); and November 9-November 20 (second wave). Raw data regarding admissions, diagnoses, and treatments were extracted. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. The survey included 901 admissions, 285 in pre-COVID, 93 during lockdown, 353 in reopening, and 170 in the second wave. In each time period, statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of each kind of diagnoses (X2(3) = 20.33 p = 0.01 for endodontic emergencies, X2(3) = 29.05 p < 0.01 for cellulitis/phlegmon, X2(3) = 28.55 p < 0.01 for periodontal emergencies, Fisher's Exact Test p < 0.01 for trauma, and X2(3) = 59.94 p < 0.01 for all other kinds of diagnosis). A remarkable increase in consultations (+186.36%) and other treatments (+90.63%) occurred during reopening. Tooth extraction was the most frequently delivered treatment, but suffered the largest reduction during lockdown (-79.82%).

{"text": "COVID-19 in people living with HIV: Clinical implications of dynamics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Little evidence on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people living with HIV (PLWH) is currently available. We reported clinical and viroimmunological data of all HIV-positive patients admitted to our center with COVID-19 from March 1 to May 12, 2020. Overall, five patients were included: all were virologically-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and CD4+ count was greater than 350 cell/mm3 in all but two patients. Although all patients had evidence of pneumonia on admission, only one developed respiratory failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was never detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in two patients, whereas in the others, viral clearance occurred within a maximum of 43 days. Immunoglobulin G production was elicited in all patients and neutralizing antibodies in all but one patient. Specific-T-cell response developed in all patients but was stronger in those with the more severe presentations. Similarly, the highest level of proinflammatory cytokines was found in the only patient experiencing respiratory failure. Despite a mild presentation, patients with more pronounced immunosuppression showed high degrees of both cytokines production and immune activation. Our study did not find an increased risk and severity of COVID-19 in PLWH. Adaptative cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appeared to correlate to disease severity. The mild clinical picture showed in advanced HIV patients, despite a significant T-cell activation and inflammatory profile, suggests a potential role of HIV-driven immunological dysregulation in avoiding immune-pathogenetic processes. However, other possible explanations, as a protective role of certain antiretroviral drugs, should be considered. Further larger studies are needed to better clarify the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Only limited data describe the efforts to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. We describe our experience engaging persons recovered from COVID-19 to donate CCP. Study Design and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the CCP recruitment for an 11-hospital health system in Houston, Texas. We sought CCP donations from: a) \"volunteers\" responding to advertisements in social media, press releases, and websites and b) \"referred\" individuals directed to the program or identified from hospitalization records. We determined the proportions of donor candidates who passed initial telephone health screening, who qualified after diagnostic testing, who presented to the regional CCP donation center, and who completed CCP donation. Result(s): There were 900 CCP donor candidates, including 363 volunteers and 537 referred donors. Of 360 contacted volunteers, 186 (5.7%) were excluded by interview; 133 were referred for additional diagnostic screening, 97 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 87 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 35 CCP donations (9.7% of initial telephone contacts). Among 533 referred donors, 448 (84.1%) were excluded by interview, 71 were referred for additional screening, 48 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 40 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in one CCP donation (0.2% of initial telephone contacts).

Passive transfer of antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients is being used as an experimental treatment for eligible patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) guidelines for convalescent plasma initially recommended target antibody titers of 160. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera from recovered COVID-19 patients using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) at moderate (PRNT50) and high (PRNT90) stringency thresholds. We found that neutralizing activity significantly increased with time post symptom onset (PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having neutralizing titers of at least 160 was approximately 93% (PRNT50) and approximately 54% (PRNT90). Sera with high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (>960 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers) showed maximal activity, but not all high-titer sera contained neutralizing antibody at FDA recommended levels, particularly at high stringency. These results underscore the value of serum characterization for neutralization activity.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: In anticipation of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19's transmission peak, Eid-al-Fitr homecoming (mudik) has officially been banned by the Indonesian government interlocal but not local in welcoming this religious Muslim celebration. This local Mudik is held by traveling among regional provinces and is still allowed by each local government, including Java, which has the highest transmission of COVID-19 in Indonesia. AIM: This study aims to present the difference between COVID-19 status before and during local Mudik on Java during Ramadhan with the implementation of large-sale social distancing applied in Jakarta, Indonesia. METHOD(S): This research was employed by secondary data analysis that was obtained from surveillance data from related authorities, including the Ministry of Health and all local governments of Java, which consisted of four provinces and Jakarta. Incidence and suspect statuses of COVID-19, which were examined in the study, were presented in daily rates with before and during local Mudik in four provinces: Jawa Barat, Yogyakarta, Banten, and Jawa Tengah. RESULT(S): The number of positive confirmed patients differed significantly with before and during local Mudik (p < 0.05; mean difference = -/negative values). CONCLUSION(S): This study's findings showed that the local Mudik increased the number of COVID-19 cases in four provinces in Java, which these provinces were designated as Mudik destinations by travelers coming from Jakarta during the end of Ramadhan season.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Meita Veruswati, Al Asyary, Rony Darmawansyah Alnur, Guspianto Guspianto.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Purpose: We assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for ischemic heart disease during the lockdown imposed by the Italian Government. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the number and the findings of stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI performed between February and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic at the University of Napoli Federico II. The number and the findings of stress SPECT-MPI studies acquired in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 were also evaluated for direct comparison. Result(s): The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 123) was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) compared with the mean yearly number of procedures performed in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (n = 413). Yet, the percentage of abnormal stress SPECT-MPI studies was similar (P = 0.65) during the pandemic (36%) compared with the mean percentage value of the corresponding period of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (34%). Conclusion(s): The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding months of the previous 3 years.

{"text": "Willingness to Adopt mHealth Among Chinese Parents During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study. BACKGROUND: Parental involvement in mobile health (mHealth) to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with the rapid development of the internet. More parents with busy jobs have chosen to use mHealth. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, mHealth can assist with health promotion, directions for medication use, and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of mHealth in parents' attitudes toward child health care at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt mHealth among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. METHOD(S): Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from January 25 to February 15, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of 16 items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes toward child health care at home. By multivariate logistic regression, we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. RESULT(S): A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents' duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; >6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing (chi26=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing (chi26=45.364, P<.001), frequency of leaving the home (chi26=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (chi26=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (chi26=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children (chi26=63.810, P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): We found various objective factors that were associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the outbreak response measures on door-to-balloon time (D2B). This study examined both D2B and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Methods and Results:This was a retrospective study of 303 STEMI patients who presented directly or were transferred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for PPCI from October 2019 to March 2020. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients admitted before (BOR) and during (DOR) the COVID-19 outbreak response. The study outcomes were in-hospital death, D2B, cardiogenic shock and 30-day readmission. For direct presentations, fewer patients in the DOR group achieved D2B time <90 min compared with the BOR group (71.4% vs. 80.9%, P=0.042). This was more apparent after exclusion of non-system delay cases (DOR 81.6% vs. BOR 95.9%, P=0.006). Prevalence of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (9.5% vs. 1.9%, P=0.003) and acute mitral regurgitation (31.6% vs. 17.5%, P=0.006) was higher in the DOR group. Mortality was similar between groups. Multivariable regression showed that longer D2B time was an independent predictor of death (odds ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.011, P=0.029). CONCLUSION(S): The COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak response have had an adverse effect on PPCI service efficiency.

Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion in elderly people with moderate to severe COVID-19 living in a long-term care facility (LTCF)., Patients and Methods: Twenty-two consecutive elderly COVID-19 patients living in a LTCF in Lombardy (Italy) who were given CP during the period May 15-July 31, 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Their clinical, instrumental and laboratory parameters were assessed following the CP treatment. Overall mortality rate in this group was compared with that recorded in other LCTF in Lombardy during the 3-month period from March-May 2020., Results: Of the 22 patients enrolled, 68.2% (n=15) received one CP unit, 27.3% (n=6) received two units and 4.5% (n=1) received three units. Of the CP units transfused, 76.7% (23/30) had a neutralizing antibody titer >=1:160. No adverse reactions were recorded during or after CP administration. Improvements of clinical, functional, radiological and laboratory parameters during the 14 days following CP transfusion were observed in all 19 patients who survived. Viral clearance was achieved in all patients by the end of follow-up (median 66 days, IQR 48-80 days). The overall mortality rate was 13.6% (3/22), which compared favorably with that in the control group (38.3%, 281/733, P=0.02) and corresponded to a 65% reduction of mortality risk., Conclusion: Early administration of CP with an adequate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titer to elderly, symptomatic, COVID-19 patients in a LTCF was safe and effective in eliminating the virus, restoring patients' immunity and blocking the progression of COVID-19, thereby improving patients' survival.

Chile has one of the worst numbers worldwide in terms of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and COVID-19-related deaths per million inhabitants; thus, characterization of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in the general population is critical to understanding of immunity at the local level. Given our inability to perform massive classical neutralization assays due to the scarce availability of BSL-3 facilities in the country, we developed and fully characterized an HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, which was used in a 96-well plate format to investigate NAb responses in samples from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with convalescent plasma. We also identified samples with decreased or enhanced neutralization activity against the D614G spike variant compared with the wild type, indicating the relevance of this variant in host immunity.

The National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) stipulates that patients with pre-operative mortality risk <= 5% are admitted directly to critical care (level 2/3) postoperatively. We set out to establish the incidence of these high-risk patients being inappropriately transferred to level 1 care and improve pathways to reduce this occurrence. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted further iterations of pathway development, as all patients with peri-operative COVID-19 fall into a high-risk group [1]. Methods The study was conducted at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Data collection cycles 1 and 2 included patients who had NELA surgeries between 16/10/18 to 16/10/19 and 1/1/20 to 1/7/20, respectively. A new pathway was introduced between cycles and was subsequently modified to segregate patients by COVID-19 risk group. Data were extracted from the NELA database and electronic medical records, analysed using R (version 4.0.0) and are presented as median [IQR] or n (%). Results Cycle 1 included 152 patients and cycle 2 included 63. There was no difference in NELA risk score between cycles (p = 0.21), which was 8.3% [10-20] and 9.2% [12-30] in cycles 1 and 2, respectively. Thirty-day mortality was 7.9% in both cycles. Most deaths occurred in the high-risk group; 11/12 (91.7%) cycle 1 and 4/5 (80%) cycle 2. The proportion of high-risk patients transferred directly from theatre to critical care was unchanged; 70/77 (90.1%) and 25/27 (92.6%) in cycles 1 and 2, respectively (2 = 0.07, p = 0.79). All patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in cycle 2 (4/63) were transferred directly to level 3 care. Concerningly, a substantial number of patients, 17/63 (27%) in cycle 2, did not have NELA scores calculated at all. Discussion Our results demonstrate that the majority of patients with mortality risk <= 5% are admitted directly to critical care postoperatively; however, despite staff education and introduction of a new pathway, there remains a minority of high-risk patients transferred to level 1 beds. The elevated risk associated with peri-operative COVID-19 suggests that effective NELA pathways are more important than ever. Through collaboration between surgical, anaesthetic and ICU teams, the existing pathway has been developed to facilitate streaming by COVID-19 risk group. Further improvements, including automated NELA scoring via the electronic patient record and a NELA-specific World Health Organization (WHO) form mandating risk score before knife-to-skin, will launch later this month.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS. <h4>Methods:</h4> Data from 12 data-sources in 28 countries were aggregated. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes, hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. <h4>Results:</h4> 657 (28.1%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analysed. Older age, progressive MS-phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalisation (aOR=1.56,95%CI=1.01-2.41; aOR=2.43,95%CI=1.48-4.02) and ICU admission (aOR=2.30,95%CI=0.98-5.39; aOR=3.93,95%CI=1.56-9.89), though only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=4.00,95%CI=1.54-10.39).

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to recommend a fast and cost-effective screening procedure for UK/SA SARS-CoV-2 variants in a routing diagnostic setting., METHODS: A rapid procedure using qPCR is described to provide clinicians with information about the two currently most prevalent variants (B1.1.7 and B1.351) that harbour receptor binding domain mutation N501Y. The N501Y specific assay only delivers an amplification signal if the Y501 variant is present., RESULTS: 436 samples initially screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 were randomly selected. Only one of these samples showed a fluorescence signal increase indicative for the Y501 variant. The remaining 435 samples had a melting peak at 54 degreeC indicating the N501 wildtype., SIGNIFICANCE: The screening of a broad population base can still be performed with the established test system. In case of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding clinical and anamnestic indications, a second qPCR for the mutation N501Y can follow and deliver the result to public health authorities and to the treating physician within a few hours.

Sentinel animals remain a common means of evaluating rodent health in research colonies. An evaluation of our sentinelprogram revealed that using Crl:CD1(ICR)-Elite (CD1-E) mice was expensive, occasionally disrupted by limited supply, andminimally responsive to the 3Rs. This evaluation prompted us to explore the use of CRL:NU-Foxn1nu/+ (Het-nude) mice assoiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) animals. Het-nude mice are a byproduct of breeding outbred athymic nude mice and are reared in isolators, with similar health status as CD1-E. Het-nude mice have a thymus, but may have smaller thymic size and fewer bone marrow stem cells than do wildtype controls, suggesting that Het-nude mice might not be immunologically normal.This study compared the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of Het-nude and CD1-E SBS to murine norovirus (MNV)and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Het-nude and CD1-E female SBS (n = 22 mice of each stock) were housed continuously on soiled bedding collected from MNV-positive or MNV- and MHV-positive colonies at cage changes. Blood was collected for serology at 3, 9 and 12 to 19 wk after the start of soiled bedding exposure. Antibody titers to MNV or MHV did not differ significantly between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. A significant relationship was found between weeks of exposure and titer levels with an increase in titer over the testing period. This study supports the possible use of Het-nude mice as SBS, giventhat their antibody responses to MNV and MHV are equivalent to those of CD1-E mice.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Histopathology and ultrastructural findings of fatal COVID-19 infections on testis. Purpose: To evaluate the presence and analyze the pathological changes within the testes of patients who died or recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) complications. Material(s) and Method(s): Testis tissue was collected from autopsies of COVID-19 positive (n=6) and negative men (n=3). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to immunofluorescence for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression. Fluorescent-labeled tissue slides were imaged on a quantitative pathology scope with various zoom levels allowing for qualitative and quantitative interpretation. Tissue from four COVID-19 positive autopsy cases and a live seroconverted patient was imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Result(s): H&E histomorphology showed three of the six COVID-19 biopsies had normal spermatogenesis while the remaining three had impaired spermatogenesis. TEM showed the COVID-19 virus in testis tissue of one COVID-19 positive autopsy case and the live biopsy, H&E stain on the same autopsy case demonstrated interstitial macrophage and leukocyte infiltration. Immunofluorescent stained slides from six COVID-19 positive men demonstrated a direct association between increased quantitative ACE-2 levels and impairment of spermatogenesis. Conclusion(s): The novel COVID-19 has an affinity for ACE-2 receptors. Since ACE-2 receptor expression is high in the testes, we hypothesized that COVID-19 is prevalent in testes tissue of infected patients. This study suggests the male reproductive tract, specifically the testes, may be targets of COVID-19 infection. We found an inverse association between ACE-2 receptor levels and spermatogenesis, suggesting a possible mechanism of how COVID-19 can cause infertility.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 and the kidneys, implications and outcomes. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared as a pandemic has affected millions of people and caused unprecedented number of death. The disease is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses-2 virus which enters cells by binding with the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and CD147 protein. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital, hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common co-morbidities. A majority of COVID-19 hospitalized patients are found to have proteinuria and hematuria which is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Studies have reported high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital (10 to 43%) and intensive care unit (43-75%). These patients with AKI have much higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and critical care. In addition, proportion of patients with AKI who require renal replacement (RRT) therapy is greatly increased. Acute tubular injury, cytokine storm induced systemic inflammatory response, endothelial injury and dysfunction are the main mechanisms of AKI. In addition, direct viral invasion of tubules, lymphocytic infiltration and complement mediated (C5b-9) related injury is also seen. Mortality risk among patients with AKI and those in need of RRT is greatly amplified. Appropriate timing and choice of RRT for these patients is not well defined but will need to take in account the clinical condition, anticipation of their clinical course and availability of dialysis resources. Risk of AKI and death is also increased among kidney recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.Copyright \u00a9 2021, Iranian Society of Nephrology.

{"text": "Understanding Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Blacks. INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected communities of color, with blacks experiencing the highest rates of disease severity and mortality. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to reduce the race mortality gap from COVID-19; however, hesitancy of the vaccine in the black community threatens vaccine uptake., METHODS: We conducted focus groups with black barbershop and salon owners living in zip codes of elevated COVID-19 prevalence to assess their attitudes, beliefs, and norms around a COVID-19 vaccine. We used a modified grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts., RESULTS: We completed four focus groups (n=24 participants) in July and August 2020. Participants were an average age of 46, 89% were black non-Hispanic. Hesitancy against the COVID-19 vaccine was high due to mistrust in the medical establishment, concerns with the accelerated timeline for vaccine development, limited data on short and long-term side effects, and the political environment promoting racial injustice. Some participants were willing to consider the vaccine once the safety profile is robust and reassuring. Receiving a recommendation to take the vaccine from a trusted health care provider served as a facilitator. Health beliefs identified were similar to concerns around other vaccines, and included the fear of getting the infection with vaccination, and preferring to improve one's baseline physical health through alternative therapies., CONCLUSION: We found that hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine was high; however, provider recommendation and transparency around the safety profile might help reduce hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality., METHODS: Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe., RESULTS: LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present., CONCLUSION: Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.

{"text": "Pandemic Blood Donor Demographics - Do Changes Impact Blood Safety?. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 safety measures and possibly, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, may alter blood donor demography, which has the potential to alter blood safety. We characterized pre-pandemic and pandemic rates of donor infectious disease marker (IDM) reactivity which reflect the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) undetectable by current testing., METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations in a large national US blood collector identifies changes in self-reported behavioral risk factors and IDM reactivity. Data on allogeneic blood donor presentations and successful donations from March 1 through August 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019 were retrieved from the blood center's computer system. Donor demographics and deferrals for reported behavioral risk factors and confirmed-positive IDMs were compared in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods., RESULTS: With increasing mobile blood drive cancellations, pandemic donors were more likely than 2019 donors to be female, over age 30, non-Hispanic Whites, and have a post-secondary degree. First-time donations (at highest risk for confirmed-positive IDMs) did not substantially increase. Pandemic donors reported fewer behavioral risks and IDMs declined among these donors. Mid-pandemic introduction of screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not affect IDM rates., CONCLUSIONS: Unlike disasters, which tend to bring out more first-time donors with increased IDM reactivity and TTI residual risk, COVID-19 donors had lower IDM rates which were not affected by SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Already-low TTI residual risk is likely to have declined as a result. Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigeria police was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating local shutdowns, encouraging social distancing, enforcing stay-at-home mandates, and supervising compulsory wearing of face masks. Drawing from procedural justice theory, this study explored accounts of unlawful use of force, human rights violations, and other police misconducts that resulted from the enforcement of COVID-19 measures. Using a victim-centred approach involving qualitative, in-depth interviews with 71 people, who perceived their encounters with the police enforcing COVID-19 measures as bordering on their rights, were conducted, and a thematic analysis of the narratives carried out. Participants reported significant variety of police aggression directed towards them: including actual threats of physical violence, hostility, intimidation, extortion, and punishment. Female participants reported incidents of sexual harassment, unwanted sexual advances, and assault. The study concludes that the militarized option adopted by the police to enforce COVID-19 measures drew deeper divides between the police and communities than previously existed. This stresses the need for Nigeria police to train officers, reprimand erring officers, and deploy procedural justice principles in enforcing COVID-19 measures.

A rapid, accurate, and sensitive analytical method, ultrasonication-assisted spraying based fine droplet formation-liquid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (UA-SFDF-LPME-GC-MS), was proposed for the determination of trace amounts of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in human serum, urine, and saliva samples. To determine the best extraction strategy, several liquid and solid phase extraction methods were investigated for their efficiencies in isolation and preconcentration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from biological matrices. The UA-SFDF-LPME method was determined to be the best extraction method as it was operationally simple and provided accurate results. Variables such as the extraction solvent, spraying number, sodium hydroxide concentration and volume, sample volume, mixing method, and mixing period were optimized for the proposed method using the one-variable-at-a-time approach. In addition, Tukey's method based on a post hoc comparison test was employed to evaluate the significant difference between the parameters inspected. After the optimization studies, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were determined to be 0.7 and 2.4 mug/kg, respectively. The sensitivity of the GC-MS system based on the LOD was enhanced approximately 440-fold when the UA-SFDF-LPME method was employed. Spiking experiments were also conducted for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples to determine the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Recoveries for the human serum, urine, and saliva samples were found to be in the ranges 94%-102%, 95%-105%, and 93%-102%, respectively. These results were satisfactory and indicated that the hydroxychloroquine sulfate level in the above biological samples could be analyzed using the proposed method.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and associated mortality of well-defined neurologic diagnoses among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we prospectively followed hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients and recorded new neurologic disorders and hospital outcomes. METHOD(S): We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study of consecutive hospitalized adults in the New York City metropolitan area with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of new neurologic disorders (as diagnosed by a neurologist) was recorded and in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were compared between patients with COVID-19 with and without neurologic disorders. RESULT(S): Of 4,491 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized during the study timeframe, 606 (13.5%) developed a new neurologic disorder in a median of 2 days from COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), seizure (1.6%), stroke (1.9%), and hypoxic/ischemic injury (1.4%). No patient had meningitis/encephalitis or myelopathy/myelitis referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18/18 CSF specimens were reverse transcriptase PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with neurologic disorders were more often older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for age, sex, SOFA scores, intubation, history, medical complications, medications, and comfort care status, patients with COVID-19 with neurologic disorders had increased risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.62, p < 0.001) and decreased likelihood of discharge home (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.85, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Neurologic disorders were detected in 13.5% of patients with COVID-19 and were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality and decreased likelihood of discharge home.

Unpublished national databases suggest children follow a 'normal' peri-operative course; however, adult studies, such as COVIDSurg, demonstrate postoperative pulmonary complications of 51.2% and associated mortality of 23.8% [1]. We present the outcomes of five children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent procedures ranging from emergency cardiac to minor day-case surgery. Description Two of five children presented with non-specific symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, three were asymptomatic. The cases are summarised in Table 1. Patients 1 and 2 were complex ASA 3 infants with congenital heart disease and were ventilated in critical care postoperatively. Patient 1 presented with profound hypoxia due to undiagnosed transposition of the great arteries. He underwent an emergency balloon atrial septostomy and an arterial switch operation (open cardiac surgery) following a period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patient 2, with complex medical needs, had non-specific respiratory symptoms. She underwent three general anaesthetics for minor procedures. Neither patient suffered peri-operative respiratory complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and both patients followed the expected postoperative course proportionate with their underlying pathology. ASA 1-2 patients 3, 4 and 5, also followed the expected postoperative course without respiratory complication. Patient 4 was pyrexial with abdominal symptoms and underwent open appendicectomy. Patient 3 had two general anaesthetics to manage a urological malignancy and Patient 5 had an ear laceration repaired under local anaesthesia. Both were asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Discussion This case series adds to the limited existing data on the peri-operative impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Our work supports the hypothesis that children and young people with SARS-CoV-2 follow the 'expected' peri-operative course [1, 2]. Despite their heterogeneity, small size and complexity, no infants or children at our institution experienced adverse outcomes secondary to SARS-CoV-2.

Younger age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p<0.001), lack of access to an IBD nurse (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.19, p=0.04) and lack of education on reducing infection risk (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.50, p=0.017) were associated with significant stress, anxiety and/or depression., CONCLUSION: High prevalence of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and stress was identified among respondents. Improved access to IBD nurse support and greater attention to education are modifiable factors that may reduce depression, anxiety and/or stress among patients with IBD during the pandemic.

PURPOSE: To examine the joint associations of civil unrest and COVID-19 with probable anxiety and depression during the first half of 2020 in Hong Kong. Associations were compared between persons with low or high assets., METHODS: A population-representative sample of 4011 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 15 years or older were recruited between February and May 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety and depressive symptoms, unrest stress, COVID-19 stress, assets (savings and home ownership), and demographics., RESULTS: Stress due to unrest and COVID-19 was associated with higher prevalence of probable anxiety and depression; persons with both stressors had higher prevalence. This pattern was consistent among persons with low or high assets, but the probabilities of mental disorder were substantially higher among persons with fewer assets., CONCLUSIONS: The effect of stressors on probable anxiety and depression are cumulative: persons with stress due to civil unrest and to COVID-19 reported more mental disorders than persons with stress due to only one, or none of these factors. Overall high assets appear to buffer the consequences of stressors, lowering the risk of mental disorder.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Graduating Class Students at the University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Introduction: A poorly known contagious disease outbreak, like COVID-19, leads to unavoidable stress, fear, and anxiety. During the pandemic, University students suffer from adverse mental health outcomes resulted from the continuous spread of the disease, sensational media reporting, and implementation of social lockdown. Graduating class students are more affected due to cancellation and postponing of anticipated events such as exchange studies and graduation ceremonies. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among graduating class students., Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 10 to 30, 2020 at the University of Gondar. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 350 students. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire, entered in EPI DATA version 3, analyzed using SPSS version 21, and presented in frequencies, percentages, tables, and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable analysis was investigated using a binary logistic regression model., Results: The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among graduating class students was 22.2%, 39.6%, and 40.2% respectively. Living in an urban area, living with a family, sedentary lifestyle, unable to practice COVID-19 preventive measures, and having a contact history increases the risk of developing stress. Living in an urban area, substance use, sedentary lifestyle, and fear of infecting family increase the risk of developing anxiety. Students who came from an urban area, live with a family, study non-health departments, had confirmed cases in the family and did not perform physical exercise had higher odds of developing depression., Conclusion: More than one-fifth, more than one-third, and nearly two-fifths of graduating students had stress, anxiety, and depression respectively. It is better to develop effective strategies and interventions, train students about self-protection, and establish a psychological crisis intervention team to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Impact of cardiovascular disease and risk factors on fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 according to age: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective Previous studies that evaluated cardiovascular risk factors considered age as a potential confounder. We aimed to investigate the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors on fatal outcomes according to age in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed on data collected from PubMed and Embase databases up to 11 June 2020. All observational studies (case series or cohort studies) that assessed in-hospital patients were included, except those involving the paediatric population. Prevalence rates of comorbid diseases and clinical outcomes were stratified by mean patient age in each study (ranges: <50 years, 50-60 years and >=60 years). The primary outcome measure was a composite fatal outcome of severe COVID-19 or death. Results We included 51 studies with a total of 48 317 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Overall, the relative risk of developing severe COVID-19 or death was significantly higher in patients with risk factors for CVD (hypertension: OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.90; diabetes: 2.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.69) and CVD (3.11, 95% 2.55 to 3.79). Younger patients had a lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared with older patients; however, the relative risk of fatal outcomes was higher among the former. Conclusions The results of the meta-analysis suggest that CVD and its risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) were closely related to fatal outcomes in COVID-19 for patients across all ages. Although young patients had lower prevalence rates of cardiovascular comorbidities than elderly patients, relative risk of fatal outcome in young patients with hypertension, diabetes and CVD was higher than in elderly patients.

{"text": "Comparison of Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swab Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Detection of SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective(s): To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Result(s): The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs..Copyright \u00a9 2021 American Medical Association.

{"text": "A Super-Potent Tetramerized ACE2 Protein Displays Enhanced Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Infection. Approaches are needed for therapy of the severe acute respiratory syndrome from SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin g1 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The potential effectiveness of the WHO International Health Regulations capacity requirements on control of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of 114 countries. OBJECTIVES: We examined if the WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) capacities were associated with better COVID-19 pandemic control., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Population-based study of 114 countries., PARTICIPANTS: General population., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index., RESULTS: Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence (beta coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality (beta coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association., CONCLUSIONS: The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Pre-COVID-19 food insecurity prevalence and risk factors in caregivers of pediatric cancer patients at a children's cancer hospital. Background: Food insecurity (FI) affects 1 in 5 US households with children and is associated with malnutrition and poor diet quality in children. Malnutrition negatively impacts clinical trial outcomes, chemotherapy tolerance, and survival rate in cancer patients, who may be at higher FI risk given the financial toxicity of treatment. Thus, we aimed to assess FI prevalence and sociodemographics of pediatric patient caregivers at MD Anderson Cancer Center Children's Cancer Hospital (MDACC-CCH) and to identify healthcare provider sociodemographics and FI practice considerations. Method(s): We surveyed caregivers and providers at MDACC-CCH anonymously from December 2019 to January 2020. Caregiver surveys included sociodemographics and The Hunger Vital Sign FI screening tool. Oncologists and other providers were surveyed on FI-related practiceconsiderations. Univariate relationships between known covariates and FI were explored using purposeful covariate selection and multivariable logistic regression to model variables associated with FI risk factors. Result(s):Baseline characteristics are listed in Table. Of 67 caregiver responses, 36% were positive for FI. Univariate analyses revealed that race, education level, spousal/child support, marital status, and household income were associated with FI status. Final logistic regression model indicated that race other than Non-Hispanic White and lower education level were positively associated with FI. Of 38 provider responses, 58% reported being knowledgeable about FI to some extent. No providers referred patients to community food access resources. Conclusion(s): In a small pilot study, FI is prevalent in families of pediatric cancer patients at MDACC-CCH and may be associated with race and education level. Further research is needed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI in this population and to determine appropriate interventions and clinical pathways to improve FI status.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Classification of COVID-19 by Compressed Chest CT Image through Deep Learning on a Large Patients Cohort. Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has spread globally quickly, and has resulted in a large number of causalities and medical resources insufficiency in many countries. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is adopted as biopsy tool for confirmation of virus infection. However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost. We also applied our model on 48 asymptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that: (1) the positive rate of RT-PCR assay is 63.5% (687/1082). (2) 45.8% (22/48) of the RT-PCR assay is negative for asymptomatic patients, yet the accuracy of CT scans is 95.8%.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with schizophrenia may be at an increased risk for COVID-19 morbidity due to the disease characteristics. In this study, we aimed to explore the odds of significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among schizophrenia patients while controlling for potential sociodemographic and medical confounders., METHODS: Schizophrenia patients and age-and-sex matched controls (total n = 51 078) were assessed for frequency of COVID-19 positivity, hospitalizations, and mortality. The odds for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality were calculated using logistic regression models, while controlling for age, sex, marital status, sector, socioeconomic status, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease., RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia were less likely to test positive for COVID-19; however, they were twice as likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR 2.15 95% CI 1.63-2.82, P < .0001), even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors (OR 1.88 95% CI 1.39-2.55, P < .0001). Furthermore, they were 3 times more likely to experience COVID-19 mortality (OR 3.27 95% CI 1.39-7.68, P < .0001), compared to controls., CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of associations between schizophrenia and increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality compared to controls regardless of sociodemographic and medical factors.

{"text": "Exposure to Spoken Communication in Children With Cochlear Implants During the COVID-19 Lockdown. Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns in Ontario, Canada in the spring of 2020 created unprecedented changes in the lives of all children, including children with hearing loss., Objective: To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses., Design, Setting, and Participants: This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, >=80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method., Results: A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31)., Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study indicate a clear association of COVID-19 lockdowns with a reduction in children's access to spoken communication.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Perceptions of immunity and vaccination certificates among the general population: A nested study within a serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (SEROCoV-POP). At a time when COVID-19 immunity certificates are debated and vaccination certificates might potentially be made available if an effective vaccine is established, we conducted a study to elucidate public opinion on this issue. Our objective was to determine social and individual perceptions of COVID-19 immunity certificates through a population-based study. A nested survey within the SEROCoV-POP study, a population-based serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland, was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was proposed to 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants. Measures included percentage of participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements on immunity and vaccination certificates. Stratification by age, gender, education and work status was used to examine socio-demographic variations. Of the 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants, 1425 completed the questionnaire (response rate 93%; mean age +/- standard deviation 52 +/- 15.1 years; 51.9% women). About 80% of participants agreed that knowing one's serology status would lead to a change in one's behaviour. In the event that the presence of antibodies correlated with immunity, 60% of participants reported that certificates should be offered to the general population. The results showed variations in perceptions of certificates depending on the context (73% agreed on certificates' utility for travel, 72% for entering a country, and 32% for the right to work). Provided an effective vaccine was available, 55% of participants agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and 49% agreed that a vaccination certificate should be mandatory. About 68% reported a potential risk of discrimination and 28% a risk of deliberate infection. Differences were seen with age, gender and education level. This study shows that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland can envisage scenarios where COVID-19 immunity, and eventually vaccination, certificates would be useful. Seroprevalence estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain low to date, and the interpretability of serological testing and immunity remains undefined. However, the information from this study is important, especially the differences based on context and the socio-demographic variations, and should be taken into account if COVID-19-related certificates are to be implemented.Copyright \u00a9 2020 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd..

Introduction: We present the results of the COVID-19 rule-out protocol at Ghent University Hospital, a step-wise testing approach which included repeat NFS SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR, respiratory multiplex RT-PCR, low-dose chest CT and bronchoscopy with BAL to confirm or rule-out SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients admitted with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Results: Between 19 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, 455 non-critically ill patients with symptoms suspect for COVID-19 were admitted. The initial NFS for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR yielded 66.9%, the second NFS 25.4% and bronchoscopy with BAL 5.9% of total COVID-19 diagnoses. In the BAL fluid, other respiratory pathogens were detected in 65% (13/20) of the COVID-19 negative patients and only in 1/7 COVID-19 positive patients. Retrospective antibody testing at the time around BAL sampling showed a positive IgA or IgG in 42.9 % of the COVID-19 positive and 10.5% of the COVID-19 negative group. Follow-up serology showed 100% COVID-19 positivity in the COVID-19 positive group and 100% IgG negativity in the COVID-19 negative group. Conclusion: In our experience, bronchoscopy with BAL can have an added value to rule-in or rule-out COVID-19 in patients with clinical and radiographical high-likelihood of COVID-19 and repeated negative NFS testing. Furthermore, culture and respiratory multiplex PCR on BAL fluid can aid to identify alternative microbial etiological agents in this group. Retrospective analysis of antibody development in this selected group of patients suggests that the implementation of serological assays in the routine testing protocol will decrease the need for invasive procedures like bronchoscopy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Race, cytokines and depression. Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that racial discrimination and the perceived stress of racism have been associated with elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may serve as a biological risk factor for disparities in COVID- 19 cases and deaths in the US. Given the well-documented relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and major depression, the goal of the present study was to examine whether there were racial differences in the relationship between inflammation and major depression using a secondary analysis of an ethnically diverse dataset. Method(s): 121 subjects were recruited as part of a larger program of research investigating major depressive disorder (MDD) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). 46 were African American (21 healthy comparison subjects, 25 with MDD) and 75 were Caucasian (34 healthy comparison subjects, 41 with MDD). The final inclusion criterion for depressed subjects was a score of >=15 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Severity of depression was also assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression scale. In addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined in plasma/serum aliquots by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available Quantakine kits (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for human IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Between-group differences in CRP and serum cytokine levels were investigated using an ANCOVA adjusting for age, education, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index and diastolic blood pressure. Bivariate Pearson's correlation analyses using two-tailed tests were performed to examine associations between serum cytokines and depression severity. Result(s): In the non-depressed sample, African American participants had significantly higher levels of CRP and IL-6 than Caucasian participants (CRP: F =4.48, p = .04, df = 1, 46 ;IL-6: F=.9.33, p = .004, df = 1, 52). In the context of major depression, there was no difference between groups (CRP: F=.001, p = .973, df = 1,58); IL-6: F=.097, p = .757, df = 1, 64). Furthermore, IL-6 was not correlated with depression severity in African American participants (r = .14, p = .369) but was in Caucasian participants (r = .38, p = .001). Conclusion(s): The well-known relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and major depression may be moderatedby race due to high baseline levels of cytokines in African Americans. Based on the known literature, these elevations may be related to the stressful life events due to discriminatory experiences.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-secreting and memory B-cell generation in patients with acute COVID-19. Objectives: To predict the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), information regarding the immunological memory for disease-specific antigens is necessary. The possibility of reinfection, as well as the efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 that are currently under development, will largely depend on the quality and longevity of immunological memory in patients. To elucidate the process of humoral immunity development, we analysed the generation of plasmablasts and virus receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B (Bmem) cells in patients during the acute phase of COVID-19., Methods: The frequencies of RBD-binding plasmablasts and RBD-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the peripheral blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 were measured using flow cytometry and the ELISpot assay., Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 was characterised by the transient appearance of total as well as RBD-binding plasmablasts. ELISpot analysis indicated that most patients exhibited a spontaneous secretion of RBD-specific ASCs in the circulation with good correlation between the IgG and IgM subsets. IL-21/CD40L stimulation of purified B cells induced the activation and proliferation of Bmem cells, which led to the generation of plasmablast phenotypic cells as well as RBD-specific ASCs. No correlation was observed between the frequency of Bmem cell-derived and spontaneous ASCs, suggesting that the two types of ASCs were weakly associated with each other., Conclusion: Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells are generated during the acute phase of COVID-19. These findings can serve as a basis for further studies on the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell memory. Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is up-regulated in patients with heart failure. We sought to examine the potential association between reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Results: Of the 1162 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention between February 2014 and October 2018, we enrolled 889 patients with available clinical follow-up data. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews 1 month after the start of the French lockdown which began on 17 March 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to LVEF <40% (reduced LVEF) (n = 91) or >=40% (moderately reduced + preserved LVEF) (n = 798). The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death was significantly higher in the reduced LVEF group as compared with the moderately reduced + preserved LVEF group (9% vs. 1%, P < 0.001). No association was found between discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers and COVID-19 test positivity. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, reduced LVEF was an independent predictor of COVID-19 hospitalization or death (odds ratio: 6.91, 95% confidence interval: 2.60 to 18.35, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In a large cohort of patients with previous ACS, reduced LVEF was associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Aggressive COVID-19 testing and therapeutic strategies may be considered for patient with impaired heart function.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Mean platelet volume/platelet count ratio predicts severe pneumonia of COVID-19. Background: Although platelet mean volume/platelet count ratio (MPR) is considered to be a crucial marker of inflammatory and infectious diseases, the relationship between MPR and novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 85 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into low and high MPR group. Data from repeated measures were compared by the generalized estimating equations. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of MPR on the incidence of severe pneumonia (SP), with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) used to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome is the incidence of SP of COVID-19. Result(s): During follow-up, 17 (20.0%) patients were developed to SP. Compared with mild patients, patients with SP developed showed a higher MPR level at baseline, day 1, day 2, and day 3 after admission (P =.005, P =.015, P =.009, and P =.032, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method showed a higher incidence of SP in the high MPR group than the low MPR group (log-rank test = 10.66, P =.001). After adjustment, high MPR was associated with an elevated incidence of SP (HR, 5.841, 95% CI, 1.566-21.791, P =.009). The IPTW method also suggested that MPR was a significant factor related to the incidence of SP (HR, 8.337, 95% CI, 4.045-17.182, P <.001). Conclusion(s): High MPR level is an independent risk factor for severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "A potent bispecific nanobody protects hACE2 mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via intranasal administration. The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures. Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities. However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 , a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 exhibited sub-ng/ml neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo . In addition, we showed that intranasal administration of Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 provided 100% protection for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory administration. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 , with a novel heterotrimeric bispecific configuration, exhibited potent and broad neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and provided in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 transgenic mice via intranasal delivery. <h4>Graphical abstract:</h4> <h4>Highlights</h4> We described a novel heterotrimeric configuration of Nb-Nb H -Nb (Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 ) that exhibited improved viral inhibition and stability. Nb 15 -Nb H -Nb 15 provides ultrahigh neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and 18 mutant variants, including the current circulating variants of D614G and N501Y predominantly in the UK and South Africa.

Background: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are unclear, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa. We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions in South Africa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV-status and underlying comorbidities on in-hospital COVID-19 mortality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July. Among the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In addition, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of multiple comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: These data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention programmes, as well as early referral and treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: DATCOV is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the South African National Government.

{"text": "Comparative Effectiveness of Famotidine in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients. INTRODUCTION: Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately., METHODS: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model., RESULTS: We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use., DISCUSSION: We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.

{"text": "The promise of direct-to-consumer COVID-19 testing: ethical and regulatory issues. Widespread diagnostic and serological (antibody) testing is one key to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. While at first, the majority of COVID-19 diagnostic testing in the USA took place in healthcare settings, quickly a direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing market also emerged. In these DTC provision models, the test is initiated by a consumer and the sample collection occurs at home or in a commercial laboratory. Although the provision of DTC tests has potential benefits-such as expanding access to testing and reducing the risk of exposure for consumers and medical personnel-it also raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns. This article reviews these challenges and shows how they parallel and also diverge from prior concerns raised in the DTC health testing arena. The first part of this paper provides an overview of the landscape of diagnostic and serological tests for COVID-19, anticipating how provision models are likely to evolve in the future. The second part discusses five primary issues for DTC COVID-19 tests: test accuracy; potential misinterpretation of results; misleading claims and other misinformation; privacy concerns; and fair allocation of scarce resources. We conclude with recommendations for regulators and companies that aim to ensure ethically marketed DTC COVID-19 tests. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are the major viral RNA sensors that are essential for activation of antiviral immune responses. However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host defense. A deficiency in MDA5 ( MDA5 \u2212/\u2212 ), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely abolished in MDA5 \u2212/\u2212 and MAVS \u2212/\u2212 , but not in RIG-I \u2212/\u2212 cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5 fold higher in RIG-I \u2212/\u2212 than WT cells.

{"text": "The cytokine storm and thyroid hormone changes in COVID-19. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is now a worldwide pandemic. Among the many extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, recent evidence suggested a possible occurrence of thyroid dysfunction., PURPOSE: The Aim of the present review is to summarize available studies regarding thyroid function alterations in patients with COVID-19 and to overview the possible physio-pathological explanations., CONCLUSIONS: The repercussions of the thyroid of COVID-19 seem to be related, in part, with the occurrence of a \"cytokine storm\" that would, in turn, induce a \"non-thyroidal illness\". Some specific cytokines and chemokines appear to have a direct role on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. On the other hand, some authors have observed an increased incidence of a destructive thyroiditis, either subacute or painless, in patients with COVID-19. The hypothesis of a direct infection of the thyroid by SARS-Cov-2 stems from the observation that its receptor, ACE2, is strongly expressed in thyroid tissue. Lastly, it is highly probable that some pharmaceutical agents largely used for the treatment of COVID-19 can act as confounding factors in the laboratory evaluation of thyroid function parameters.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to control primary infection and correlates with severity of disease. The role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity, its relationship to antibodies, and pre-existing immunity against endemic coronaviruses (huCoV), which has been hypothesized to be protective, were investigated in 82 healthy donors (HDs), 204 recovered (RCs), and 92 active COVID-19 patients (ACs). ACs had high amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike IgG but lymphopenia and overall reduced antiviral T cell responses due to the inflammatory milieu, expression of inhibitory molecules (PD-1, Tim-3) as well as effector caspase-3, -7, and -8 activity in T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity conferred by polyfunctional, mainly interferon-gamma-secreting CD4+ T cells remained stable throughout convalescence, whereas humoral responses declined.

Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disproportionally affects frail, elderly patients and those with multiple chronic comorbidities. Whether patients on RRT have an additional risk because of their specific exposure and complex immune dysregulation is controversial. Methods To describe the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, region-wide registry study in adult patients on RRT versus the general population from March 2 to May 25, 2020. This study comprised all patients undergoing RRT in the Flanders region of Belgium, a country that has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results At the end of the epidemic wave, crude and age-standardized cumulative incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5.3% versus 2.5%, respectively, among 4297 patients on hemodialysis, and 1.4% versus 1.6%, respectively, among 3293 patients with kidney transplants (compared with 0.6% in the general population). Crude and age-standardized cumulative mortality rates were 29.6% versus 19.9%, respectively, among patients on hemodialysis, and 14.0% versus 23.0%, respectively, among patients with transplants (compared with 15.3% in the general population). We found no excess mortality in the hemodialysis population when compared with mean mortality rates during the same 12-week period in 2015-2019 because COVID-19 mortality was balanced by lower than expected mortality among uninfected patients. Only 0.18% of the kidney transplant population died of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions Mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is high in patients on RRT.

Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Such information is valuable for understanding virus transport and environmental transmission and even for designing anticontamination surfaces.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Are the obese patients and patients with severe malnutrition at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 during hospital admission?. BACKGROUND: Recently, authorities highlighted the need for nutritional management of individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of body mass index (BMI) and nutrition risk index (NRI) on hospital admission for detecting patients at risk for malnutrition and obesity and their association with patients' outcomes (disease type, length of hospital and home stay, and inflammatory markers). METHOD(S): The study of 100 patients with confirmed diagnosis Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). Assessment of patients took place at City General Hospital 8th September, Skopje, transformed into main COVID-19 Center during pandemic. Primary outcomes were NRI and BMI scores, while secondary ones: length of home and hospital stay, number of symptoms, presence of co-morbidities, type of disease, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULT(S): Patients were classified according to BMI and NRI scores. Increased BMI and NRI were associated with a severe type of disease. Most of the patients with severe disease were: obese (83.3%) and patients with risk for malnutrition (53.3%). Obese patients had a longer length of home stay and higher CRP levels, but the level of albumin was lower in a group with a risk for malnutrition. CONCLUSION(S): Future studies are needed to identify and quantify specific screening tool for nutrition deficiency in patients with COVID-19 infection.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Zorica Markovska, Dragan Mijakoski, Katerina Kuzmanova, Iskra Meshkova, Ivana Tusheva, Sasho Stoleski.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

There are 46 accredited medical schools and the majority are owned by the various State Governments. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The Federal Government of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Education closed all tertiary institutions in Nigeria including the medical schools on the 19th of March 2020 so as to curtail the effects of the pandemic. The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on tertiary institutions in Nigeria include the disruption of the academic calendar of the schools. This is capable of affecting the mental health of medical students. The smooth financing of medical education in Nigeria could be at risk. The career progression of medical students and those in the Residency Training Program and the doctors seeking greener pastures abroad are all affected. Unfortunately the state of infrastructure in the medical schools could be said to be poor. However, a good medical education scheme is said to guarantee the medical security of the populace. The Government and its agencies should work out plans of ameliorating the effects of the pandemic on medical education. This could also be a period to re-position the sector so as to be able to face similar challenges in future. The time has come for the full application of technology in delivering medical education in Nigeria. Incidentally, the pandemic has encouraged the application of e-learning techniques for the continuing professional development of medical doctors in the country. This should be the new way to go.

{"text": "High-level expression of the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD 320-537 in stably transfected CHO cells by the EEF1A1-based plasmid vector. The spike (S) protein is one of the three proteins forming the coronaviruses' viral envelope. The S protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a spatial structure similar to the S proteins of other mammalian coronaviruses, except for a unique receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a significant inducer of host immune response. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD is widely used as a highly specific minimal antigen for serological tests. Correct exposure of antigenic determinants has a significant impact on the accuracy of such tests-the antigen has to be correctly folded, contain no potentially antigenic non-vertebrate glycans, and, preferably, should have a glycosylation pattern similar to the native S protein. Based on the previously developed p1.1 vector, containing the regulatory sequences of the Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EEF1A1) from Chinese hamster, we created two expression constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tags. RBDv1 contained a native viral signal peptide, RBDv2 -human tPA signal peptide. We transfected a CHO DG44 cell line, selected stably transfected cells, and performed a few rounds of methotrexate-driven amplification of the genetic cassette in the genome. For the RBDv2 variant, a high-yield clonal producer cell line was obtained. We developed a simple purification scheme that consistently yielded up to 30 mg of RBD protein per liter of the simple shake flask cell culture. Purified proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing and non-reducing conditions and gel filtration; for RBDv2 protein, the monomeric form content exceeded 90% for several series. Deglycosylation with PNGase F and mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of N-glycosylation. The antigen produced by the described technique is suitable for serological tests and subunit vaccine studies.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Sinegubova et al.

{"text": "More Than Just Gene Therapy Vectors: Lentiviral Vector Pseudotypes for Serological Investigation. Serological assays detecting neutralising antibodies are important for determining the immune responses following infection or vaccination and are also often considered a correlate of protection. The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis. Finally, we evaluate their role as surrogates for the real virus and possible alternatives.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study. Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disease and its effect on multiple systems is growing. Kidney injury has been a topic of focus, and rhabdomyolysis is suspected to be one of the contributing mechanisms. However, information on rhabdomyolysis in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. We aim to describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed rhabdomyolysis. Materials and methods A retrospective observational cohort consisted of patients who were admitted and had an outcome between March 16 to May 27, 2020, inclusive of those dates at a single center in the Bronx, New York City. All consecutive inpatients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Patients with peak total creatine kinase (CK) over 1,000 U/L were reviewed; 140 patients were included in the study. The main outcomes during hospitalization were new-onset renal replacement therapy and in-hospital mortality. Results The median age was 68 years (range: 21-93); 64% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (73%), diabetes mellitus (47%), and chronic kidney disease (24%). Median CK on admission was 1,323 U/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 775 - 2,848). Median CK on discharge among survivors was 852 (IQR: 170 - 1,788). Median creatinine on admission was 1.78 mg/dL (IQR: 1.23 - 3.06). During hospitalization, 49 patients (35%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 24 patients (17.1%) were treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 66 (47.1%) died. Conclusions Rhabdomyolysis was a common finding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our hospital in the Bronx. The incidence of new-onset renal replacement therapy and in-hospital mortality is higher in patients who develop rhabdomyolysis. McMahon score, rather than isolated creatine kinase levels, was a statistically significant predictor of new-onset RRT. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 patients throughout their admission and use validated scores like McMahon score to devise their treatment plan accordingly.

{"text": "[Evaluation of measures to reduce the number of emergency physician missions in Tyrol during the COVID-19 pandemic]. BACKGROUND: During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, the entire emergency rescue system was confronted with major challenges. Starting on 15 March, all tourists were asked to leave the State of Tyrol, Austria. The main goal of the efforts was to ensure the usual quality of emergency medical care while reducing the physical contact during emergency interventions on site., METHODS: The Austrian Emergency Medical Service is physician-based, meaning that in addition to an ambulance team, an emergency physician (EP) is dispatched to every potential life-threatening emergency call. In Tyrol and starting on 17 March 2020, 413 types of emergency call dispatches, which were addressed with an ambulance crew as well as an EP crew before COVID-19, were now dispatched only with an ambulance crew. This procedure of dispatching differently as well as the general development of emergency calls during this period were analyzed from 15 March to 15 May 2020 and compared to the data from the same time period from 2017 to 2019., RESULTS: Despite the reduction of the population of around 30% because of absent tourists and foreign students staying in Tyrol, emergency calls with the operational keyword \"difficulty in breathing/shortness of breath\" rose by 18.7% (1533 vs. 1291), while calls due to traffic incidents decreased by 26.4% (2937 vs. 2161). Emergency calls with the dispatch of teams with an EP were reduced by 38.5% (1511 vs. 2456.3), whereby the NACA scores III and IV were the ones with the significant reduction of 40% each. For the reduced dispatchs, the additional dispatch of an EP team by the ambulance team amounted to 14.5%; however, for the keywords \"unconscious/fainting\" and \"convulsions/seizures\" the additional dispatch was significantly higher with over 40% each., DISCUSSION: There was an overall reduction of emergency calls. Considering, that the reduced dispatches would have led to an EP team dispatch the overall emergency doctor dispatches would have been higher than in the years before. Our study was not able to find the reasons for this increase. Only considering the additional dispatching of EPs, was this reduction in dispatching EP teams highly accurate, except for the symptoms of \"unconscious/fainting\" and \"convulsions/seizures\"; however, the actual diagnoses that the hospitals or GPs made could not be collected for this study. Therefore, it cannot be said for sure that there was equality in the quality of emergency medical care., CONCLUSION: It was possible to achieve the primary goal of reducing the physical contact with patients; however, before keeping these reductions of the dispatching order regarding. EPs for the routine operation, adaptions in these reductions as well as deeper evaluations under consideration of the data from hospitals and GPs would be necessary. Also, different options to reduce physical contact should be evaluated, e.g. building an EMT-led scout team to evaluate the patient's status while the EP team is waiting outside.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Developing insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of critical importance to overcome the global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2. Finding(s): In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19 x 10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04 x 10-12). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32 x 10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. Interpretation(s): Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease.

{"text": "Exosomes from COVID-19 patients carry tenascin-C and fibrinogen-\u03b2 in triggering inflammatory signals in distant organ cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-\u03b2 (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patient\u2019s plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-\u03baB pathway, we examined the status of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Importance</h4> Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected care of breast cancer patients world-wide. There is paucity of available data on cancer management in lower-middle income countries during this pandemic, we sought to determine the institutional approach towards management of breast cancer patients and the outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at our institution., Materials and methods: Clinicopathological and treatment record of cancer patients who presented to the Breast Clinic from 15th March to 31st December 2020 was retrieved from the institutional database for this retrospective clinical observational study., Results: A total of 292 patients were qualified for the analysis in which 206 patients (70.5%) underwent breast cancer surgeries. Only 10 of them (4.9%) were identified to be COVID-19 virus positive on routine pre-operative RT-PCR test before elective surgeries. All were asymptomatic, received home-based care via telecommunication and were operated at a later date when test turned out negative. None of them developed any complications post-operatively. Another group of 86 patients (29.5%) were referred for Neoadjuvant/Systemic chemotherapy in which COVID-19 infection was detected in only 4 patients (4.6%) while receiving cycles. Two patients shown symptoms of cough and fever hence hospitalised but were not candidates for Intensive Care Unit admission while other two patient were asymptomatic and isolated at home. All patients recovered well and chemotherapy was commenced again after negative RT-PCR test. No mortality was observed., Conclusion: Despite of being a global crisis particularly for cancer patients we observed infectivity, complications and fatality much lower among breast cancer cases.

{"text": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: first report from the Eastern Mediterranean. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the typical clinical and laboratory features and treatment of children diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and to understand the differences as compared to severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 in an eastern Mediterranean country., METHODS: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 and were admitted to hospital between March 26 and November 3, 2020 were enrolled in the study., RESULTS: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, were included in the study. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only three deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral., CONCLUSION: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19. Conjunctival injection and higher CRP and low WBC count are reliable diagnostic parameters for MIS-C cases. Key Points * MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19. * Higher CRP and low total WBC count are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C. * MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia in Patients with COVID-19. <h4>Background: </h4> Acute respiratory and renal failure as well as systemic coagulopathy are critical aspects of the morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs when IgG antibodies form against platelet factor 4-Heparin complex, resulting in platelet activation and removal, leading to a prothrombotic state. Studies have shown that only 6% who are investigated serologically for HIT actually have the diagnosis. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on all COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized between March and June 2020. Patients with suspicion for HIT were tested for HIT antibodies with IgG-specific platelet factor 4(PF4)-dependent enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Confirmatory testing with serotonin release assay (SRA) and heparin-induced platelet aggregation were used in cases with intermediate or low optical density (OD) with EIA positivity (EIA+). Due to rarity of disease, a through literature review on HIT in COVID-19 patients was also analyzed. Results Incidence of EIA\u2009+\u2009in COVID-19 patients was 0.6%, significantly higher than in the general population 0.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The incidence of thromboembolic events in EIA\u2009+\u2009patients was 87.5%, significantly higher than the rate of 10.90% in all COVID-19 patients (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

Serological confirmation of HIT diagnosis was 37.5% which is significantly higher than confirmation of HIT in nonCOVID-19 patients 6% (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Of 39 HIT antibody positive patients in the literature, 23.07% had positive confirmatory testing (6 SRA, 3 HIPAA) which is significantly higher than 5.6% in the general population (p\u2009=\u20090.00001). The incidence of thrombosis in EIA\u2009+\u2009COVID-19 patients in the literature was 56.4% which is significantly higher than reported rates of thrombotic events in in all COVID-19 patients in the literature at 4.8% 1 (p\u2009=\u20090.00001). Conclusion Our study indicates incidence of HIT is higher in the COVID-19 population. This can be attributed to the cytokine storm and severe sepsis seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

{"text": "Retrospective Post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of Autopsies with COVID-19-Suggestive Pathology Supports the Absence of Lethal Community Spread in Basel, Switzerland, before February 2020. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world. While the first case was recorded in Hubei in December 2019, the extent of early community spread in Central Europe before this period is unknown. A high proportion of asymptomatic cases and undocumented infections, high transmissibility, and phylogenetic genomic diversity have engendered the controversial possibility of early international community spread of SARS-CoV-2 before its emergence in China. Method(s): To assess the early presence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland, we retrospectively performed an analysis of deaths at University Hospital Basel between October 2019 and February 2020 (n = 310), comparing the incidence of clinical causes of death with March 2020 (n = 72), the month during which the first lethal COVID-19 cases in Basel were reported. Trends of COVID-19-suggestive sequelae, such as bronchopneumonia with organization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolisms (PE) were evaluated. In cases where autopsy was performed (n = 71), analogous analyses were conducted on the cause of death and pulmonary histological findings. Eight cases with a COVID-19-suggestive clinical history and histopathology between October 2019 and February 2020, and 3 cases before October 2019, were selected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Result(s): A statistically significant rise in pulmonary causes of death was observed in March 2020 (p = 0.03), consistent with the reported emergence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland. A rise in lethal bronchopneumonia was observed between December 2019 and January 2020, which was likely seasonal. The incidence of lethal ARDS and PE was uniformly low between October 2019 and February 2020. All autopsy cases analyzed by means of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR yielded negative results.

Background: Common variable immunodeficiency is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults. Affected patients fail to mount an appropriate humoral response against community acquired infectious diseases and recent reports have provided data supporting the increased susceptibility of these patients to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this context, the infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma could represent an effective therapeutic strategy. Case presentation: 25-year old woman diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency in 2013, developed severe COVID-19 that rapidly progressed to pneumonia presenting with multiple bilateral lung opacities that were both central and peripheral and presented as ground-glass and consolidation types involving all lobes, bilaterally. As blood oxygen saturation decayed and lung abnormalities were not responsive to large spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, patient was placed on mechanical ventilation and compassionate-use of approved COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma was introduced. The patient presented a rapid response to the approach and mechanical ventilation could be interrupted 24 h after first dose of COVID-19 convalescent donor plasma. As a whole, the patient received four doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma during a period of 6 days. There was rapid improvement of clinical status, with interruption of supplemental oxygen therapy after 6 days and reduction of lung abnormalities as evidence by sequential computed tomography scans.

Background The association of pulmonary embolism (PE) with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE is unknown. Purpose To conduct meta-analysis of the study-level incidence of PE and DVT and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE from multicenter individual patient data. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I2 = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I2 = 0.94), respectively. PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography. DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE. D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 mug/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT.

Objective(s): To systematically review the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents compared with adults. Data Sources: PubMed and medRxiv were searched from database inception to July 28, 2020, and a total of 13926 studies were identified, with additional studies identified through hand searching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection: Studies that provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) compared with adults (20 years and older) derived from contact tracing or population screening were included. Single-household studies were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data were followed, which was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random-effects meta-Analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary infection rate (contact-Tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population screening studies) among children and adolescents compared with adults. Result(s): A total of 32 studies comprising 41640 children and adolescents and 268945 adults met inclusion criteria, including 18 contact-Tracing studies and 14 population screening studies. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37-0.85), with substantial heterogeneity (I2= 94.6%). Three school-based contact-Tracing studies found minimal transmission from child or teacher index cases. Findings from population screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-Analysis. Most studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-Analysis, there is preliminary evidence that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with an odds ratio of 0.56 for being an infected contact compared with adults. There is weak evidence that children and adolescents play a lesser role than adults in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. This study provides no information on the infectivity of children.Copyright \u00a9 2021 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Low Zinc Levels at Admission Associates with Poor Clinical Outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. BACKGROUND: Zinc is an essential micronutrient that impacts host-pathogen interplay at infection. Zinc balances immune responses, and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with an increased risk for severe severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression, and thus might represent a useful biomarker., METHODS: We ran an observational cohort study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel, we have studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations., FINDINGS: Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 microg/dL at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability, and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells., INTERPRETATION: Low SZC is a risk factor that determines COVID-19 outcome. We encourage performing randomized clinical trials to study zinc supplementation as potential prophylaxis and treatment with people at risk of zinc deficiency.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Antibodies, and Neutralizing Capacity in Milk Produced by Women with COVID-19. Whether mother-to-infant SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur during breastfeeding and, if so, whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk during maternal COVID-19 illness remain important questions. Using RT-qPCR, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample (n = 37) collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis. Although we detected evidence of viral RNA on 8 out of 70 breast skin swabs, only one was considered a conclusive positive result. In contrast, 76% of the milk samples collected from women with COVID-19 contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, and 80% had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG. In addition, 62% of the milk samples were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro, whereas milk samples collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were unable to do so. Taken together, our data do not support mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a beneficial source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness. IMPORTANCE Results from prior studies assaying human milk for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, have suggested milk may act as a potential vehicle for mother-to-child transmission. Most previous studies are limited because they followed only a few participants, were cross-sectional, and/or failed to report how milk was collected and/or analyzed. As such, considerable uncertainty remains regarding whether human milk is capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child. Here, we report that repeated milk samples collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis did not contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, we found that milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness as milk likely provides specific immunologic benefits to infants.

Background: The efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) is primarily ascribed as a source of neutralizing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. However, the composition of other immune components in CCP and their potential roles remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to describe the composition and concentrations of plasma cytokines and chemokines in eligible CCP donors., Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 20 prepandemic healthy blood donors without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 140 eligible CCP donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Electrochemiluminescence detection-based multiplexed sandwich immunoassays were used to quantify plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations (n = 35 analytes). A SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay was also performed. Differences in the percentage of detection and distribution of cytokine and chemokine concentrations were examined by categorical groups using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively., Results: Among CCP donors (n = 140), the median time since molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was 44 days (interquartile range = 38-50) and 9% (n = 12) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Compared with healthy blood donor controls, CCP donors had significantly higher plasma levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-15, IL-21, and macrophage-inflammatory protein-1, but lower levels of IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-16, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (P < .0014). The distributions of plasma levels of IL-8, IL-15, and IFN-inducible protein-10 were significantly higher among CCP donors with high (>=160) versus low (<40) anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers (P < .0014). The median levels of IL-6 were significantly higher among CCP donors who were hospitalized versus nonhospitalized (P < .0014)., Conclusions: Heterogeneity in cytokine and chemokine composition of CCP suggests there is a different inflammatory state among the CCP donors compared with SARS-CoV-2 naive, healthy blood donors.

Furthermore, the underutilization of mental health services among pregnant women has been widely documented., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that are associated with pregnant women's intentions to seek mental health services. We specifically assessed pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems in mainland China., METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from February to March, 2020 among 19,515 pregnant women who were recruited from maternal health care centers across various regions of China. A subsample of 6248 pregnant women with probable depression (ie, those with a score of >=10 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) or anxiety (ie, those with a score of >=5 on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale) was included in our analysis., RESULTS: More than half (3292/6248, 52.7%) of the participants reported that they did not need mental health services. Furthermore, 28.3% (1770/6248) of participants felt that they needed mental health services, but had no intentions of seeking help, and only 19% (1186/6248) felt that they needed mental health services and had intentions of seek help. The results from our multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, education level, and gestational age were factors of not seeking help. However, COVID-19-related lockdowns in participants' cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were protective factors of participants' intentions to seek help from mental health services., CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that promote seeking help for mental health problems among pregnant women should also promote social support from health care providers and trust between pregnant women and their care providers.

This finding made us think that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the coinfection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluated the coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR tests. We found coinfection with influenza virus in 22.3%, RSV, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, human metapneumovirus in 2.9%, and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of coinfection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of coinfection with Human metapneumovirus in children.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM improves clinical sensitivity early in disease course. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is diagnosed by molecular-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. Method(s): Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. Result(s): Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at > 30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86 and 0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM < 14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG >= 14 days. Conclusion(s): The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV < 14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Asymptomatic carriage rates and case fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff in Irish nursing homes. BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately affected nursing homes (NH). In Ireland, the first NH case COVID-19 occurred on 16 March 2020. A national point-prevalence testing programme of all NH residents and staff took place (18 April 2020 to 5 May 2020). AIMS: to examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations, proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom profile and resident case fatality. METHOD(S): in total, 45 NHs surveyed, requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases and outcomes for residents from 29 February 2020 to 22 May 2020. RESULT(S): surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2,043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1,741 residents, 1,972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1,741)-40.8% (710/1,741) laboratory confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic and 3.1% (54/1,741) clinically suspected. Resident case fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with 'early-stage' (<28 days) versus 'later-stage' outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in 'early' outbreak NHs had recovered compared with those with 'late' outbreaks (37.4 versus 61.7%; chi2=56.9, P<0.001). Of 395 NH staff across 12 sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho=0.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): this study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the NH sector. Systematic point-prevalence testing is necessary to reduce risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and manage outbreaks in this setting.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "Geographical reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Lombardy (Italy) during the early phase. The first identification of autochthonous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy was documented by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies of L. Sacco Hospital (Milano, Italy) on 20th February 2020 in a 38 years old male patient, who was found positive for pneumonia at the Codogno Hospital. Thereafter Lombardy has reported the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially in Milano, Brescia and Bergamo provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the potential presence of different viral clusters belonging to the six main provinces involved in Lombardy COVID-19 cases in order to highlight peculiar province-dependent viral characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 20 full length genomes obtained from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020, aligned with 41 Italian viral genome assemblies available on GISAID database as of 30th March, 2020: two main monophyletic clades, containing 8 and 53 isolates, respectively, were identified. Noteworthy, Bergamo isolates mapped inside the small clade harbouring M gene D3G mutation. The molecular clock analysis estimated a cluster divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains had spread worldwide at different times, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, this epidemiological reconstruction suggests that virus initial circulation in Lombardy was ascribable to multiple introduction. The phylogenetic reconstruction robustness, however, will be improved when more genomic sequences are available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The present study aimed to examine the influence of environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsThis ecological study analyzed the association between environmental and demographic factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection by province. Environmental temperature and humidity were obtained from the Spanish Meteorological Agency and province extension, and latitude and altitude above sea level of their capital cities from the Geographical Institute. The seroprevalence SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by province was obtained from a nationwide representative survey performed in June 2020, after the first pandemic wave in Spain. Linear regression was used in the analysis.ResultsThe seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of the 50 provinces ranged from 0.2% to 13.6%. Altitude explained nearly half of differences in seroprevalence (determination coefficient [R 2 ]=0.46, p<0.0001). Seroprevalence in people residing in provinces above the median altitude (215 meters) was threefold higher (6.5% vs 2.1%, p<0.0001). In the multivariate linear regression, the addition of population density significantly improved the predictive value of the altitude (R 2 =0.55, p<0.0001). Every 100 meters of altitude increase and 100 inhabitants/km 2 of increase in population density, the seroprevalence increased by 0.84 and 0.63 percentage points, respectively.ConclusionsEnvironmental conditions related to higher altitude in winter-spring, as lower temperature and absolute humidity, may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Critical evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic assays is needed to guide clinical decision-making and ensure that these assays provide optimal benefit to patients and the public. Here, three commercially available assays with widespread distribution capabilities are compared. A total of 667 specimens, 103 from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 564 collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed in parallel using the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 total antibody and Abbott Alinity SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays; a subset of 55 samples from patients with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infections was additionally evaluated using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay. Qualitative agreement between the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays was 98.7% (658/667), with Cohen's kappa value of 0.919 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.867 to 0.972). Qualitative agreements with the Abbott IgM assay were 92.7% (51/55, Abbott IgG) and 85.5% (47/55, Roche total antibody). Diagnostic specificities determined using pre-COVID-19 samples for the Abbott IgG and Roche total antibody assays were 99.65% (95% CI, 98.72 to 99.90%) and 100.00% (95% CI, 99.32 to 100.00%), respectively, spanning claims made by each manufacturer.

Background: In response to COVID-19 pandemic, many trials were established to assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in the treatment of infected patients. A CCP collection program was initiated at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital blood bank in June 2020 as part of a multi-center clinical trial aiming to assess the safety and efficiency of CCP in hospitalized patients. Male and female donors with no history of prior pregnancy were recruited through social media and by direct contact of patients who recovered from COVID- 19 and had been discharged from the hospital, a minimum of two weeks from clinical recovery. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and IgG antibodies was performed. Donations were made by plasmapheresis and units underwent pathogen reduction before freezing. Aim(s): We aim to retrospectively review CCP donations made in our hospital blood bank from June 2020 to August 2020, including donor characteristics and antibody kinetics. Method(s): A review was performed on all donors' characteristics including general demographics and antibody status. In addition, we reviewed the processing details of CCP donations. Plasmapheresis was performed after screening the donors for SARSCoV- 2 IgG by Euroimmunassay and assessing donor eligibility including serological testing for transfusion transmitted infections. Donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Donors with negative RT-PCR results were accepted, while those with positive RT-PCR were scheduled for donation 28 days after clinical recovery. Antibody levels were repeated on the plasma unit on the day of donation. Additional samples were stored for future testing of neutralizing antibodies to correlate with IgG results obtained. An approximate volume of 600 ml plasma was collected by apheresis at each procedure. Donors were invited to donate again in a week's time (maximum of 4 donations) if tolerated the procedure well and had normal protein levels. Result(s): Over the two months period, a total of 92 recovered COVID-19 patients was screened (81.5% males, 91.3% Omanis). Median antibody titer at presentation was 4.5 (interquartile range; IQR 5.8). Total of 49 donors (53.3%) were eligible to donate CCP (51% O+, 16.3% A+). Median age was 31 (IQR 12). Cases of donor deferral were low IgG levels (20.7%), positive serology (6.5%), underlying medical condition (4.3%), and low hemoglobin (3.3%). The total number of donations made was 56 with a mean apheresis time of 45 minutes (minimum:17 min, maximum: 1:35 hours). The frequency of plasmapheresis was once (64.9%), twice (24.3%), and trice (10.8%). The trend of antibody level upon repeat testing on the plasma unit was: upward (43.2%), downward but above threshold for accepting the unit (45.9%), and variable (10.8%). Seven donors had post-donation reactions including presyncope (n = 5), vomiting (n = 1) and pain at the phlebotomy site (n = 1). No serious adverse reactions were reported. The total CCP volume collected was 31,848 ml and an average unit volume of 227 ml. Mean processing time including pathogen reduction by Mirasol treatment and labeling was 40 min (minimum: 24 min, maximum: 1:40 hours). Summary/Conclusions: Our results show that initiating a CCP collection program in our center is feasible and generally safe with no sequelae on the donors. The majority of the donors were of group O+, in keeping with blood group frequencies reported among Omanis. Additional studies are needed to understand the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, how CCP donor characteristics affect antibody level, and how antibody levels relate to CCP recipient outcome.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a serious public health crisis, and no specific treatments or vaccines are available yet. A nucleocapsid protein (NP)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection method is not only important in disease diagnosis, but is required for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy during the development of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we expressed both the NP and N-terminally truncated NP (DELTAN-NP) of SARS-CoV-2 in an Escherichia coli expression system and described the purification of the soluble recombinant NP and DELTAN-NP in details. The identities of the NP and DELTAN-NP were confirmed with mass spectrometry. We then used immunoglobulin G detection ELISAs to compare the sensitivity of NP and DELTAN-NP in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DELTAN-NP showed greater sensitivity than NP in the analysis of serially diluted sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with inactive SARS-CoV-2 and in human sera diluted 1:400. DELTAN-NP showed a positive detection rate similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in human sera.

Accurate serological assays to detect antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify potential candidates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) donation. This study compared the performances of commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) with respect to detection of IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The diagnostic accuracy of five commercially available EIAs (Abbott, Euroimmun, EDI, ImmunoDiagnostics, and Roche) for detection of IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using cross-sectional samples from potential CCP donors who had prior molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 214) and samples from prepandemic emergency department patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 1,099). Of the 214 potential CCP donors, all were sampled >14 days since symptom onset and only a minority (n = 16 [7.5%]) had been hospitalized due to COVID-19; 140 potential CCP donors were tested by all five EIAs and a microneutralization assay. Performed according to the protocols of the manufacturers to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of each EIA ranged from 76.4% to 93.9%, and the specificity of each EIA ranged from 87.0% to 99.6%. Using a nAb titer cutoff value of >=160 as the reference representing a positive test result (n = 140 CCP donors), the empirical area under the receiver operating curve for each EIA ranged from 0.66 (Roche) to 0.90 (Euroimmun). Commercial EIAs with high diagnostic accuracy to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not necessarily have high diagnostic accuracy to detect high nAb titers.

Our aim was to compare compliance and perinatal outcomes in women with GDM who participated in telemedicine versus in-person visits. Study Design: IRB-approved retrospective cohort study comparing those with GDM who received telemedicine diabetes care in March-June 2020 to those who received care in-person in March-June 2018. Primary perinatal outcomes were polyhydramnios, large for gestational age (LGA), shoulder dystocia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia, which were combined into a composite outcome for multivariable analysis. Result(s): 213 women met inclusion criteria: 109 in 2020 and 104 in 2018. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Women in 2020 had significantly greater HbA1C at diagnosis (5.4 vs 5.1%, p=0.0005), 3rd trimester average glucose (99.2 vs 96.9 mg/dL,p=0.02), 3rd trimester average fingersticks/day (3.7 vs 3.4,p<0.0001), and weight gain at delivery (p=0.02).

Background: Currently, there are no proven and defined methods for treating coronavirus infection and associated pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Plasma from recovered individuals is one of the available treatment options, with a sufficient number of people who can donate neutralizing high-titer immunoglobulin-containing plasma. Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are antibodies that protect cells from disease-causing organisms. They are updated by the body in the form of an immune response in a natural way, and their mechanism works by infections and vaccination against infections. According to the results of studies on the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in the treatment of MERS-CoV, it was found that for effective treatment of convalescent plasma, the titer of neutralizing antibodies must be higher than 1:80. There is an FDA requirement for convalescent plasma: the NAb titer must be at least 1:160. The main task was to find suitable donors with the necessary level of neutralizing antibodies. Aim(s): Determine the titer of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the immune plasma of anti-SARS-COV-2. Method(s): Samples of convalescent plasma from donors who went through COVID-19 were obtained from the Research and Production Center of Transfusiology in the city of Nur-Sultan. Titration of virus-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-COV-2 was performed at the National center of biotechnology, Nur-Sultan. For titration, a museum preparation of SARS-COV-2 virus 'B00001' with a titer of 2.4x105 PFU/ml, Vero E6 cells, EMEM medium (BioWhittaker BE12-668F), 2% low-melting water agarose (iNtRON Biotechnology 32035) was used. Class G immunoglobulins were determined using immunochemical analysis: CLIA, ELISA ('Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG', 'ELISA EDI for detecting IgG class antibodies to the new COVID-19 coronavirus'). Result(s): Convalescent plasma obtained from 10 convalescent donors aged 40+/-5.4 years was studied. The anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody cut-off index (COI) before donation is 8.18+/-0.40.

Objective While evidence on the interface between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is accumulating, clinical data on RAAS peptide alteration among coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients is missing. Design and Methods In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged >=18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs. 66.8pmol/l, -52.7% [95%CI -68.5% to -36.9%]; angiotensin II: 37.7 vs. 92.5pmol/l, -59.2% [95%CI -72.1% to -46.3%]; angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs. 6.6pmol/l, -49.7% [95%CI -59.2% to -40.2%]; angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs. 7.6pmol/l, -64.9% [95%CI -84.5% to -45.3%]). While the plasma renin activity (PRA-S) was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs. 207.9pmol/l, -58.5% [95%CI -71.4% to -45.6%]), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Early therapy with remdesivir and antibody combinations improves COVID-19 disease in mice. Improving the standard of clinical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of single agent therapies has not been comprehensively defined over the time course of infection and it is not known if combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies. In kinetic studies in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis model, we show that single-agent therapies exert potent antiviral effects even when initiated relatively late after infection, but their efficacy is diminished as a function of time. RDV and a cocktail of two mAbs in combination provided improved outcomes compared to single agents alone extending the therapeutic window of intervention with less weight loss, decreased virus lung titers, reduced acute lung injury, and improved pulmonary function. Overall, we demonstrate that direct-acting antivirals combined with potent mAb can improve outcomes over single agents alone in animal models of COVID-19 thus providing a rationale for the coupling of therapies with disparate modalities to extend the therapeutic window of treatment.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Risk of Secondary Infection Waves of COVID-19 in an Insular Region: The Case of the Balearic Islands, Spain. The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence, the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, these isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Exposed, Presymptomatic Infective, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Eguiluz, Fernandez-Gracia, Rodriguez, Pericas and Melian.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) widely available in public places. This may warrant determining whether cases of unintentional ocular exposure are increasing, especially in children. Objective(s): To describe the epidemiologic trend of pediatric eye exposures to ABHS and to report the severity of the ocular lesions. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Retrospective case series conducted from April 1, 2020, to August 24, 2020. Cases were retrieved from the national database of the French Poison Control Centers (PCC) and from a pediatric ophthalmology referral hospital in Paris, France. Cases of ocular exposure to chemical agents in children younger than 18 years during the study period were reviewed. Cases of ABHS exposure were included. Exposures: The following data were collected: age, sex, circumstances of exposure, symptoms, size of the epithelial defect at first examination, time between the incident and re-epithelialization, and medical and/or surgical management. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison of the number of eye exposures to ABHS in children between April to August 2020 and April to August 2019. Result(s): Between April 1 and August 24, 2020, there were 7 times more pediatric cases of ABHS eye exposures reported in the PCC database compared with the same period in 2019 (9.9% of pediatric eye exposures in 2020 vs 1.3% in 2019; difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 7.4-9.9; P <.001). The number of cases occurring in public places increased in 2020 (from 16.4% in May to 52.4% in August). Similarly, admissions to the eye hospital for ABHS exposure increased at the same period (16 children in 2020 including 10 boys; mean [SD] age, 3.5 [1.4] years vs 1 boy aged 16 months in 2019). Eight of them presented with a corneal and/or conjunctival ulcer, involving more than 50% of the corneal surface for 6 of them. Two cases required amniotic membrane transplant. Conclusions and Relevance: These data support the likelihood of an increasing number of unintentional ocular exposures to ABHS in the pediatric population. To maintain good public compliance with hand disinfection, these findings support that health authorities should ensure the safe use of these devices and warn the parents and caregivers about their potential danger for children.Copyright \u00a9 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

{"text": "Documentation of plateau pressures and the incidence of high plateau pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Introduction: Elevated Plateau Pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS have previously been shown to increase the time needed for liberation from mechaincal ventilation, increase the lenght of ICU stay and increase hospital mortality (1,2). International guidelines for the management of ARDS, including ARDS secondary to COVID-19, reflect these findings and recommend maintaining plateau pressures of less than 30 cmH2O (3). Objective(s): 1. To assess how frequently Plateau Pressures were recorded in mechanically ventilated patients admitted with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. 2. To investigate the incidence of elevated plateau pressures in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19. Method(s): This was a retrospective audit of all patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 admitted to the ICU over a three month period (06/03/2020-06/06/2020) who required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Data was collected from patient's medical notes, including both paper charts as well as digital documentation. Data was also collected from patient's flow charts. Data was only collected on days during which the patient was mechanically ventilated on a Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC), Pressure Control (PC) or Volume control (VC) mode of ventilation. Elevated plateau pressures were defined as a pressure greater than or equal to 30 cmH2O. Result(s): 24 patients were admitted to the ICU with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 during this time period. They spent a cumulative total of 428 days intubated and ventilated in ICU during this time. The total number of days spent on a PRVC, PC or VC mode of ventilation was 262. This was broken down as 250 days on PRVC, 8 days on PC and 4 days on VC. In total, plateau pressures were recorded on 47% of days while on a PRVC, PC or VC mode of ventilation (124 of the 262 days). There was a documented contraindication to recording plateau pressures on 2 out of the 262 days. Of the recorded plateau pressures, 29.8% were greater than or equal to 30 cmH20 (37 of the 124 measurements). Conclusion(s): We found that for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19, plateau pressures were not being measured routinely and were frequently found to be above the threshold limit recommended by international guidelines. This could have implications for patient's length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation as well as hospital mortality.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 persistence is associated with antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses. Background: Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, most individuals develop neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immunity. However, some individuals reportedly remain SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive by pharyngeal swabs weeks after recovery. Whether viral RNA in these persistent carriers is contagious and stimulates SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses is unknown. Method(s): This cohort study was conducted between April 3rd-July 9th 2020, recruiting COVID-19 recovered individuals that were symptom-free for at least 14 days. We collected serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific total Ig, IgA and IgM detection by ELISA, pharyngeal swabs (two time points) for ddPCR and PBMCs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell dextramer analyses. Finding(s): We enrolled 203 post-symptomatic participants with a previous RT-PCR-verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. At time point 1, a median of 23 days (range 15-44) after recovery, 26 individuals (128%) were PCR positive. At time point 2, 90 days (median, range 85-105) after recovery, 5 (53%) were positive. There was no difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels between the PCR negative and positive group. The persistent PCR positive group however, had SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T-cell responses of significantly increased breadth and magnitude. Assisted contact tracing among persistent PCR positive individuals revealed zero new COVID-19 diagnoses among 757 close contacts. Interpretation(s): Persistent pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in post-symptomatic individuals is associated with elevated cellular immune responses and thus, the viral RNA may represent replicating virus. However, transmission to close contacts was not observed indicating that persistent PCR positive individuals are not contagious at the post-symptomatic stage of the infection.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Immunity certification for COVID-19: Ethical considerations. Restrictive measures imposed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have resulted in severe social, economic and health effects. Some countries have considered the use of immunity certification as a strategy to relax these measures for people who have recovered from the infection by issuing these individuals a document, commonly called an immunity passport. This document certifies them as having protective immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has advised against the implementation of immunity certification at present because of uncertainty about whether long-term immunity truly exists for those who have recovered from COVID-19 and concerns over the reliability of the proposed serological test method for determining immunity. Immunity certification can only be considered if scientific thresholds for assuring immunity are met, whether based on antibodies or other criteria. However, even if immunity certification became well supported by science, it has many ethical issues in terms of different restrictions on individual liberties and its implementation process. We examine the main considerations for the ethical acceptability of immunity certification to exempt individuals from restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as needing to meet robust scientific criteria, the ethical acceptability of immunity certification depends on its uses and policy objectives and the measures in place to reduce potential harms, and prevent disproportionate burdens on non-certified individuals and violation of individual liberties and rights.Copyright \u00a9 2021, World Health Organization.

{"text": "669 Maternal outcomes based on asymptomatic versus symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the DC region. Objective: We sought to evaluate maternal outcomes based on asymptomatic versus symptomatic COVID-19 infection among pregnant women. Study Design: This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of pregnant women that delivered at six hospitals in a large not-for-profit health care organization from March through July 2020. Universal COVID-19 infection testing was performed at all participating hospitals upon admission to labor and delivery. We compared maternal outcomes based on COVID-19 disease severity characterized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal outcomes including postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection, endometritis and ICU admission. Data were analyzed using the chi2, Fisher exact test, Student t test, and logistic regression where appropriate. A value of P <.05 was considered significant. Result(s): Of 144 pregnant women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 82 (56.94%) were asymptomatic and 62 (43.06%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. There was no difference in demographic data between the two groups except that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were more common in the asymptomatic group (29.3% vs 12.9 %, P 0.02). Compared to asymptomatic women, symptomatic women had higher odds of the composite maternal outcome (9.8% vs 22.6%; aOR 2.6; 95% CI [1.01-6.9]). Compared to women with asymptomatic disease, women with symptomatic COVID-19 were more likely to require inpatient admission during their illness (1.2% vs 22.6%; aOR 23.4; 95% CI [3.0-183.7]). Women with asymptomatic disease did not require ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, develop pneumonia or receive any COVID-19 specific treatments. Conclusion(s): Women with symptomatic COVID-19 infection are more likely to have clinically significant disease compared to women with asymptomatic disease. Though asymptomatic COVID-19 infection have a more benign disease course, these women have a higher incidence of hypertensive disorders which may lead to other maternal morbidity.

{"text": "547 Neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 positive mothers. Objective: To evaluate neonatal morbidity in mothers with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women delivered at ProMedica Health care system was performed from March to August 2020. All scheduled term pregnant patients underwent universal nasopharyngeal COVID-19 qRT-PCR 48 hours prior to delivery. Positive patients were triaged over the phone for symptoms. Positive patients were identified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical disease according to SMFM guidelines. Newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) from neonate nasopharyngeal swabs at 24 and 48 h after delivery. Neonatal morbidity due to COVID-19 was identified as positive test at birth, low APGAR score, O2 therapy, fever or extended stay due to respiratory complications. Result(s): 2357 deliveries occurred out of which 1165 pregnant patients (44.4%) were universally tested. Ten out of 1165 (0.9%) mothers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during preadmission universal screening. Eight (0.7%) were asymptomatic at the time of delivery, two developed (0.2%) mild disease at the time of admission. There was no (0/7) positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 from newborns delivered from positive mothers. No significant difference in neonatal morbidity noticed when compared to newborns of negative SARS-CoV-2 mothers during the same timeframe (Table 1). Conclusion(s): There was no significant difference in neonatal outcomes of newborns delivered from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease. No cases of vertical transmission observed among neonates delivered from COVID-19 positive mothers. None of the newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 disease which delivered either at local hospital or tertiary care hospital were transferred to NICU.

Sexual minority persons experience health disparities associated with sexual stigma and discrimination and have a high prevalence of several health conditions that have been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). Current COVID-19 surveillance systems do not capture information about sexual orientation. To begin bridging the gap in knowledge about COVID-19 risk among sexual minority adults, CDC examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults in the prevalence of underlying conditions with strong or mixed evidence of associations with severe COVID-19-related illness (3), by using data from the 2017-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). * When age, sex, and survey year are adjusted, sexual minority persons have higher prevalences than do heterosexual persons of self-reported cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease (including myocardial infarction, angina, or coronary heart disease), obesity, smoking, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and stroke. Sexual minority adults who are members of racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic also have higher prevalences of several of these health conditions than do racial/ethnic minority adults who are heterosexual.

{"text": "144 Changes in healthcare utilization for obstetric patients at during the COVID pandemic. Objective: Healthcare utilization strategies drastically changed in March of 2020 with onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes occurred at government, systems, and individual levels with anecdotal reports of decreased hospital admissions and emergency department visits for non-COVID-19. Such observations could be attributable to fear of exposures in a healthcare setting or a decreased incidence of disease due to a paradoxical benefit of quarantine measures. We sought to evaluate changes in inpatient obstetrical care utilization during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to a time-matched period 1 year prior. Study Design: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from a single tertiary care center during the COVID-19 pandemic who presented to the obstetric triage, antepartum (AP), or labor and delivery (LD) units from April-June 2020. We compared these admissions to the same time period from the previous year. Average daily visits, daily admissions, and length of stay on LD and AP units was compared between time periods. Result(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significantly fewer average daily visits to the obstetric triage unit (23.5 visits/day vs. 21.0 visits/day, p=.01). Daily triage visits reached a nadir during the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in St. Louis and increased thereafter despite a second wave of illness (Fig. I). There was no difference in daily average LD admissions, AP admissions, or maternal transfers between time periods. The average length of stay was slightly lower for all admissions (3.3 days vs. 3.1 days, p=.02). Conclusion(s): Patients were less likely to seek care in the obstetric triage unit early in the COVID-19 pandemic while antepartum/labor admissions and maternal transports were unchanged. Study findings suggest that inpatient obstetric care requirements remained unchanged, despite societal social distancing measures, which underscores the need for adequate resources, safety, and personnel for essential obstetric care, which cannot be forestalled in a pandemic.

From 95 symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR from 1 May to 14 July 2020 in Dallah Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, CT angiography was done for 25 patients suspected to have pulmonary embolism and have no contraindication for contrast study. 11 cases of them showed CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Retrospectively, CT angiography was analyzed and detailed findings were recorded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital, and the patient consent was waived., Results: The mean age of the included patients was 49 +/- 11 years; the youngest was 22 years, and the oldest was 64 years. Common symptoms in the 25 cases that underwent CT angiography were fever that was noted in 21/25 cases (84%), shortness of breath in 18/25 cases (72%), cough in 16/25 cases (64%), and severe myalgia/body fatigue in 13/25 cases (52%). The less common symptoms were sore throat in 11/25 cases (44%) and headache in 10/25 cases (40%). Regarding CT findings, 4/25 cases (16%) had unilateral lung disease and 21/25 cases (84%) had bilateral disease, with slight predilection for the right lower lobe (10/25 cases, 40%). Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was seen in 13/25 cases (52%), and GGO with consolidation was seen in 12/25 cases (48%). Common accompanying CT signs included crazy paving stone sign in 15/25 cases (60%) and air bronchogram in 12/25 cases (48%). From the 25 patients that showed respiratory deterioration and elevated serum D-dimer level, 11 cases confirmed to have acute pulmonary embolism, while 14 cases showed negative result for pulmonary embolism. 6/11 were male and 5/11 were female. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed at a mean of 21 days from symptom onset. Unilateral acute pulmonary embolism was seen in 3/11 cases, while 8/11 cases showed bilateral distribution. Among 11 cases with acute pulmonary embolism, no emboli at the central level could be seen, but 3 cases showed pulmonary embolism at the lobar level, 3 cases at the segmental level, and 5 cases at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental levels., Conclusion: In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we should maintain a high suspicion for its thromboembolic complications such as acute pulmonary embolism that was mainly diagnosed at the end of 3rd week from symptom onset. We suggest that whenever a CT evaluation of the parenchymal involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia is performed, a simultaneous evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is also essential in order to identify early signs of associated pulmonary embolism.

An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic.

Magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested cardiac involvement post-Covid-19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes. This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

There is limited literature on prevalence of pre-existing CeVD in COVID-19 patients, and outcomes are unknown. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD. Method(s): English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25-2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09-1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14-1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively. In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patient with pre-existing CeVD had 2.67-fold (1.75-4.06) higher odds of poor outcomes. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease have poor outcomes and extra precautions should be taken in managing such patients during the ongoing pandemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Predicting Mortality in Critically Ill COVID-19\u00a0Patients in A Low-Resources Setting. <h4>Background: </h4> Since its molecular isolation on January 7, 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly, taking governments worldwide off-guard. The virus arrived in low and middle-income countries violently, especially in Latin America. Ecuador received the worst outbreak in the world if we count excess mortality per capita. Although one study has reported the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 in Ecuador, there is no clinical course or outcome data among intensive care patients with COVID-19 in Ecuador. This study describes the clinical, epidemiological, and therapeutical features of 89 patients hospitalized in a secondary-level hospital in Quito, Ecuador. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study. We collected health records data from adult patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Quito, Ecuador, during the first five months of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Ecuador. All patients had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA infection diagnostic, a positive real-time RT-PCR, and pulmonary imaging suggesting COVID-19. We used the Chi-square test or a Fisher's exact statistic to analyze risk and associations between survivors and non-survivors due to COVID-19. We used the ROC curve analysis to predict mortality, determining cut-off points for the parameters related to mechanical, analytical, and cytometry ventilation. At the multivariate level, we used the Wald test to evaluate model categorical predictors during the regression analysis. Results 89 patients with COVID-19 were recruited during the study. The average age of the patients was 54.72 years. Man represented 68.54% (n\u2009=\u200961) and women 31,46% (n\u2009=\u200928). Significant differences were observed in terms of mortality (men 40.98% vs. women 17.76%). Serological parameters demonstrated that LDH and IL-6 at 24 hours were higher among non-survivors when compared with survivors. Persistent hypercapnia (\u2009>\u2009>\u200945 mmHg), a PaFiO2 ratio of less than 140 mmHg, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration greater than nine mmHg were also associated with higher mortality. Conclusions Increased levels of LDH at 24 hours, IL-6, the lymphocyte and platelet count at 48 hours, the neutrophil count at 48 hours, and the INL are factors associated with higher motility, increased risk of failed extubation and reintubation", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

An after action review from a UK tertiary critical care centre. Purpose: The aim of this study is to describe the incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) amongst patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with COVID-19. In addition we aim to detail the range of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) modalities offered to these patients (including peritoneal dialysis - PD - and intermittent haemodialysis - IHD) in order to meet demand during pandemic conditions. Material(s) and Method(s): Single-centre retrospective case note review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICU. Result(s): Amongst 136 patients without a prior history of End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD), 108 (79%) developed AKI and 63% of admitted patients received RRT. Due to resource limitations the range of RRT options were expanded from solely Continuous Veno-Venous HaemoDiaFiltration (CVVHDF - our usual standard of care) to include PD (in 35 patients) and IHD (in 15 patients). During the study period the proportion of RRT provided within ICU as CVVHDF fell from 100% to a nadir of 39%. There were no significant complications of either PD or IHD. Conclusion(s): During periods of resource limitations PD and IHD can safely be used to reduce dependence on CVVHDF in select patients with AKI secondary to COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2021", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus gene 5 modulates pathogenesis in mice. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia that emerged in 2012. There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing nonsynonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo in both humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL) or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-DELTA5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-DELTA5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-DELTA5, in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nucleotide (nt) deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Expression of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-DELTA5-infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that the rMERS-MA-DELTA5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (35%). Animal models together with reverse-genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse-genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.Copyright \u00a9 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

Background: The impact of asthma on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. Objective(s): To investigate the asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 and compare outcomes between patients with and without asthma. Method(s): In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for studies reporting asthma prevalence in general patients with COVID-19 or comparing outcomes between patients with and without asthma, and excluded duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, comments, single case reports, or small case series (<10 cases). We determined the pooled estimates of effect using random-effect model. Result(s): On the basis of 131 studies (410,382 patients), we found great variability in the prevalence of comorbid asthma among patients with COVID-19 in different countries or regions ranging from 1.1% to 16.9%. No significant difference in asthma prevalence was found between hospitalized and nonhospitalized (risk ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92-1.43), severe and nonsevere (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.57), intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92-1.54), dead and survived (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.11), intubated/mechanically ventilated and nonintubated/mechanically ventilated (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17) patients with COVID-19. Patients with asthma have a lower risk of death compared with patients without asthma (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.98).

{"text": "The Dynamic Expression of Potential Mediators of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Cellular Entry in Fetal, Neonatal, and Adult Rhesus Monkeys. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, induced by the pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly all over the world. There is considerable variability among neonates, children, and adults in the incidence of infection and severe disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we analyzed the transcriptome data of primate animal model of Rhesus monkeys to evaluate the expression levels of possible SARS-CoV-2 receptors and proteases and immunologic features in the lungs, colons, livers, and brains at different developmental stages. Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in neonates compared with other populations, which imply the high incidence of infection. Other potential receptors and Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) and cathepsin of endosomal proteases also exhibited dynamic and differential expression patterns. The expression of receptors (ACE2, BSG, and DPP4) and proteases (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS9, CTSL, and CTSB) were highly correlated during lung development, suggesting the high susceptibility of the lungs. TMPRSS9 was specifically highly expressed in the lungs and reached the highest level in neonates, similar to TMPRSS2. Moreover, the immune cell infiltration analysis revealed immunity immaturity in neonates, implying the association with the mild or moderate type of COVID-19. The results might help researchers design protective and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 in populations at different ages.

Generating and characterizing immunoreagents to enable studies of novel emerging viruses is an area where ensembles of synthetic genes, recombinant antibody pipelines, and modular antibody-reporter fusion proteins can respond rapidly. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread through the global population causing widespread morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic chaos. Using SARS-CoV-2 as our model and starting with a gBlocks encoded nucleocapsid (N) gene, we purified recombinant protein from E. coli, to serve as bait for selecting semisynthetic nanobodies from our Nomad single-pot library. Clones were isolated in days and first fused to Gaussia luciferase to determine EC50 in the tens of nM range, and second fused to the ascorbate peroxidase derivative APEX2 for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. To generate inherently fluorescent immunoreagents, we introduce novel periplasmic sdAb fusions made with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I, which were produced at milligram amounts. The fluorescent fusion proteins enabled concise visualization of SARS-CoV-2 N in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus 24 h post infection, akin to the distribution of SARS-CoV N, thereby validating these useful imaging tools. SdAb reactivity appeared specific to SARS-CoV-2 with very much weaker binding to SARS-CoV, and no noticeable cross-reactivity to a panel of overexpressed human codon optimized N proteins from other CoV. High periplasmic expression levels and in silico immortalization of the nanobody constructs guarantees a cost-effective and reliable source of SARS-CoV-2 immunoreagents.

{"text": "Rotational thromboelastometry and thromoboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with hypercoagulable states and high incidences of thromboembolic complications. Conventional coagulation tests show trends of coagulopathy, but currently no test reliably identifies COVID-19 patients at increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Rotational thromboelastrometry (ROTEM) is a point-of-care device that evaluates viscoelastic changes during coagulation and may provide valuable information to identify patients at risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to evaluate ROTEM profiles of COVID-19 patients in identifying thromboembolic complications. Method(s): All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in April 2020 were enrolled in this single-center, retrospective observational study. Blood samples were collected for ROTEM thromboelastometry. Coagulation patterns were analyzed using extrinsic, intrinsic and fibrinogen rotational thromboelastometry activators (respectively EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM). ROTEM patterns were analyzed for all COVID-19 patients and were compared between patients with and without thromboembolic complications. Hypercoagulability was defined as a reduction in clot formation time (CFT) and a maximum clot firmness (MCF) above the upper limit of the normal reference values. Patients who were clinically suspected to have a thromboembolic complication underwent additional imaging. The decision for imaging was based on clinical features and was at the discretion of the attending intensivist. Additionally, ROTEM parameters were compared with conventional coagulation parameters including, partial thromboplastin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and platelet count. Result(s): ROTEM patterns of forty-seven COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Ten patients (21.3%) developed thromboembolic complications during ICU admission, all being pulmonary embolisms confirmed by CT-scan. MCF in EXTEM was lower in patients with and without thromboembolic complications (75.0 vs. 77.9 mm, p = 0.047). COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic complications had an increased CFT compared to patients without complications in EXTEM (54.1 vs. 42.9 s, p = 0.001) and INTEM (53.3 vs. 43.5 s, p = 0.03). EXTEM clot firmness at 5 minutes (A5) was significantly decreased in patients with thromboembolic complications compared to patients without complications (58.5 vs. 64.3 mm, p = 0.009). The conventional coagulation tests showed no significant differences between patients with and without thromboembolic complications. Univariate linear analysis identified nine variables for multiple regression analysis. None of the ROTEM variables were associated with thromboembolic complications in the multiple linear regression model. ROTEM variables could not predict the risk of developing thromboembolic complications (R2 = 0.266; F (9,37) = 1,489; p 0.188). Conclusion(s): ROTEM patterns of COVID-19 patients showed no clinical significant differences between patients with and without thromboembolic complications.

Result(s): A 39 year old male presented with a 7 day history of pharyngitis, pyrexia and vomiting. His medical history was significant for seizures associated with a traumatic brain injury. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV 2 infection 12 weeks previously. SARS-CoV 2 was not detected on multiple investigations during this presentation. The patient developed type 1 respiratory failure. Chest X Ray and CT Thorax revealed a bilateral cavitating pneumonia and pleural effusions. Blood cultures were positive for Fusobacterium necrophorum. He was also severely thrombocytopenic. Increasing oxygen requirements necessitated mechanical ventilation. A subsequent CT neck revealed a left sided 3.5cm peritonsillar abscess with an associated internal jugular vein thrombosis. The patient was transferred to another Intensive Care Unit with on site ENT support. Spontaneous rupture of the peritonsillar abscess precipitated septic shock requiring debridement and washouts in the Intensive Care Unit and in Theatre.

{"text": "COVID-19 safety: aerosol-generating procedures and cardiothoracic surgery and anaesthesia - Australian and New Zealand consensus statement. Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers are at risk of infection from aerosolisation of respiratory secretions, droplet and contact spread. There are a number of procedures that represent a high risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery. It is important that adequate training, equipment and procedures are in place to reduce that risk. Recommendations: We provide a number of key recommendations, which reduce the risk of aerosol generation during cardiothoracic surgery and help protect patients and staff. These include general measures such as patient risk stratification, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, consideration to delay surgery in positive patients, and careful attention to theatre planning and preparation. There are also recommended procedural interventions during airway management, transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiopulmonary bypass, chest drain management and specific cardiothoracic surgical procedures. Controversies exist regarding the management of low risk patients undergoing procedures at high risk of aerosol generation, and recommendations for these patients will change depending on the regional prevalence, risk of community transmission and the potential for asymptomatic patients attending for these procedures. Changes in management as a result of this statement: This statement reflects changes in management based on expert opinion, national guidelines and available evidence. Our knowledge with regard to COVID-19 continues to evolve and with this, guidance may change and develop. Our colleagues are urged to follow national guidelines and institutional recommendations regarding best practices to protect their patients and themselves.

{"text": "Pain Symptoms in Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Literature Review. Purpose: On 11 March, 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. It brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2-14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Pain symptoms present important challenge to clinicians' diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms should be systematically summarized., Results: The virus can invade different tissues of the body and cause different pain manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory system, and patients develop sore throat, fever, cough, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms. Moreover, it infects the nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea), and cardiovascular system (eg, chest pain, palmus, and cardiac injury). The incidence rate is 1.7-33.9% for headache, 0.7-47.1% for sore throat, 1.5-61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6-17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9-14.5% for abdominal pain. In comparison with chest and abdominal pain, COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop headache, sore throat, and myalgia/arthralgia., Conclusion: Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. Therefore, the summary of pain symptoms for COVID-19 patients can help doctors improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with atypical or mild symptoms and adopt more targeted treatment methods.

They were divided into two groups according to COVID-19 severity: non-critical (n = 56) and critical (n = 45). The PNI was calculated upon hospital admission: 10 x serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 x total lymphocyte count (/mm3). Critical COVID-19 was defined as having one of the following features: respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation; shock; organ dysfunction necessitating admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between the PNI with COVID-19 severity was analyzed. Results: The PNI was significantly lower in critically ill than that in non-critically ill patients (P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the PNI was a good discrimination factor for identifying COVID-19 severity (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the PNI to be an independent risk factor for critical illness due to COVID-19 (P = 0.002). Conclusions: The PNI is a valuable biomarker that could be used to discriminate COVID-19 severity.

{"text": "Biorepositories (biobanks) of human body fluids and materials as archives for tracing early infections of COVID-19. Identifying the individuals and geographical regions witnessing early infections or outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is helpful for studying the early epidemiology or even the origin of the novel coronavirus. Here, we put forward a strategy that can potentially contribute to this goal. Human body fluids and biological materials collected before the COVID-19 pandemic may serve as archives for retrospective testing of early human infections before the recent outbreaks. These have been routinely donated, collected, and archived, creating biorepositories or \"biobanks\" for clinical or research purposes. SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials and its antibodies have been confirmed in various types of biological samples from COVID-19 patients, including blood, sperm, umbilical cord blood, lung, heart, kidney and so on, making these biological archives as candidates for detecting early COVID-19 infections. Unlike sewage-based epidemiology which only provides information on the geographical aspect, viruses identified in archived human biological samples provide direct links to individuals, from whom a wealth of personal information including their profession, hobbies and activities, travel history, and previous exposure to wildlife can all be retrieved. By analyzing the patterns and links in the behavior of those early infected individuals, it is possible to trace the origin of the virus, for instance, in certain wild animals or local environments.

{"text": "Quick Olfactory Sniffin' Sticks Test (Q-Sticks) for the detection of smell disorders in COVID-19 patients. Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection represents a worldwide critical health burden from the sanitary perspective. This disease's symptoms range from a mild flu-like form to a severe life-threatening respiratory disease and respiratory failure. Several patients, however, remain paucisymptomatic. Among the symptoms that seem relevant are the changes in taste and smell, regardless of the disease's severity., Methods: Data from patients affected by COVID-19 infection, hospitalized from 15 to 29 April, 2020, were analyzed. Questionnaires about smell, taste, and nasal function were administered to all, and a proportion also received the Quick olfactory Sniffin' Sticks Test (q-Sticks) to objectivate the presence of anosmia or hyposmia. The results of instruments and Q-Sticks were then compared., Results: Thirty-seven patients (20 males, 54.1%), with a mean age 0f 69.19 years (SD = 17.96; median 76, IQR: 63-82) were evaluated. Among the patients, 8 (22%) were asymptomatic. Out of the remaining 29 patients, 28 (97%) had fever, 19 (66%) asthenia, 11 (38%) dry cough, 10 (34%) dyspnea, and 6 (21%) gastroenteric symptoms. The q-Sticks test was performed on 27 patients and showed that 6 with anosmia, and 16 patients had hyposmia, where only 5 (14%) patients complained of loss of smell by conducting the questionnaires., Conclusion: Although olfactory disturbances may be secondary to other factors, a sudden onset of anosmia or hyposmia should be assessed as a possible symptom of COVID-19 infection. The use of questionnaires or anamnestic collection is sometimes not enough, while adding to them a simple test such as the q-Sticks test can provide more accurate and reliable data. A simple, easy-to-perform, and reliable tool (q-Sticks) for olfactory disorders assessment can be administered to identify the real size of anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection and detect the early stage of infection or paucisymptomatic patients, therefore becoming important to reduce the spreading of the pandemic.

{"text": "Ventilatory support in COVID-19 patients: Shift in clinical practice. Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented as a challenge to Intensive Care Units (ICU). An effort is still being made to clarify the main features and the impact of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in outcomes. Objective(s): To describe the characteristics of an ICU COVID-19 population and to analyze the evolution of the decision on the ideal ventilation moment and the impact on mortality between invasively ventilated and non-invasively ventilated patients. Method(s): Retrospective cohort study of Polymerase Chain Reaction confirmed SARS-COV-2 adult patients admitted to an ICU in the interior north of Portugal between March 23 and May 23, 2020. Data collection on clinical characteristics and management decisions was performed. Patients were grouped according to the oxygen or ventilation support mode: group 1 - IMV; group 2 - non-invasive ventilation, high flow nasal canula and facial mask oxygen. Variables were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software and the significance level used was 0.05. Result(s): During the study period were admitted 20 patients, 60% were women, the median age was 67.5 years [44; 87]. Seventeen patients (85%) were admitted for respiratory failure, 35% of whom with PaO2/ FiO2 ratio below 100mmHg, 2 patients (10%) for septic shock in context of gastroenteritis and 1 patient with acute coronary syndrome and mild respiratory symptoms. The median SAPS II at admission was 34 [15; 50], the mortality rates in the ICU and at 30 days were 25% and 35%, respectively. When analyzing the ventilation support, 60% required IVM and 55% were proned. When comparing groups, group 1 mortality was clinically significative higher (p = 0.055) and had a significative longer ICU stay (p = 0.006). In terms of laboratorial features on admission there wereno differences between groups. Regarding COVID 19 and ICU complication, group 1 had more superinfections (p = 0.019), but without impact in mortality. Otherwise, we found no differences in renal, cardiac or thromboembolic complications. Within group 1, the median PaO2/ FiO2 ratio was initially higher, mainly in the first month. As time went by and experience accumulated, a tendency to tolerate lower ratios before invasive ventilation and an inverted ratio between the number of ventilated and non-ventilated patients can be seen. Conclusion(s): Patients who received IMV had a higher rate of infection and a significantly longer stay in ICU with impact on mortality. Initially patients were invasively ventilated earlier in accordance with studies and expert opinion, however with experience, non-invasive strategies were preferred without impact in the outcomes. The decision not to ventilate was well tolerated and allowed patients to overcome infection without the need to be ventilate, even under traditional \"mandatory\" ventilation ratios. Outcomes like neurological dysfunction were not evaluated but we raise the hypothesis that non-ventilation probably spares that dysfunction, as well as decreases secondary lung infection. The main limitation of this study is the small sample. Further largescale studies would be interesting analyzing the mortality and prevalence of post-ICU impairment in ventilated and non-ventilated patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Correcting hypophosphataemia in a paediatric patient with Sanjad-Sakati syndrome through a single oral dose of potassium phosphate intravenous solution. Sanjad-Sakati syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is quite common in Kuwait. Among a wide range of complications in Sanjad-Sakati syndrome patients is the vulnerability to infections and subsequent hypophosphataemia. Hypophosphataemia is a metabolic alteration that contributes to numerous consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, if hypophosphataemia is left unresolved, it may culminate in death. A 20-month-old boy of 2.5 kg body weight diagnosed with Sanjad-Sakati syndrome was initially admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit after recovering from COVID-19, and then shifted to the general ward. He was diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia and urinary tract infection. After 9 days, the patient showed severe hypophosphataemia with serum phosphate concentration reaching 0.33 mmol/L. Despite the availability of potassium phosphate intravenous solution, it was difficult to administer potassium phosphate intravenously because of the small body size and low body weight of the patient. Therefore, 0.6 mL potassium phosphate containing 2.4 mEq of potassium and 5.3 mEq of phosphate was administered through a nasogastric tube. The patient showed rapid response after a single dose through the nasogastric tube. Such an intervention in Sanjad-Sakati syndrome patients shows possible advantages of shifting drug administration from intravenous to oral route that includes a convenient route of administration, whether in the intensive care unit or in the general ward. Moreover, shifting drug administration from the intravenous to oral route overcomes the risk of cannula-induced infection and reduces nurses' workload.

Background: We analyzed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on neurologic emergencies, depending on the patients' triage score in a setting with relatively few COVID-19 cases and without lack of resources. Method(s): Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with a dedicated neurologic emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17, 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke, and the quality of stroke care. Result(s): A total of 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median [interquartile range] per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p = 0.015). The median numbers of patients per week with triage 1 (emergent) and 4 (non-urgent) were comparable (51 [43-58] vs. 59 [54-62]; p = 0.132, and 10 [4-16] vs. 16 [7-18]; p = 0.310, respectively).The median number of patients per week declined in categories 2 and 3 in 2020 (41 [37-45] vs. 57 [52-61]; p = 0.004, and 28 [23-35] vs. 61 [52-63]; p = 0.002, respectively.

{"text": "Retrospective analysis of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients presenting to emergency department. Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases incidentally diagnosed at the emergency department. Methodology: This study retrospectively analysed the medical data of patients who presented to the emergency department, between March 1 and May 1, 2020, without COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia on admission but were incidentally detected to have thoracic computerised tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19. The patients' sociodemographic and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory test results, clinical and radiological findings, treatment protocols and prognoses were recorded. Result(s): We incidentally diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia in 81 asymptomatic patients. All patients presented to the emergency department with traumatic injuries. Of these, 38 (46%) were injured in in-vehicle traffic accidents; 27 (34%) out-of-vehicle traffic accidents; 14 (18%) simple falls; and 2 (2%) falls from a height. Only 42 (48%) patients had a history of suspected contact with a COVID-19 positive individual. The mean time to symptom onset of 81 patients was 5 +/- 2 days. An analysis based on thoracic computerised tomography findings showed that the common finding found in all patients was ground glass opacity (GGO). While 55 (68%) patients had GGO alone, 10 (12%) had additional fine reticulations; 6 (7%) had an additional halo sign; 6 (7%) had an additional air bronchogram and 4 (5%) had an additional area of consolidation. None of the patients died during follow-up, and all of them were discharged. Conclusion(s): Early identification and isolation of asymptomatic patients are of great importance for reducing the speed of propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidentally diagnosed cases have made us consider that there is a need to increase the number of screening tests. We also believe that healthcare staff should suspect COVID-19 pneumonia in every patient irrespective of presentation type, place importance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and not examine any patient without wearing PPE.Copyright \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The Impact of Halting Elective Admissions in Anticipation of a Demand Surge Due to the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: In anticipation of a demand surge for hospital beds attributed to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) many US states have mandated that hospitals postpone elective admissions. OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate excess demand for hospital beds due to COVID-19, the net financial impact of eliminating elective admissions in order to meet demand, and to explore the scenario when demand remains below capacity. RESEARCH DESIGN: An economic simulation to estimate the net financial impact of halting elective admissions, combining epidemiological reports, the US Census, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the National Inpatient Sample. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored the results while varying assumptions for demand and capacity. SUBJECTS: Inputs regarding disease prevalence and inpatient utilization were representative of the US population. Our base case relied on a hospital admission rate reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 137.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (378.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (207.4 per 100,000). On average, elective admissions accounted for 20% of total hospital admissions, and the average rate of unoccupied beds across hospitals was 30%. MEASURES: Net financial impact of halting elective admissions. RESULT(S): On average, hospitals COVID-19 demand for hospital bed-days fell well short of hospital capacity, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net financial impact of a 90-day COVID surge on a hospital was only favorable under a narrow circumstance when capacity was filled by a high proportion of COVID-19 cases among hospitals with low rates of elective admissions. CONCLUSION(S): Hospitals that restricted elective care took on a substantial financial risk, potentially threatening viability. A sustainable public policy should therefore consider support to hospitals that responsibly served their communities through the crisis.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions., Results: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Curtailing the Spring 2020 COVID-19 surge required sweeping and stringent interventions by governments across the world. Wastewater-based COVID-19 epidemiology programs have been initiated in many countries to provide public health agencies with a complementary disease tracking metric and non-discriminating surveillance tool. However, their efficacy in prospectively capturing resurgences following a period of low prevalence is unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral signal was measured in primary clarified sludge harvested every two days at the City of Ottawa's water resource recovery facility during the summer of 2020, when clinical testing recorded daily percent positivity below 1%. In late July, increases of >400% in normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater were identified 48 h prior to reported >300% increases in positive cases that were retrospectively attributed to community-acquired infections.

Objectives: There is limited information on the performance of rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected asymptomatic individuals. In this field study, we evaluated the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for this purpose. Method(s): A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9-87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care.

{"text": "Evaluation of osseointegration and crestal bone loss associated with implants placed in diabetic and other medically compromised patients. Diabetes and other medically compromising diseases may affect people in many ways. Missing teeth can be replaced by various methods including dental implants. The stability, a more natural appearance, and minimizing the risk of bone resorption attribute to its direct anchor into bones. Nevertheless, diabetic patients may experience failure of implant placement due to microvascular complications that lead to sluggish healing after surgery. In addition, some medications are believed to impair bone healing, thus compromising dental implant success. This paper evaluates osse-ointegration and crestal bone loss of implants placed in medically compromised patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using patient records from Department of Prosthodontics, Saveetha Dental College, Chennai, from June 2019 to March 2020. Patients who had dental implants and were medically compromised were chosen randomly. Data were collected and then subjected to statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics analysis was done to find the correlation between crestal bone loss and medically compromised individuals. Microsoft Excel 2016 data spreadsheets were used to collect data, which were later exported to SPSS. Among 89 patients, more than 60% experienced crestal bone loss following implant placement. Diabetic patients recorded the highest prevalence of bone loss in comparison to other medically compromised patients. A significant association was found between crestal bone loss and diabetic patients (p < 0.05) Patients whose diseases were under control with medication were also observed to have bone loss. Overall, the prevalence of crestal bone loss seems to be higher in diabetic patients compared to other medically compromised patients. There seems to be definite correlation between diabetes and crestal bone loss.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans -complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans- complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose.

{"text": "Epitope-resolved profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response identifies cross-reactivity with endemic human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome shares regions of conservation with endemic human coronaviruses (CoVs), but it remains unknown to what extent these may be cross-recognized by the antibody response. Here, we study cross-reactivity using a highly multiplexed peptide assay (PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of IgG reactivity across all human CoVs in both COVID-19 convalescent and negative donors. PepSeq resolves epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins that are commonly targeted in convalescent donors, including several sites also recognized in some uninfected controls. By comparing patterns of homologous reactivity between CoVs and using targeted antibody-depletion experiments, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies that cross-recognize pandemic and endemic CoV antigens at two Spike S2 subunit epitopes. We further show that these cross-reactive antibodies preferentially bind endemic homologs. Our findings highlight sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 response appears to be shaped by previous CoV exposures and which have the potential to raise broadly neutralizing responses.

In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein mutants demonstrates the need for continuous screening of virus isolates. Due to the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolving in diverse human populations. Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 146,920 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 13.6% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the increasing importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Early Changes in Kidney Transplant Immunosuppression Regimens During the COVID-19 Pandemic. BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients have higher risk of infectious diseases due to their reliance on immunosuppression. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some clinicians might have opted for less potent immunosuppressive agents to counterbalance the novel infectious risk. We conducted a nationwide study to characterize immunosuppression use and subsequent clinical outcomes during the first 5 months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHOD(S): Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we studied all kidney-only recipients in the United States from January 1, 2017, to March 12, 2020 (\"prepandemic\" era; n=64849) and from March 13, 2020, to July 31, 2020 (\"pandemic\" era; n=5035). We compared the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents (versus basiliximab or no induction) and maintenance steroids (versus steroid avoidance/withdrawal) in the pandemic era compared with the prepandemic era. Then, we compared early posttransplant outcomes by immunosuppression regimen during the pandemic era. RESULT(S): Recipients in the pandemic era were substantially less likely to receive lymphocyte-depleting induction agents compared with their prepandemic counterparts (aOR=0.400.530.69); similar trends were found across subgroups of state-level COVID-19 incidence, donor type, and recipient age. However, lymphocyte-depleting induction agents were associated with decreased rejection during admission (aOR=0.110.230.47) but not with increased mortality in the pandemic era (aHR=0.130.471.66). On the other hand, the use of maintenance steroids versus early steroid withdrawal remained similar (aOR=0.711.071.62). CONCLUSION(S): The use of lymphocyte-depleting induction agents has decreased in favor of basiliximab and no induction during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this shift might have resulted in increases in rejection with no clear reductions in posttransplant mortality.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Objective: We examined the antibody response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a SARS-CoV 2 infection between the study interval of March 15, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Study Design: This was a prospective observational study examining the immune response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV 2 infection. Women with a SARS-CoV 2 infection were contacted via phone and scheduled for a phlebotomy visit to assess their antibody titer levels to COVID 19. The COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test was used to evaluate the patients' antibody titers. Result(s): 122 patients were identified as being diagnosed and delivered with SARS-CoV 2 in the pre-specified time frame. Of those patients, 25 women agreed to participate and were included in this study. 64.00% were Caucasian with an average age of 35 years. Demographic variables are illustrated in Table 1. The majority of women were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission (80.00 %) and the average gestational age of delivery and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 39 weeks gestation (Table 1). The later the gestational age at the time of diagnosis, the lower the antibody titer response (Table 2). When examining interval from diagnosis to antibody titer level, patients with the highest titers (2880) tended to have a shorter interval between their COVID-19 diagnosis and the time at which the titer level was drawn (73 vs 87 vs 77 days for patients with titers of 1:2880, 960 and 320 respectively). In addition, patients with symptoms on admission were slightly more likely to have a higher antibody titer level (80.00% of symptomatic patients had a reported antibody level of 960 or 2880). Conclusion(s): The antibody response among women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, appears to be greater when the patients are diagnosed at an earlier gestational age. Antibody titers were assessed greater than 4 weeks from the time of initial diagnosis, however beyond this time period the shorter the interval between diagnosis and assessment of antibody titer level, the more robust the apparent immune response.

{"text": "Liver injury in critically ill ECMO patients with COVID-19: A case series. Introduction: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a rapidly spreading pandemic. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has become a rescue therapy for some refractory critically ill patients. COVID-19 studies to date showed that patients with abnormal liver tests are at higher risk of progressing to severe disease1,2,3. ECMO patients being the most critically unwell patients, we have used our case series of all patients with COVID-19 on ECMO admitted to the intensive care unit to describe the dysfunction of blood liver tests and some potential causes. Method(s): We included into our case series a total of 18 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing VA/VV/VAV ECMO as rescue therapy at a university-affiliated tertiary care centre from March 1st to May 28th 2020. Liver test abnormalities were defined as the elevation of the following liver enzymes in serum: ALT >40 U/L, AST >40 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) >49 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) >135 U/L, and total bilirubin (TBIL) >17.1 lmol/L. Patients who had raised ALT and/or AST more than 3x the upper limit unit of normal (ULN) were classified as hepatocyte type; patients who had raised ALP or GGT twice the ULN were classified as cholangiocyte type; and patients who had a combination of both ALT/AST elevated more than 3x the ULN and ALP/ GGT twice the ULN were classified as mixed type. Result(s): Of the 18 patients mean age was 47.5(27-59)years with 94% being male.100% had abnormal liver results. No patient had documented liver disease prior to hospitalization. Average BMI was 30.4,64% having pre-existing T2DM and 52% having essential hypertension. Average APACHE2 Scores was 19[6-32]. 88% commenced VVECMO, 12% VA-ECMO with average duration of 30.4 days. 23% had a hepatocellular picture, 13% cholangiocyte, 11% mildly raised LFTs and 43% a mixed type picture. 83% had preserved synthetic function. On examination of causes, 70% had normal echocardiography, 11% global biventricular failure and 19% mild-moderately impaired RV function. 70.5% patients were on pipercillin/tazobactum, 47% clarithromycin, 41% co-amoxiclav 23% levofloxacin, 11.7% had oseltamivir at the time of the liver injury. 5% (1 patient) was on parenteral nutrition. 11.7% had documented fatty liver on US during their ICU stay. Mortality was 11.7%. Ferritin levels were wide ranging [390-38,000] with mean of 5800 and median of 3100. Average platelets count 150 x109/L. Conclusion(s): From previous studies, we know those who had abnormal liver test results, especially in hepatocyte type or mixed type, had significantly higher risks of developing severe disease secondary to SARS-CoV-2 3. 100% of our patients had abnormal liver tests while requiring ECMO representing the most critically unwell SARS-CoV-2 population.Mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocyte picture was the most prevalent at 43%, as seen in previous studies4 with no correlation between type of liver dysfunction and mortality.The liver dysfunction in our study was higher than previously reported3,4 and with no previous history of underlying liver disease, suggesting that liver damage in patients with coronavirus infection might be directly caused by the viral infection of liver cells as suggested by previous studies due to SARS-CoV-2 might directly binding to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function5. It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. There was no direct correlation appreciated between antimicrobials and liver dysfunction in our population.In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill3. Ferritin levels were wide ranging [390-38,000] with mean of 5800 suggesting systemic inflammatory process. High positive end expiratory pressure and aggressive ventilator strategies can cause RV strain/ pressure overload. While our patients had reduced ventilation on ECMO 33% had RV dysfunction. This right ventricular dysfunction can be associated with severe hepatic congestion. The primary pathophysiology involved in hepatic dysfunction is either passive congestion from increased filling pressures or low cardiac output and the consequences of impaired perfusion.Cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis may ensue compounding the insult6. It is important to identify RV strain on echo and avoid precipitating factors such as fluid overload and aggressive ventilation. Early consideration for extracorporeal support is important in these patients to avoid RV failure from medical management of respiratory failure. Our case series suggests that there might be concomitant liver injury as a consequence of the critical illness or than direct viral damage on the hepatocytes C19. Attention to modifiable factors and further research into liver injury in SARS-CoV-2 is key with the emphasis on clinical management of these severely ill patients that may consequently impact on liver function.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Generation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Virus for Viral Entry and Neutralization Assays: A 1-Week Protocol. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus requires reliable assays for studying viral entry mechanisms which remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important for the development of therapeutic approaches to control SARS-CoV-2 infection by permitting the screening for neutralizing antibodies and other agents that can block infection. This is particularly important for patients who are at high risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19. The production of pseudotyped viral particles may seem like a daunting task for a non-virology laboratory without experience in the two most commonly used pseudotyping systems, namely retro/lentiviruses and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which lacks the VSV envelope glycoprotein (VSVDELTAG). By incorporating the most up-to-date knowledge, we have developed a detailed, easy-to-follow novel protocol for producing SARS-CoV-2 spike-bearing pseudovirus using the VSV-DELTAG system. We describe the infection assay which uses GFP fluorescence as a measure of infection in a 24-well live imaging system. We present results of our optimization of the system to enhance viral infection levels through the over-expression of human ACE2 receptor and the overexpression of at least one of two proteases - TMPRSS2 or Furin, as well as, supplementation with Poloxamer 407 (P407) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as adjuvants. We show that the system works efficiently in three unrelated, clinically relevant cell lines: human 293T (renal epithelial) cells, human Calu-3 (lung epithelial) cells, and the non-human primate (African Green Monkey) cell line, Vero-E6 (renal epithelial) cells. In addition, we have used this system to show infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). This system is efficient (virus generation, titration, and infection assays can be performed in 1 week), quantitative, inexpensive, and readily scalable for application in drug development and therapeutic screening approaches.

The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and prognosis of CHF in this setting., METHODS: This single-center study included 829 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to April 2020. Patients with a previous history of CHF were matched 1:2 for age and sex. We analyze the prognostic value of pre-existing CHF. Prognostic implications of N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels on admission in the CHF cohort were explored., RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (43 CHF and 86 non-CHF) where finally included.

BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which is most frequently mild yet can be severe and lifethreatening. Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are predicted to reduce viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and prevent hospitalization. METHODS In this ongoing phase 2 trial involving outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate Covid-19, we randomly assigned 452 patients to receive a single intravenous infusion of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in one of three doses (700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg) or placebo and evaluated the quantitative virologic end points and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the viral load at day 11. The results of a preplanned interim analysis as of September 5, 2020, are reported here. RESULTS At the time of the interim analysis, the observed mean decrease from baseline in the log viral load for the entire population was-3.81, for an elimination of more than 99.97% of viral RNA. For patients who received the 2800-mg dose of LYCoV555, the difference from placebo in the decrease from baseline was-0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI],-0.98 to-0.08; P = 0.02), for a viral load that was lower by a factor of 3.4. Smaller differences from placebo in the change from baseline were observed among the patients who received the 700-mg dose (-0.20; 95% CI,-0.66 to 0.25; P = 0.38) or the 7000-mg dose (0.09; 95% CI,-0.37 to 0.55; P = 0.70). On days 2 to 6, the patients who received LY-CoV555 had a slightly lower severity of symptoms than those who received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a Covid-19-related hospitalization or visit to an emergency department was 1.6% in the LY-CoV555 group and 6.3% in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS In this interim analysis of a phase 2 trial, one of three doses of neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 appeared to accelerate the natural decline in viral load over time, whereas the other doses had not by day 11.

Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed for differentiating viral vs. bacterial infections. In COVID-19, some preliminary results have shown that PCT testing could act as a predictor of bacterial co-infection and be a useful marker for assessment of disease severity. We studied 83 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in whom PCT was specifically ordered by attending physicians. PCT results were evaluated according to the ability to accurately predict bacterial co-infections and death in comparison with other known biomarkers of infection and with major laboratory predictors of COVID-19 severity. Thirty-three (39.8%) patients suffered an in-hospital bacterial co-infection and 44 (53.0%) patients died. In predicting bacterial co-infection, PCT showed a relatively low accuracy (area under receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC]: 0.757; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.651-0.845), with a strength for detecting the outcome not significantly different from that of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). In predicting patient death, PCT showed an AUC of 0.815 (CI: 0.714-0.892), not better than those of other more common laboratory tests, such as blood lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.874, p=0.19), serum lactate dehydrogenase (AUC: 0.860, p=0.47), blood neutrophil count (AUC: 0.845, p=0.59), and serum albumin (AUC: 0.839, p=0.73). Procalcitonin (PCT) testing, even when appropriately ordered, did not provide a significant added value in COVID-19 patients when compared with more consolidated biomarkers of infection and poor clinical outcome. The major application of PCT in COVID-19 is its ability, associated with a negative predictive value >90%, to exclude a bacterial co-infection when a rule-out cut-off (<0.25 mug/L) is applied.

{"text": "COVID-19 and pediatric asthma: Clinical and management challenges. Asthma is the most frequent chronic condition in childhood and a current concern exists about asthma in the pediatric population and its risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-alpha production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma-obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions. Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease. Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Focus on asthma control, risk stratification, and medication adherence will be essential to allow children with asthma to return safely to school.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Various non-pharmaceutical interventions were adopted by countries worldwide in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with adverse socioeconomic side effects, which raises the question about their differential effectiveness. We estimate the average dynamic effect of each intervention on the incidence of COVID-19 and on people's whereabouts by developing a statistical model that accounts for the contemporaneous adoption of multiple interventions. Using daily data from 175 countries, we show that, even after controlling for other concurrent lockdown policies, cancelling public events, imposing restrictions on private gatherings and closing schools and workplaces had significant effects on reducing COVID-19 infections. Restrictions on internal movement and public transport had no effects because the aforementioned policies, imposed earlier on average, had already de facto reduced human mobility. International travel restrictions, although imposed early, had a short-lived effect failing to prevent the epidemic from turning into a pandemic because they were less stringent. We interpret the impact of each intervention on containing the pandemic using a conceptual framework which relies on their effects on human mobility behaviors in a manner consistent with time-use and epidemiological factors.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Lombardy, the most populated and industrialized Italian region, was the epicentre of the first wave (March and April, 2020) of COVID-19 in Italy and it is among the most air polluted areas of Europe. We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1,439 municipalities out of 1,507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20th to April 16th and from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 mug/m3 in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 mug/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO2 levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality.

{"text": "A novel COVID-19 epidemiological model with explicit susceptible and asymptomatic isolation compartments reveals unexpected consequences of timing social distancing. Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic \"socially distant\" populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing distancing mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight \"window of opportunity\" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections - so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines - action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.

{"text": "Insights into the evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets and aerosols: Levitation experiments and numerical modeling. Understanding the transmission phenomena of SARS-CoV-2 by virus-laden droplets and aerosols is of paramount importance for controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 degreeC to 29 degreeC and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated. The numerical predictions may be used to determine the impact of the droplet size and the ambient conditions on the transmission risks of infectious diseases like COVID-19.

We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in health care, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown., STUDY DESIGN: The study design of this study is a retrospective cohort study and causal inference methods., METHODS: In population-based electronic health records for 1,958,638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk ('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating (i) pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii) population infection rate and (iii) relative impact on mortality (relative risk [RR]: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease), accounting for confounders., RESULTS: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, and indirect effect of 383-767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR = 1.2. Owing to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97,755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434,104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year., CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of obesity and promotion of physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.

{"text": "Patient and carer satisfaction of outpatient video conference services during COVID-19 restrictions: A rural medical oncology perspective. Background: COVID-19 regional boarder closures in Western Australia necessitated novel approaches to rural health care delivery. Visiting consultants were required to curtail their service to regional centres to abide with government and health department directives. In response, a TeleHealth VideoConferencing outpatient service to facilitate standards of care was rapidly implemented. The study aimed to develop an understanding of client and carer perception of the service and seek opinion regarding futuremodels of outpatient care provision. Method(s): All 254 Great Southern Cancer Service patients who engaged in VideoConference outpatient services from March to June 2020 were mailed surveys. Survey design included 13 qualitative Likert scale and 7 quantitative questions. Retrospective data interrogation provided demographic and cohort cancer information. Analysis included descriptive statistical and thematic methodologies. Result(s): The most prevalent cancers were breast (33%) and urogenital (20%). The mean age of respondents was 71 years. New patients to the clinic accounted for 17% of the cohort. Over 80% believed care was well organised with good coherence amongst the staff. However, only 60% were satisfied with the overall experience. Thematic analysis revealed five major themes including, Getting On, Despite Covid-19, Compromising the Patient/Physician Relationship and Dissatisfaction with Technology. In regard to the preferred future model of outpatient care, 65% requested face-to-face consultations. Only 5% requested solely VideoConference in the future. Conclusion(s): Gratitude abound for availability of cancer services during a challenging period. However, overall satisfaction with the novel service was modest. Dissatisfaction arose from perceived loss of patient/physician rapport, internet deficits and being unable to fully engage with technology.

{"text": "De novo design of modular and tunable protein biosensors. Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; binding of the analyte of interest drives switching from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-193, we used the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a signal over background of over 50-fold. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Pandemic and its psychological impact on healthcare professionals in pediatric hematology and oncology ward. Background: There is a growing concern about psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and we established a mental health safety-net to support medical professionals not only working in frontline but also in pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) ward. Method(s): We performed a semi-structured interview and questionnaire survey during the state of emergency 2020. Result(s): We completed questionnaire surveys from 27 nurses, 18 physicians, 2 nursery nurses, and 5 therapists, respectively. We have successfully controlled nosocomial outbreak even in the midst of the pandemic and found that high confidence in infection control is a fundamental element to facilitate their willingness of working in AGMC, one of the Hyogo Prefectural tertiary infectious disease centers. In general, medical professionals were relatively resilient with a strong belief to overcome the current crisis, but are still under overwhelming anxiety in themselves, especially about being infected to become an asymptomatic carrier who might pass the virus to younger vulnerable patients. Discussion(s): Given that complete obedience of preventative principles such as \"avoiding 3 Cs\" (Closed spaces, Crowded places, Close-contact) is not always feasible inPHOward, it would be possible that the healthcare professionals will be under psychological pressure in the possible future epidemics. We suggest that leveraging an institutional care guideline to simultaneously promote self-care educational activities represents a promising strategic approach to mitigate the psychological problems in PHO ward.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Working conditions and health status of 6,317 front line public health workers across five provinces in China during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Public health workers at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and primary health care institutes (PHIs) were among the main workers who implemented prevention, control, and containment measures. However, their efforts and health status have not been well documented. We aimed to investigate the working conditions and health status of front line public health workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD(S): Between 18 February and 1 March 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of 2,313 CDC workers and 4,004 PHI workers in five provinces across China experiencing different scales of COVID-19 epidemic. We surveyed all participants about their work conditions, roles, burdens, perceptions, mental health, and self-rated health using a self-constructed questionnaire and standardised measurements (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder scale). To examine the independent associations between working conditions and health outcomes, we used multivariate regression models controlling for potential confounders. RESULT(S): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and poor self-rated health was 21.3, 19.0, and 9.8%, respectively, among public health workers (27.1, 20.6, and 15.0% among CDC workers and 17.5, 17.9, and 6.8% among PHI workers). The majority (71.6%) made immense efforts in both field and non-field work. Nearly 20.0% have worked all night for more than 3 days, and 45.3% had worked throughout the Chinese New Year holiday. Three risk factors and two protective factors were found to be independently associated with all three health outcomes in our final multivariate models: working all night for >3 days (multivariate odds ratio [ORm]=1.67~1.75, p<0.001), concerns about infection at work (ORm=1.46~1.89, p<0.001), perceived troubles at work (ORm=1.10~1.28, p<0.001), initiating COVID-19 prevention work after January 23 (ORm=0.78~0.82, p=0.002~0.008), and ability to persist for > 1 month at the current work intensity (ORm=0.44~0.55, p<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Chinese public health workers made immense efforts and personal sacrifices to control the COVID-19 epidemic and faced the risk of mental health problems. Efforts are needed to improve the working conditions and health status of public health workers and thus maintain their morale and effectiveness during the fight against COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

This article aims to provide guidance on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in patients with genetic obesity. Key principals of the management of patients with genetic obesity during COVID-19 pandemic for patients that have contracted COVID-19 are to be aware of: possible adrenal insufficiency (e.g., POMC deficiency, PWS); a more severe course in patients with concomitant immunodeficiency (e.g., LEP and LEPR deficiency), although defective leptin signalling could also be protective against the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19; disease severity being masked by insufficient awareness of symptoms in syndromic obesity patients with intellectual deficit (in particular PWS); to adjust medication dose to increased body size, preferably use dosing in m2; the high risk of malnutrition in patients with Sars-Cov2 infection, even in case of obesity. Key principals of the obesity management during the pandemic are to strive for optimal obesity management and a healthy lifestyle within the possibilities of the regulations to prevent weight (re)gain and to address anxiety within consultations, since prevalence of anxiety for COVID-19 is underestimated.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Psychological distress among Italians during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine. Background: Quarantine as a preventive action to reduce people's exposure to a contagious disease has substantial psychological impact. We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14 days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Result(s): In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18-50 years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with >=3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a <=2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14 days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (rs = + 0.83, p = < 0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (rs = + 0.91, p = < 0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25 km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15 km. Conclusion(s): Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine's adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.Copyright \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations represents an emergency for neurosurgery and neuro-interventional departments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown., MATERIAL AND METHOD: s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population., RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant. GCS upon admission was 3-8 in 44 % of cases in 2020 (41 patients), 39.7 % in 2019 (46 patients) and 28 % in 2018 (27 patients)., CONCLUSION: Reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 lockdown was not confirmed. Nevertheless, some patients reached the emergency rooms only several days after symptoms onset, resulting in a worse clinical condition at admission. Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.

BACKGROUND: The UK has been one of the European countries most affected by COVID-19 pandemic. The UK implemented a lockdown in March 2020, when testing policy at the time was focusing on hospitalised cases. Limited information is therefore available on the impact of the lockdown on point prevalence in the community. We assessed COVID-19 point prevalence in London between early April and early May 2020, which approximately reflect infection around the time of the lockdown and 3-5 weeks into lockdown. METHOD(S): We tested 1064 participants of a community surveillance cohort for acute COVID-19 infection using PCR in London in April and May 2020 and described positivity as well as characteristics and symptoms of the participants. RESULT(S): Point prevalence decreased from 2.2% (95% CI 1.4 to 3.5) in early April to 0.2% (95% CI 0.03 to 1.6) in early May. 22% of those who tested positive in April were asymptomatic. Extrapolation from reports of confirmed cases suggest that 5-7.6% of total infections were confirmed by testing during this period. CONCLUSION(S): COVID-19 point prevalence in the community sharply decreased after lockdown was implemented. This study is based on a small sample and regular seroprevalence studies are needed to better characterise population-level immunity.Copyright \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

{"text": "Case Report: Postacute Rehabilitation of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Cerebral Vasculitis-Like Pattern Accompanied by SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Introduction: The main clinical manifestation of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is respiratory issues. Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements. Subsequently the patient was admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit, where he received an intensive rehabilitation treatment consisting of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Two months later the patient was discharged at home and able to walk independently even for long distances thanks to the use of Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO). Conclusion:  In this report, we present the case of a patient with peripheral and central neurological damage occurred later severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2. The Immunoglobulin G therapy allowed the patient to benefit considerably from early rehabilitation, reaching the walking, increasing the independence in daily living tasks, and enabling safe discharge from hospital to home. Related neurologic complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection suffer a lack of understanding and further investigations should be conducted.

Background: Lung ultrasound (LU) is becoming an increasingly important diagnostic tool in detecting lung involvement in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to ascertain the likelihood of finding LU abnormalities; mimicking lung involvement; in COVID-19 negative healthy individuals. Methods: We performed LU on 265 healthcare workers; not presenting COVID-19 major symptoms and in good health; during the course of a serological screening program for COVID-19 in our General Hospital. LU results were reported as total Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) using a 12-zone method of reporting. Results: 250/265 subjects were included in the COVID-19 negative group. LU was not completely normal (LUS not equal 0) in 65/250 COVID-19 negative subjects (26%) and in 12/15 (80%) poorly symptomatic COVID-19 positive subjects; with a multifocal pattern in 12.7% vs. 66.7% of cases respectively. Age and COVID-19 positivity were independent predictors of total LUS. A total LUS >= 2 had a sensitivity of 66.67% and a specificity of 85.60% in detecting COVID-19 positivity.

Method(s): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interim biosafety guidelines continue to be updated. Presented here are additional considerations intended to complement the interim guidance. These considerations draw on prior SARS recommendations and recent COVID-19 reports. Result(s): SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been detected in various biospecimen types; however, studies are needed to determine whether viral load indicates viable virus. Throughout the pandemic, biospecimens will be collected for various purposes from COVID-19 known and suspected cases, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Current data suggest the pandemic start may be as early as October 2019; thus, all biospecimens collected since could be considered potentially infectious. Conclusion(s): All entities handling these biospecimens should do risk assessments in accordance with institutional policies and adhere to any guidance provided. The scientific community has a responsibility to safely handle and maintain all biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon, it will be imperative to convene expert working groups to address the current and long-term storage and use of these biospecimens.

BACKGROUND: The mental health impact of the pandemic after the initial lockdowns has not been well studied in the USA. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the adult US population. METHOD(S): A multi-item, valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit adult US participants in the general population across the USA. A total of 1978 individuals participated in the study, where the majority were: females (51%), whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%) and with a bachelor's degree or higher (78%). RESULT(S): The prevalence of depression (39%), anxiety (42%) and psychological distress (39%) were computed from the PHQ-4 scale. In multiple regression analyses, depression, anxiety and psychological distress burden (assessed by PHQ-4 scale) was predicted significantly based on race, ethnicity, age, having children at home, employment as a healthcare worker, annual household income and area of residence. Males were more likely to have depression, and females were more likely to have anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION(S): Given the high prevalence of depression and anxiety, interdisciplinary and multisectoral approaches are recommended in the USA along with population-based interventions on mental health improvement.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Factors associated with the level of prenatal anxiety were analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: The prenatal anxiety prevalence in this population was 20.8%. The mean score of knowledge was 13.2 +/- 1.1 on a 0 ~ 14 scale. The attitudes and practices data showed that 580/ 817 (71.0%) were very concerned about the news of COVID-19, 455/817 (55.7%) considered the official media to be the most reliable information source for COVID-19, and 681/817 (83.4%) were anxious about the possibility of being infected by COVID-19. However, only 83/817 (10.2%) worried about contracting COVID-19 infection through the ultrasound transducer during a routing morphology scan. About two-thirds 528/817 (64.6%) delayed or canceled the antenatal visits. Approximately half of them 410/817 (50.2%) used two kinds of personal protection equipments (PPEs) during hospital visits.

{"text": "Increased Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 to Antibody Neutralization. The Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, continues to rage. Prospects of ending this pandemic rest on the development of effective interventions. Two monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have received emergency use authorization, and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise, including two with ~95% protective efficacy against Covid-19. However, these interventions were directed toward the initial SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in 2019. Considerable viral evolution has occurred since, including variants with a D614G mutation that have become dominant. Viruses with this mutation alone do not appear to be antigenically distinct, however. Recent emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. We now report that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike and relatively resistant to a number of mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). It is modestly more resistant to convalescent plasma (~3 fold) and vaccinee sera (~2 fold). Findings on B.1.351 are more worrisome in that this variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also by multiple potent mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, largely due to an E484K mutation. Moreover, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (~11-33 fold) and vaccinee sera (~6.5-8.6 fold). B.1.351 and emergent variants with similar spike mutations present new challenges for mAb therapy and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: There are varying reports of the prevalence and effect of comorbid asthma in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. We sought to conduct a meta-analysis comparing asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients to determine the clinical significance of pre-existing asthma in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources: Online databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched up to July 15, 2020, for papers comparing asthma versus non-asthma COVID-19 patients. Study Selection: According to prespecified inclusion criteria, this analysis included eleven retrospective studies with 107,983 COVID-19 patients. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age groups. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.9 years (95%CI =51.9-67.9). Across studies, the prevalence of asthma was 11.2% (95%CI: 9.1%-13.3%) among COVID-19 patients who attended the hospitals. Asthma patients were more likely to be younger (SMD=-0.36, 95%CI=-0.61 to -0.10, p = 0.005), and obese (OR =1.98, 95%CI =1.54-2.55, p < 0.001), there was no differential risk of hospitalization rate, ICU admission, or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts. However, asthmatic patients had increased risk of endotracheal intubation (RR =1.27, 95%CI =1.02-1.58, p = 0.030) especially patients aged <50 years (RR =6.68, 95%CI =1.76-11.13, p = 0.009). Despite this result, asthmatic patients had better recovery with a higher liability of being discharged and were less likely to die (RR =0.80, 95%CI =0.65-0.97, p = 0.026). Conclusion:  To our knowledge, our meta-analysis is the largest to shed light on pre-existing asthma as a predictor of intubation in COVID-19, especially in young and obese patients.

Mental health status was assessed by the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7, and insomnia severity index (ISI) questionnaires to detect depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively., RESULTS: We included 307 patients in the survey. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent diagnosis (55%). Of all participants, 7.5% had known depression and 5.5% known anxiety. Mental health disorders were insomnia (34.9%), anxiety (33.2%), and depression (24.4%). Major symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression were noted in respectively, 19.9%, 12.4%, and 7.8% of participants. Risk factors for major insomnia were male gender (OR= 4.36, 95% CI 2.06 to 9.25; p<0.0001), low socioeconomic status (OR= 2.64, 95% CI 1.44 - 4.83; p<0.002) and having rheumatoid arthritis (OR= 2.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.84; p<0.036). Major anxiety was associated with low monthly income (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.01; p<0.026), and higher Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain (OR=1.795, 95% CI 1.074 to 2.994 ; p<0.026). Major depression was associated with worsening of rheumatic disease (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.26; p<0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of undiagnosed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was found in rheumatic patients. Rheumatologists should be aware of these comorbidities, especially in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Spontaneous ilio-psoas haematomas (IPHs): a warning for COVID-19 inpatients. INTRODUCTION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing a hypercoagulable state due to haemostatic changes directly related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the consequence of the cytokine storm. Anticoagulation is now recommended to reduce the thrombotic risk. Ilio-psoas haematoma (IPH) is a potentially lethal condition that can arise during the hospitalization, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) and frequently reported as a complication of anticoagulation treatment., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a case series of seven subjects with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia complicated by Ilio-psoas haematomas (IPHs) at our COVID-Hospital in Rome, Italy., RESULTS: Over the observation period, 925 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our COVID-hospital. Among them, we found seven spontaneous IPHs with an incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 hospitalization. All the reported cases had a severe manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, with at least one comorbidity and 5/7 were on treatment with low weight molecular heparin for micro or macro pulmonary thrombosis., CONCLUSIONS: Given the indications to prescribe anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 and the lack of solid evidences on the optimal dose and duration, it is important to be aware of the iliopsoas haematoma as a potentially serious complication in COVID-19 inpatients. KEY MESSAGE Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of hypercoagulability state and anticoagulation therapy is recommended. Ilio-psoas haematoma (IPH) is found to be a complication of anticoagulation regimen especially in severe COVID-19 cases. An incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 admission of IPHs was reported. Hypoesthesia of the lower limbs, pain triggered by femoral rotation, hypovolaemia and anaemia are the most common symptoms and signs of IPHs that should alert physician.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of reduced doses of Ad26.COV2.S. 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1\u00d710 11 , 5\u00d710 10 , 1.125\u00d710 10 , or 2\u00d710 9 vp Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes. Vaccine doses as low as 2\u00d710 9 vp provided robust protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125\u00d710 10 vp were required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells as well as binding and neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not show evidence of virologic, immunologic, histopathologic, or clinical enhancement of disease compared with sham controls. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with a relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Moreover, our findings show that a higher vaccine dose may be required for protection in the upper respiratory tract compared with the lower respiratory tract.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19: rapid review and meta-analysis. Background: The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance. Objective(s): The aim was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9 2020. Study Eligibility Criteria: We included randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >=10 patients; and experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. Participant(s): The study participants were patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all healthcare settings (hospital and community) and age groups (paediatric and adult). Method(s): The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. Result(s): We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30 623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3-80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33) compared with adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95% CI 1.18-1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95% CI 1.15-1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. Conclusion(s): Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection.

{"text": "Examination of Air Pollution's Relationship with COVID-19, Physical and Mental Health. Air pollution is a result of natural phenomena or human activities that can cause the release of harmful substances in the environment, leading to adverse health outcomes among living beings. Pollution is associated with adverse health impacts on multiple organ systems among humans. While the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are mainly affected, there are other health issues related to the eyes, skin, brain, blood, immunity, behavioral/mental well-being, and reproduction among exposed individuals. Air pollutants can especially have higher health impacts on people at the extremes of their ages (children and elderly) and on those suffering from underlying respiratory and heart issues. Pollutants such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide have respiratory effects among children and adults and are associated with increased respiratory diseases, asthma exacerbations, and related hospitalizations. Carbon monoxide interferes with transporting oxygen by forming carboxyhemoglobin leading to cardiovascular, neurological, and respiratory problems. Particulate matter is a heterogeneous mixture of tiny particles of varying compositions found in the atmosphere and has a wide variety of severe health effects. Particulate matter emits from combustion, diesel engines, power generation, and wood-burning, and certain industrial activities. Lead is considered neurotoxic and has more severe consequences among children. Here we summarize characteristics of six criteria air pollutants and associated air quality risk assessment parameters known as the Pollutant Standard Index (PSI). The present manuscript also examines the impact of air pollution on human behavior, mental well-being, and neurological health consequences, as air pollution has been associated with cognitive decline, hyperactivity, dementia, anxiety, depression, aggression, and Alzheimer's disease-related changes. Lastly, we also attempt to look into any relationship between air pollutants and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and examine its possible association with a higher COVID-19 incidence, complications, and mortality.

{"text": "Detailed view on repurposed drugs, tracking of vaccines,and brief view on prophylactic nanomedicines as an alternative approach and patient care for covid-19. In December 2019, a rare case of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. This was later analyzed and known to have similar characteristics as viral pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus. Later, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease as COVID19. The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) ought to taint both the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. This COVID-19 is spreading quickly with an immense rise in cases around the world. This infection's mechanism stays obscure, and the medications explicit for the infection were not grown at this point. Infection is highly contagious. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is one of seven kinds of crown infection, including the one which causes severe maladies like Middle East respiratory disorder (MERS) and abrupt, intense respiratory syndrome(SARS). Since its revelation, the infection has spread and has caused anxiety and fear among people. Recent vaccines are tracked, and clinical trials can bring an immediate protocol on a medication approach. By including different therapeutic approaches, it is easier to combat the disease quickly. With very low mortality and high transmission rate, new approaches to vaccines and nanomedicines bring down the spread. Controlled patient care is also crucial. On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease as 'global pandemic'. COVID-19, therefore, poses a significant threat to global public health. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic methods. The review also focuses on repurposed drugs, traced vaccines, and a quick view of prophylactic nanomedicines as an alternative for COVID 19. For this review, the complete database has been collected from various search engines such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Elsevier, etc., from the year 2001-2020 using the following keywords.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to human health, health care systems, public life, and economy around the globe. The repertoire of effective therapies for severe courses of the disease has remained limited. A large proportion of the world population suffers from vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, with prevalence being particularly high among the COVID-19 high-risk populations. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as a potential option to prevent COVID-19 infections, severe courses, and deaths from the disease, but is not widely practiced. This article provides an up-to-date summary of recent epidemiological and intervention studies on a possible role of vitamin D supplementation for preventing severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Despite limitations and remaining uncertainties, accumulating evidence strongly supports widespread vitamin D supplementation, in particular of high-risk populations, as well as high-dose supplementation of those infected. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefit-risk ratio of such supplementation calls for immediate action even before results of ongoing large-scale randomized trials become available.Copyright \u00a9 2021 by the author.

{"text": "Benefit of cognitive stimulation therapy in a patient with vascular dementia: A case report. BACKGROUND: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a restoration therapy based on cognitive improvement of patients, by giving patients a variety of stimulation. This therapy is highly recommended for people with mild dementia from mild to moderate in either Alzheimer dementia or vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a collection of symptoms of decreased cognitive abilities associated with the incidence of stroke. CASE REPORT: Reported a 76-year-old man, who had a bleeding stroke, in admission the patient were often angry, sleepless, and aphasic. After returning home the patient experienced impairment in memory, language, executive ability, mild to moderate degree of visuospatial and incapable to manage his daily activities, therefore in routine evaluation of the 3rd month, patient was diagnosed as Vascular cognitive impairment. On regular home visits until the 6th month after the stroke, it was reported that in the first 6 months had been received CST. However, in the 7th-9th month of CST because at the time of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, human interaction was severely restricted, so patient monitoring was carried out using Ina AD-8 through phone. An evaluation of the cognitive function by measuring the cognitive function of the patient was using the Indonesian version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-Ina), as well as using activity daily living and instrumental daily living activities to measure the patient's independence function. After 6 months of CST, there were cognitive improvements and were seen in MoCA - Ina, Ina AD-8 followed by improved patient independence. CONCLUSION(S): Cognitive stimulation is the best intervention option in the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia. This case is one good example that shows the success of CST that has been observed for 9 months, not only on the cognitive component but also in terms of the ability to perform daily activities.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Billy Salvatore Soedirman, Anak Agung Ayu Putri Laksmidewi.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: As the world is busy addressing COVID-19, road traffic injuries, another major cause of deaths is continuously killing people on the roads. In Nepal, there were frequent media reports of occurrences of road crashes, injuries, and deaths despite nationwide lockdown. This paper aims to describe the situation of road traffic crashes and casualties during the period of complete lockdown. Methods: This study used secondary data from two sources: Nepal Police and media reports between 24 March and 14 June 2020 (because the government lifted the nationwide lockdown from 15 June 2020). Available details of crashes, deaths, and injuries for this period were extracted from media reports and the summary data that was obtained from the Police. Narrative comparison is done between the data for the same period from both the sources, where possible. Results: Nepal Police recorded 1,801 incidents of road crashes during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown with 256 deaths (on average 3.1 deaths daily) and 1,824 injuries (on average 22.2 injuries daily). Motorcycles comprised over 21% of all vehicles involved in crashes. Ambulances and other vehicles for essential services were also found to be involved in crashes. Speeding itself was the cause for almost a quarter of the incidents during the lockdown. Conclusions: Even when the movement restrictions were imposed in Nepal, the number of road crashes was not substantially reduced. Media reports were mainly found to be reporting the crashes where deaths occurred, but police records also included nonfatal injuries. The incidence of crashes in this period shows that it is important to work for road safety to save lives from road traffic crashes in Nepal.

OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of cranial multineuritis after severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2., METHODS: Patients' data were obtained from medical records of the clinical chart of dell'Angelo Hospital, Venice, Italy., RESULTS: The first patient is a 42-year-old male patient who developed, 10 days after the resolution of coronavirus-2 pneumonia and intensive care unit hospitalization with hyperactive delirium, a cranial multineuritis with asymmetric distribution (bilateral hypoglossus involvement and right Claude Bernard Horner syndrome). No albumin-cytologic dissociation was found in cerebrospinal fluid; severe bilateral denervation was detected in hypoglossus nerve, with normal EMG of other cranial muscles, blink reflex, and cerebral magnetic resonance with gadolinium. He presented a striking improvement after intravenous human immunoglobulin therapy. The second case is a 67-year-old male patient who developed a cranial neuritis (left hypoglossus paresis), with dyslalia and deglutition difficulties. He had cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities (albumin-cytologic dissociation), no involvement of ninth and 10th cranial nerves, diffuse hyporeflexia, and brachial diparesis., DISCUSSION: Cranial neuritis is a possible neurological manifestation of coronavirus-2 pneumonia. Etiology is not clear: it is possible a direct injury of the nervous structures by the virus through olfactory nasopharyngeal terminations.

We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US)., METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 95% against disease following 2 doses administered 21 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population within 284 days. We varied vaccine efficacy against infection, and specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario. The model was calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.2, accounting for current non-pharmaceutical interventions in the US., RESULTS: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 4.6% (95% CrI: 4.3% - 5.0%) from 9.0% (95% CrI: 8.4% - 9.4%) without vaccination, over 300 days. The highest relative reduction (54-62%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 63.5% (95% CrI: 60.3% - 66.7%), 65.6% (95% CrI: 62.2% - 68.6%), and 69.3% (95% CrI: 65.5% - 73.1%), respectively, across the same period., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks, even with limited protection against infection.

The 2019 SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has illustrated the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests. In this work, a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) biosensor platform was used to rapidly and accurately measure antibodies against COVID-19 in human blood serum and dried blood spot samples. The GC-FP platform measures antibody-antigen binding interactions for multiple targets in a single sample, and has 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The GC-FP platform yielded a quantitative, linear response for serum samples diluted to as low as 1:1600 dilution. Test results were highly correlated with two commercial COVID-19 antibody tests, including an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay. To demonstrate test efficacy with other sample matrices, dried blood spot samples (n = 63) were obtained and evaluated with GC-FP, yielding 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection. The test was also evaluated for detection of multiple immunoglobulin isotypes, with successful detection of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody-antigen interactions.

Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 min and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined., Methods: The diagnostic value of the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.Findings : 1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n = 139) and 30.3% (n = 63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7-100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0-89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms.

STUDY QUESTION: How is the semen quality of sexually active men following recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Twenty-five percent of the men with recent SARS-Cov-2 infections and proven healing were oligo-crypto-azoospermic, despite the absence of virus RNA in semen., WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human semen and its role in virus contagion and semen quality after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unclear. So far, studies evaluating semen quality and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of infected or proven recovered men are scarce and included a limited number of participants., STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A prospective cross-sectional study on 43 sexually active men who were known to have recovered from SARS-CoV2 was performed. Four biological fluid samples, namely saliva, pre-ejaculation urine, semen and post-ejaculation urine, were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Female partners were retested if any specimen was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Routine semen analysis and quantification of semen leukocytes and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were performed., PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Questionnaires including International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Short Form were administered to all subjects. The occurrence of virus RNA was evaluated in all the biological fluids collected by RT-PCR. Semen parameters were evaluated according to the World Health Organization manual edition V. Semen IL-8 levels were evaluated by a two-step ELISA method., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After recovery from COVID-19, 25% of the men studied were oligo-crypto-azoospermic. Of the 11 men with semen impairment, eight were azoospermic and three were oligospermic. A total of 33 patients (76.7%) showed pathological levels of IL-8 in semen. Oligo-crypto-azoospermia was significantly related to COVID-19 severity (p < 0.001). Three patients (7%) tested positive for at least one sample (one saliva; one pre-ejaculation urine; one semen and one post-ejaculation urine), so the next day new nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The results from these three patients and their partners were all negative for SARS-CoV-2., LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although crypto-azoospermia was found in a high percentage of men who had recovered from COVID-19, clearly exceeding the percentage found in the general population, the previous semen quality of these men was unknown, nor is it known whether a recovery of testicular function was occurring. The low number of enrolled patients may limit the statistical power of study., WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva, urine and semen in a small percentage of men who recovered from COVID-19. One-quarter of men who recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated oligo-crypto-azoospermia indicating that an assessment of semen quality should be recommended for men of reproductive age who are affected by COVID-19., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: n/a.

{"text": "COVID-19: a new burden of respiratory disease among South African miners?. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mineworkers in South Africa experience a triple burden of disease due to their distinct work experience. Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AIMS: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a still growing pandemic, causing many deaths and socio-economic damage. Elevated expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or Influenza associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499) were analyzed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Calculating the area under the curve (AUC) using ROC-analysis miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 showed a clear distinction between COVID-19 and Influenza-ARDS patients. CONCLUSION(S): In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocyte-specific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Importantly, miR profiles were able to differentiate between severely ill, mechanically-ventilated Influenza-ARDS and COVID-19 patients, indicating a rather specific response and cardiac involvement of COVID-19.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Is recurrence possible in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Case series and systematic review of literature. Can a patient diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) be infected again? This question is still unsolved. We tried to analyze local and literature cases with a positive respiratory swab after recovery. We collected data from symptomatic patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Italian Umbria Region that, after recovery, were again positive for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract specimens. Samples were also assessed for infectivity in vitro. A systematic review of similar cases reported in the literature was performed. The study population was composed of 9 patients during a 4-month study period. Among the new positive samples, six were inoculated in Vero-E6 cells and showed no growth and negative molecular test in culture supernatants. All patients were positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and/or S protein. Conducting a review of the literature, 1350 similar cases have been found. The presumptive reactivation occurred in 34.5 days on average (standard deviation, SD, 18.7 days) after COVID-19 onset, when the 5.6% of patients presented fever and the 27.6% symptoms. The outcome was favorable in 96.7% of patients, while the 1.1% of them were still hospitalized at the time of data collection and the 2.1% died. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain new positive respiratory samples after confirmed negativity. According to this study, the phenomenon seems to be due to the prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces in respiratory samples of recovered patients. The failure of the virus to replicate in vitro suggests its inability to replicate in vivo.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Facial palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To compare the incidence and clinical features of individuals presenting in emergency rooms (ER) with facial palsy during the Italian COVID-19 outbreak and in the same period of 2019. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for all accesses to the six ER in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (27 February-3 May 2020) to identify all cases of diagnosed facial palsy. Clinical information was retrieved for each patient and compared with that of facial palsy cases presenting in 2019. Result(s): Between 27 February and 3 May 2020, 38 patients presented to provincial ERs for facial palsy; in 2019, there were 22 cases, for an incidence rate ratio of 1.73 (95% CI 1.02-2.92) for the 2020 cohort. Of the 2020 cohort, eight patients (21%) presented with active or recent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, compared with 2 (9%) in 2019 (p =.299); one was tested and resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, patients were younger (-11 years, p =.037) than those of the previous year and manifested a longer lag (+1.1 days, p =.001) between symptoms onset and ER presentation. Conclusion(s): We observed a higher occurrence of facial palsy during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the same period of the previous year; 21% of patients presenting with facial palsy had active or recent symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an excess risk of facial palsy during or after COVID-19. These patients searched for medical attention later, probably because of the fear of contracting COVID-19 during assistance.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Association between circulating furin levels, obesity and pro-inflammatory markers in children. AIM: To, in children, investigate associations between serum furin, obesity, overweight, body fat and circulating markers reflecting adipose tissue or systemic inflammation., METHODS: We analyzed furin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, triglycerides, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein in serum from 166 children in the Pediatric Osteoporosis Prevention (POP) study collected at mean age (SD) 9.9 (0.6) years. Children were classified as low-to-normal weight, overweight or obese. Total body fat mass (kg), trunk fat mass (kg) and total body lean mass (kg) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body fat percentage (%) was calculated., RESULTS: We found that circulating furin levels were higher in children with obesity and overweight compared to children with low-to-normal weight (p<0.001 and p=0.006 respectively). Also, there were positive correlations between circulating furin, total body fat mass, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, triglycerides, adipokines and pro-inflammatory markers., CONCLUSION: This study indicates associations between furin, adiposity, and a pro-inflammatory milieu in children. We suggest that future studies investigate the role of furin in fat tissue inflammation and associated increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases in children. Studies should also investigate if higher furin levels could be a link between obesity and severe coronavirus disease 2019 in children. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report. BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia is a widespread genetic disease prevalent worldwide among African and African-American populations. The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known., CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital., CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Demographic shift in COVID-19 patients in Singapore from an aged, at-risk population to young migrant workers with reduced risk of severe disease. Objectives: The vast majority of COVID-19 cases in Singapore have occurred amongst migrant workers. This paper examined trends in the hospitalised cases and tested the assumption that the low severity of disease was related to the relatively young affected population. Method(s): All patients with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 admitted from February to April 2020 were divided into: (i) imported cases, (ii) locally-transmitted cases outside migrant worker dormitories and (iii) migrant worker dormitory cases. They were examined for underlying comorbidities, clinical progress and outcomes. Result(s): Imported cases (n = 29) peaked in mid-March 2020, followed by local cases (n = 100) in mid-April 2020; migrant worker cases (n = 425) continued to increase in late April 2020. Migrant worker cases were younger, had few medical comorbidities and less severe disease. As the migrant worker cases increased, the proportion of patients with pneumonia decreased, whilst patients presenting earlier in their illness and asymptomatic disease became more common. Conclusion(s): Singapore experienced a substantial shift in the population at risk of severe COVID-19. Successful control in the community protected an aging population. Large migrant worker dormitory outbreaks occurred, but the disease incurred was less severe, resulting in Singapore having one of the lowest case fatality rates in the world.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Respiratory infections during lithium and valproate medication: a within-individual prospective study of 50,000 patients with bipolar disorder. BACKGROUND: In vitro studies have demonstrated that lithium has antiviral properties, but evidence from human studies is scarce. Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer to treat patients with bipolar disorder. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between lithium use and the risk of respiratory infections in patients with bipolar disorder. To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithium's effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of valproate, which is an alternative to lithium used to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder., METHOD: We followed 51,509 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Swedish Patient register 2005-2013. We applied a within-individual design using stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of respiratory infections during treated periods compared with untreated periods., RESULTS: During follow-up, 5,760 respiratory infections were documented in the Swedish Patient Register. The incidence rate was 28% lower during lithium treatment (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) and 35% higher during valproate treatment (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.73) compared with periods off treatment., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world evidence that lithium is associated with decreased risk for respiratory infections and suggests that the repurposing potential of lithium for potential antiviral or antibacterial effects is worthy of investigation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19., SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively., MAIN RESULTS: We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the USA. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. Since there are 22 ongoing studies that plan to evaluate more than 15,000 participants in this setting, we will add more robust evidence to this review in future updates.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 and Aspergillus section Fumigati coinfection in an immunocompetent patient treated with corticosteroids. BACKGROUND: Patients with severe viral pneumonia are likely to receive high-dose immunomodulatory drugs to prevent clinical worsening. Aspergillus species have been described as frequent secondary pneumonia agents in severely ill influenza patients receiving steroids. COVID-19 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are receiving steroids as part of their treatment and they share clinical characteristics with other patients with severe viral pneumonias. COVID-19 patients receiving steroids should be considered a putative risk group of invasive aspergillosis., CASE REPORT: We are reporting a SARS-CoV-2/Aspergillus section Fumigati coinfection in an elderly intubated patient with a history of pulmonary embolism treated with corticosteroids. The diagnosis was made following the ad hoc definitions described for patients admitted to ICU with severe influenza, including clinical criteria (fever for 3 days refractory to the appropriate antibiotic therapy, dyspnea, pleural friction rub, worsening of respiratory status despite antibiotic therapy and need of ventilator support), a radiological criterion (pulmonary infiltrate) and a mycological criterion (several positive galactomannan tests on serum with ratio >=0.5). In addition, Aspergillus section Fumigati DNA was found in serum and blood samples. These tests were positive 4 weeks after the patient was admitted to the ICU. The patient received voriconazole and after two month in ICU his respiratory status improved; he was discharged after 6 weeks of antifungal treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Severely ill COVID-19 patients would be considered a new aspergillosis risk group. Galactomannan and Aspergillus DNA detection would be useful methods for Aspergillus infection diagnosis as they allow avoiding the biosafety issues related to these patients.

{"text": "The Inhaled Steroid Ciclesonide Blocks SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication by Targeting the Viral Replication-Transcription Complex in Cultured Cells. Here, we screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 mu M. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS and COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Palliative care in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: looking back, thinking ahead. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. However, it is difficult to diagnose and is unique in that it is both a genetic and transmissible disease. The disease is characterised by symptoms of a rapidly progressive dementia. Palliation is the only treatment and early diagnosis is an important aspect in relation to gaining speedy access to palliative and end-of-life care services. People with CJD may be cared for in a diversity of settings including; general hospital wards, neurological units, hospices; care homes and in their own home. Management of physical and psychosocial symptoms and dealing with family bereavement is complex and challenging. Due to the complexity of the physical symptoms input from clinicians with palliative care expertise is an important consideration. Given transmission risk and the latent incidence of infection in the general population, following the emergence of variant CJD; plus the recent hypothesis of a potential relationship between immune responses to COVID-19 and the acceleration of preclinical or evident neurodegenerative disease, there is a need for renewed interest in research in this field. Over the past 20 years, many thousands of articles have been published on CJD.

{"text": "Investigating and Improving the Accuracy of US Citizens' Beliefs about the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Survey Study. Background: The COVID-19 infodemic, a surge of information and misinformation, has sparked worry about the public's perception of the coronavirus pandemic. Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus. Objective(s): The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: The United States. Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve people's belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic. Method(s): We conducted a 4-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting on April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the United States had peaked. Each week, we measured participants' belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements: Two false and two true statements. Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus. Result(s): A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced regarding age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline (T0) wave survey. Retention rate for the follow-up waves-first follow-up wave (T1), second follow-up wave (T2), and final wave (T3)-was high (>=85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high for all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements; the belief accuracy scale ranged from-1, indicating completely inaccurate beliefs, to 1, indicating completely accurate beliefs (T0 mean 0.75, T1 mean 0.78, T2 mean 0.77, and T3 mean 0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (eg, social distancing) (r at all waves was between 0.26 and 0.29 and all P values were less than .001) and were associated with trust in scientists (ie, higher trust was associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (ie, liberal, Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative, Republican participants), and the primary news source (ie, participants reporting CNN or Fox News as the main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy. Conclusion(s): The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens' beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the public's susceptibility to misinformation.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

{"text": "Immunological biomarkers of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a global health emergency. The damage and threat posed by this virus to nearly every country in the world have far exceeded those of the other six previous coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) combined. A comprehensive profile of the hemato-logical and inflammatory biomarkers of COVID-19 is covered in this review. Significant hematological changes that have been reported in infected patients include the following biomarker candidates: lymphocyte counts (LYM), neutrophil counts (NO), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to CD8+ T-cell ratio (N8R), eosinophil counts (EO), platelet counts (PLT), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Likewise, significant changes in soluble mediators include interleukin (IL)-2r, IL-2r to lymphocyte ratio (ILR), IL-6, interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoat-tractant protein (MCP-3), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Multiplex biomarker analyses based on hematological and cytokine changes in combination with biomedical levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-terminal prohormone BNP (NT-proBNP), serum urea, C-reac-tive protein (CRP), and D-dimer have shown improved diagnostic accuracy for determining disease severity in patients compared with single biomarker analyses.

{"text": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Particles Using Direct, Reagent-Free Electrochemical Sensing. The development of new methods for direct viral detection using streamlined and ideally reagent-free assays is a timely and important, but challenging, problem. The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: Practices regarding anticoagulation use in coronavirus disease 2019 focus primarily on its efficacy in the critically ill without a clear understanding of when to begin anticoagulation. We sought to understand the association of preinfection daily oral anticoagulation use and the short-term mortality of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Retrospective chart review., Setting: Large health system with high coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence., Patients: Patients 60 years or older admitted to the hospital with positive coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction test., Interventions: We compared both those on warfarin and those on a direct oral anticoagulant prior to admission and throughout disease course with those who were never exposed to an oral anticoagulant., Results: Our primary outcome was inhospital mortality at 21 days from the first coronavirus disease 2019 test ordered. Patients in the direct oral anticoagulant group (n = 104) were found to have significantly lower 21-day all-cause in hospital mortality than patients in the control group (n = 894) both prior to adjustment (14.4% vs 23.8%; odds ratio, 0.57 [0.29-0.92]; p = 0.03) and after controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (odds ratio, 0.44 [0.20-0.90]; p = 0.033). Patients on warfarin (n = 28) were found to have an elevated unadjusted mortality rate of 32% versus 23.8% in the control group (odds ratio, 1.51 [0.64-3.31]; p = 0.31). After adjustment, a reduction in mortality was observed but not found to be statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.29 [0.02-1.62]; p = 0.24). There was no statistical difference noted in the number of bleeding events in each group., Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort study evaluating oral anticoagulant use among patients with coronavirus disease 2019, we found that patients who are on daily oral anticoagulation at the time of infection and throughout their disease course had significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality at 21 days. Validation of these findings should be performed on population-based levels. While research regarding anticoagulation algorithms is ongoing, we believe these results support future randomized control trials to understand the efficacy and risk of the use of early oral anticoagulation.

On this basis, the psychological studies of patients, medical staff and the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China were analyzed, and fear psychology was found to be prevalent among all kinds of people. Modern researches on \"Fear injury kidney\" have also found that long-term or excessive fear could cause changes in the neuro-endocrine-immune system, which can induce diseases or susceptibility to some diseases. Therefore, during or after the prevalence of COVID-19, different groups of people may have emotional reactions such as stress and fear, which should be paid long-term attention, and the influence of fear on the body cannot be ignored.

Such proteins may be pharmacological targets benefitting outcomes, or biomarkers of disease severity. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) performs a key role within the RAAS, cleaving angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 (ANG-2). ACE is prevalent in the pulmonary epithelium, and thus equally ANG-2. ANG-2 is a potent vasoconstrictor, and associated with inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress4. It has been implicated in COVID-19 disease severity, raised ANG-2 has been reported in cases of COVID-195 and in mice studies of ARDS is associated with severe lung injury6. While much literature focusses on the regulatory functions of ACE2 on ANG-2, we considered a potential role for measuring serum ACE to monitor disease severity. We hypothesised that unknown pathological mechanisms would modify serum ACE levels, given an increase in ANG-2. We were unclear whether this may be through a negative or positive feedback mechanism. Objective(s): To perform opportunistic isolated serum ACE levels on COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU), during a 1-month period, to determine whether it was objectively altered during the disease state. This pilot study would justify future, systematic investigation. Method(s): Within the analysis period we tested 28 patients admitted to our District General Hospital ICU, London. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection had been diagnosed by reversetranscriptase polymerase-chain-reaction for 26 patients and 2 with compelling radiographic evidence. Data on ACE-inhibitor use was not available, though it is likely no patient used them within 7 days of testing. Result(s): Of the patients tested, 26 had a normal serum ACE level (8-52 IU/L) representing 93% of the sample. One patient's level was objectively low ( < 5 IU/L), and another high (78 IU/L). The overall cohort mortality was 32%. Of note, both objectively abnormal patients died. Conclusion(s): ANG-2 is regulated in its production by ACE, and removal by ACE-2. Any increase in ANG-2 activity may be resultant from an excess of the former, and/or a deficiency in the latter. Given the largely normal serum ACE amongst the population, it further implicates a downregulation of ACE-2 in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19. Murine and in vitro studies of SARS-CoV-1 observed decreased ACE-2 expression following its interaction with the viral spike protein7, 8. ACE does not appear to be reliably modified during the COVID-19 disease process for use as a biomarker, or to justify future biochemical analysis; an important negative finding for ongoing investigations into the relevance of the RAAS pathway to COVID-19. Robust investigation of the changes to ANG-2 regulation, particularly relating to ACE-2, is required.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A comparative study of human betacoronavirus spike proteins: structure, function and therapeutics. Coronaviruses are the paradigm of emerging 21st century zoonotic viruses, triggering numerous outbreaks and a severe global health crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 51 million people across the globe as of 12 November 2020. The crown-like spikes on the surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The spike (S) protein adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the virus into the host. This multifunctional protein mediates the entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. This review article focuses on the structural and functional comparison of S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we review the current state of knowledge about receptor recognition, the membrane fusion mechanism, structural epitopes, and glycosylation sites of the S proteins of these viruses. We further discuss various vaccines and other therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and small molecules based on the S protein of these three viruses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background and Aim: This review investigates the role of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations in COVID-19, particularly with regard to the prevalence of isolated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Method(s): We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library for COVID-19 publications from 1 December 2019 to 18 May 2020. We included any study that reported the presence of GI symptoms in a sample of >5 COVID-19 patients. Data collection and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Where >=3 studies reported data sufficiently similar to allow calculation of a pooled prevalence, we performed random effects meta-analysis. Result(s): This review included 17 776 COVID-19 patients from 108 studies. Isolated GI symptoms only occurred in 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-6%) of patients. GI symptoms were reported in 20% (95% CI 15-24%) of patients. The most common were anorexia (21%, 95% CI 15-27%), diarrhea (13%, 95% CI 11-16%), nausea or vomiting (8%, 95% CI 6-11%), and abdominal pain (4%, 95% CI 2-6%). Transaminase elevations were present in 24% (95% CI 17-31%) of patients. Higher prevalence of GI symptoms were reported in studies published after 1st April, with prevalence of diarrhea 16% (95% CI 13-20), nausea or vomiting 12% (95% CI 8-16%), and any GI symptoms 24% (95% CI 18-34%). GI symptoms were associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.2), but not mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52-1.54). Conclusion(s): Patients with isolated GI symptoms may represent a small but significant portion of COVID-19 cases. When testing resources are abundant, clinicians should still consider testing patients with isolated GI symptoms or unexplained transaminase elevations for COVID-19. More recent studies estimate higher overall GI involvement in COVID-19 than was previously recognized.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "The natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection. Background. Little is known about the natural history of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection. Methods. We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine center for coronavirus disease 2019 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrollment and daily nasopharyngeal/throat swabs (NTSs) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results. Between 10 March and 4 April 2020, 14 000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13 (43%) never had symptoms and 17 (57%) were symptomatic. Seventeen (57%) participants imported cases. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS collected at enrollment (8/13 [62%] vs 17/17 [100%]; P = .02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20 of 27 (74%) available saliva samples (7 of 11 [64%] in the asymptomatic group and 13 of 16 [81%] in the symptomatic group; P = .56). Analysis of RT-PCR positivity probability showed that asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P < .001 for difference over the first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to 4 contacts. Conclusions. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTSs. The NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but these individuals appear able to transmit the virus to others.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has generated new hope and optimism that schools, colleges, and universities can return to in-person classroom instruction and teaching sometime in 2021. This paper summarizes the key factors affecting the personal health risks that teaching faculty face from returning to in-person classroom instruction and the steps that schools should take to prepare for fall 2021 re-opening. The rate of vaccination deployment and the rate of viral mutation are the key variables that will determine whether the USA will reach herd immunity before the fall 2021 term begins.

{"text": "Unbiased interrogation of memory B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients reveals a broad antiviral humoral response targeting SARS-CoV-2 antigens beyond the spike protein. Patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infections produce antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against multiple viral proteins. Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of V L and V H gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

For this reason, knowing the clinical findings and course of the disease is important for early diagnosis and treatment. In this article, COVID-19 cases followed up after quarantine were discussed. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the data of 99 patients who were followed up during travel and post-Umrah quarantine between 31 March and 15 April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Of the 99 patients included in the study, 66 (66.7%) were females, 33 (33.3%) were males, and mean age was 59.8 +/- 11.4 years. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was positive at the time of admission in 97 (98.0%) of the 99 patients. Thirty-nine (39.4%) of the patients were symptomatic and 25.3% of the patients had cough, 8.1% had fever, and 7.1% had shortness of breath. While SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test was negative in 2 (3.3%) of the 60 patients without complaints, 58 (96.7%) of them were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. Leukopenia was detected as 3%, lymphopenia 66.7%, D-dimer height 47.5%, LDH elevation 38.4%, CRP elevation 45.5%. Ground glass opacities were present in 81 (81.8%) of the patients with lung involvement, and consolidation areas were present in 40 patients (40.4%). Underlying disease was present in 38 (38.4%) of the patients. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common underlying diseases. It was observed that 89 (89.4%) of our cases had negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test on the 5th day. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 infection is an infectious disease that can present with many different clinics. In asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, lung involvement findings and disorders in laboratory parameters may be observed.

{"text": "Breathability and safety testing of personal protective equipment: \"human-comfort\" factor remains undefined. Healthcare systems all over the world have been enormously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers (HCWs) taking care of these patients need personal protective equipments (PPEs) standardized for full protection from droplets and aerosols carrying viral load to variable distances. There has been a surge of manufacturers supplying these protective gears in India and regulatory agencies have issued technical specifications pertaining to PPEs focusing solely on synthetic blood penetration tests (SBPTs) and keeping the upper limit of non-woven fabric to 95 g/m2 (GSM). These PPE specifications are silent on air permeability (AP) and water/moisture vapor transmission rate (WVTR/ MVTR) of the fabric. As a result, most of the PPE kits, despite having appropriate SBPT certifications from regulatory agencies, have extremely poor permeability and breathability. The acceptability of PPEs by HCWs can be vastly improved when the end-users are proactively invited to participate in \"comfort testing\" of PPEs before getting issuance of certification for marketing. \"Field testing\" or \"end-user trials\" in which HCWs don the PPE and assess it for comfort while performing different types of clinical work, e.g., in intensive care units (ICUs), operation theaters, cath labs, etc., also takes into account a hitherto often ignored \"human-comfort-factor\" that not only enhances the understanding of HCWs about the need for the PPEs but can also motivate them to use it without worrying about discomfort. We hereby propose that comfort fit testing (COmfort and Material Fit is an Obviously Required Test) should be a part of the mandatory testing and certification process for PPE, so that the industry invests wisely in manufacturing PPE kits that are not only certified for fabric but are also tested for comfort factors.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: To examine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among the general population across 10 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study which used convenience sampling and collected data by conducting an online survey. Participants were sourced from 10 Eastern and Western countries. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure the outcome variable of suicidal ideation. Ordinal regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: A total of 25,053 participants (22.7% male) were recruited. Results from the analysis showed that the UK and Brazil had the lowest odds of suicidal ideation compared to Macau (p < 0.05). Furthermore, younger age, male, married, and differences in health beliefs were significantly associated with suicidal ideation (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for joint international collaboration to formulate effective suicide prevention strategies in a timely manner and the need to implement online mental health promotion platforms.

{"text": "Methylene Blue Inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction-a Mechanism that can Contribute to its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19. Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 muM) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC50 (3.5 muM). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.

OBJECTIVE: To better define the clinical distinctions between the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related paediatric inflammatory multi-system syndrome (PIMS) and Kawasaki disease (kDa)., METHODS: We compared three groups of patients: group 1, cases from our national historic kDa database (kDa-HIS); group 2, patients with kDa admitted to an intensive care unit (kDa-ICU) from both our original cohort and the literature; and group 3, patients with PIMS from the literature., RESULTS: kDa-HIS included 425 patients (male to female ratio 1.3, mean age 2.8 +/- 2.4 years), kDa-ICU 176 (male to female ratio 1.3, mean age 3.5 +/- 3.1 years), and PIMS 404 (male to female ratio 1.4, mean age 8.8 +/- 3.7 years). As compared with kDa-HIS patients, kDa-ICU and PIMS patients had a higher proportion of cardiac failure and digestive and neurological signs. They also had lower frequency of typical mucocutaneous signs, lower platelet count, higher C-reactive protein level, and lower sodium level. As compared with kDa-HIS and kDa-ICU patients, PIMS patients were older and more frequently had myocarditis. They had fewer coronary abnormalities and lower sodium level. Unresponsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulins was more frequent in kDa-ICU than kDa-HIS and PIMS patients., CONCLUSION: On clinical grounds, regular kDa, kDa-ICU and PIMS might belong to a common spectrum of non-specific pathogen-triggered hyperinflammatory states.

{"text": "Interleukin 1alpha: a comprehensive review on the role of IL-1alpha in the pathogenesis and targeted treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-1alpha is a ubiquitous and pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine. The IL-1alpha precursor is constitutively present in nearly all cell types in health, but is released upon necrotic cell death as a bioactive mediator. IL-1alpha is also expressed by infiltrating myeloid cells within injured tissues. The cytokine binds the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), as does IL-1beta, and induces the same pro-inflammatory effects. Being a bioactive precursor released upon tissue damage and necrotic cell death, IL-1alpha is central to the pathogenesis of numerous conditions characterized by organ or tissue inflammation. These include conditions affecting the lung and respiratory tract, dermatoses and inflammatory skin disorders, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, inflammatory thrombosis, as well as complex multifactorial conditions such as COVID-19, vasculitis and Kawasaki disease, Behcet's syndrome, Sjogren Syndrome, as well as cancer. This review illustrates the clinical relevance of IL-1alpha to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as the rationale for the targeted inhibition of this cytokine for treatment of these conditions. Three biologics are available to reduce the activities of IL-1alpha; the monoclonal antibody bermekimab, the IL-1 soluble receptor rilonacept, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ. The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease. On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles. The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes. The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community. CASE REPORT We report on a COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state in a 65-year-old man with no history of comorbid illness. Initially, he presented with right-sided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block. The patient's elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction (MI). His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19-associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature. But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented. The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes.

{"text": "Generation and Characterization of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated public health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter expressing viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Henceforth, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large libraries of compounds and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput screening settings, to identify those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.

{"text": "The European Academy of Neurology COVID-19 registry (ENERGY): an international instrument for surveillance of neurological complications in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health issue. Neurological complications have been reported in up to one-third of affected cases, but their distribution varies significantly in terms of prevalence, incidence and phenotypical characteristics. Variability can be mostly explained by the differing sources of cases (hospital vs. community-based), the accuracy of the diagnostic approach and the interpretation of the patients' complaints. Moreover, after recovering, patients can still experience neurological symptoms. To obtain a more precise picture of the neurological manifestations and outcome of the COVID-19 infection, an international registry (ENERGY) has been created by the European Academy of Neurology in collaboration with European national neurological societies and the Neurocritical Care Society and Research Network. ENERGY can be implemented as a stand-alone instrument for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and neurological findings or as an addendum to an existing registry not targeting neurological symptoms. Data are also collected to study the impact of neurological symptoms and neurological complications on outcomes. The variables included in the registry have been selected in the interests of most countries, to favour pooling with data from other sources and to facilitate data collection even in resource-poor countries. Included are adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, ascertained through neurological consultation, and providing informed consent. Key demographic and clinical findings are collected at registration. Patients are followed up to 12 months in search of incident neurological manifestations. As of 19 August, 254 centres from 69 countries and four continents have made requests to join the study.Copyright \u00a9 2020 European Academy of Neurology", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has often been perceived as a predominantly respiratory condition, it is characterized by complications in multiple organ systems. Especially the involvement of the cardiovascular system, along with the possibly severe pulmonary injury, is crucial for prognosis. We identified three COVID-19 patients with takotsubo (TT) cardiomyopathy at our infectious diseases treatment center and present their clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and angiographic features. All patients were female (median age, 67 years); disease severity regarding COVID-19 ranged from asymptomatic to ARDS (adult respiratory syndrome) necessitating mechanical ventilation for 22 days. Angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in patient 1, severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) in patient 2, and insignificant bystander CAD in patient 3. All patients showed classic apical hypokinesia with basal hyperkinesia. In patient 3, TT cardiomyopathy resulted in transient cardiogenic shock. Twenty-eight-day mortality was 0% in this case series. In conclusion, takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be yet another clinical entity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or so-called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has been implicated in cases of mild to severe diseases of the respiratory system. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that SARS-CoV-2 infection is a pandemic infection. Objective(s): Our study aimed at the detection of the relationship of some hematological and biochemical markers with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kirkuk City/Iraq. Method(s): A cross-sectional study performed at Kirkuk general hospital (May 15 to, August 25 /2020). It was done on a total of (84) patients (50 male and 34 female), who were aging between (16-70) years old. They already diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection through having chest computerized tomography scan (CT-Scan) from (Simens Co.), and 60 noninfected with SARS-CoV-2, who used as a control group at similar age group. Blood samples taken from the patients and control group to test for; serum ferritin, D-dimer, blood urea, serum creatinine, lymphocytes and total white blood cells count. Result(s): The study revealed the highest rate (72%, and 42 %) of decreased white blood cells (WBCs) in male and female patients respectively; this was also true for the lymphocytes count where the patients showed the highest rate of decreased lymphocytes count. The majority of the patients showed increased levels of serum ferritin, D-dimer, blood urea, and serum creatinine. Most of the patients were from blood group A. Conclusion(s): Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may decrease the levels of WBCs and lymphocytes, while having reverse impact on the serum ferritin, Ddimer, blood urea and serum creatinine levels which increases them.

{"text": "Association of Social and Economic Inequality With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties. Importance: It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population., Objective: To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association., Exposures: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed., Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates., Results: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19-related deaths per 100000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918)., Conclusions and Relevance: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Hyperreflective lesions at the level of ganglion cell (GCL) and inner plexiform retinal layers (IPL) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cotton wool spots in the examination of the eye fundus have recently been described as findings in patients with COVID-19 infection., CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old healthy Caucasian male anesthetist who had treated COVID-19 patients during the previous 5 weeks and suddenly presented with a temporal relative scotoma in his left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 for the left eye, and no discromatopsy or afferent pupillary defect was present. Visual field test was performed, with no significant findings associated with the focal loss of sensitivity described by the patient. The anterior segment was unremarkable on slit lamp examination in both eyes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed no significant findings. A placoid, hyperreflective band at the level of the GCL and IPL was visible in OCT which spared the outer retina, at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later. An oropharyngeal swab test was performed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination.

Introduction Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has been widely spreading through the world and has become a global pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, However, an increase in the number of the children with SARS-CoV-2 presented with a significant systemic inflammatory response similar to Kawasaki syndrome, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), supporting the idea that COVID-19 is a triggering factor. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from October 2019 to 30 June 2020, by using the terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus, Kawasaki, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, cytokine storm and myocarditis in several electronic databases and Government Agencies Websites (PubMed, Google Scholar, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO and UK Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health). Retrospective observational studies, case series, and case report studies about the main clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatment, and patients' responses were included. Conclusions MIS-C leads to serious life-threatening conditions in children and adolescence, including toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and cardiac involvement. This paper aimed to bring this subset of children to the attention of clinicians to optimize early recognition and management of this syndrome during the pandemic. We summarized the main clinical pictures, defined laboratory findings, and illustrated the optimal treatment of children with MIS-C related to SARS-CoV-2 to help clinicians to reduce mortality and morbidity of the diseaseCopyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "COVID-19: Discovery, diagnostics and drug development. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started as an epidemic in Wuhan in 2019, and has since become a pandemic. Groups from China identified and sequenced the virus responsible for COVID-19, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and determined that it was a novel coronavirus sharing high sequence identity with bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, suggesting a zoonotic origin. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of vertebrates. The rapid release of the sequence of the virus has enabled the development of diagnostic tools. Additionally, serological tests can now identify individuals who have been infected. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a fatality rate of around 1-3%, which is commonly linked to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely resulting from uncontrolled immune activation, the so called \"cytokine storm\". Risk factors for mortality include advanced age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Drug repurposing has been used to rapidly identify potential treatments for COVID-19, which could move quickly to phase III. Better knowledge of the virus and its enzymes will aid the development of more potent and specific directacting antivirals. In the long term, a vaccine to prevent infection is crucial; however, even if successful, it might not be available before 2021-22. To date, except for intravenous remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have modest effects in moderate to severe COVID-19, no strong clinical evidence supports the efficacy of any other drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to provide insights on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, its virology, diagnostic tools, and the ongoing drug discovery effort.

{"text": "How can we interpret SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results?. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world has raced to understand and accurately diagnose infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Today, hundreds of commercial antibody tests are on the market despite often lacking proper validation and with unsatisfactory sensitivity and/or specificity. In addition, many questions related to the humoral response remain unresolved, although research is carried out at an unprecedented speed. Despite the shortcomings, serological assays have an important part to play in combating the pandemic by aiding in diagnosis and sero-epidemiological studies. However, careful attention must be paid to the application of serology and the interpretation of serological data-especially in low prevalence regions, both at an individual and at a population level. In this article, we argue that serological results are often misinterpreted, and in the eagerness to be first, methodological rigor is often taking a backseat. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

{"text": "Kidney injury molecule-1 is a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients present high incidence of kidney abnormalities, which are associated with poor prognosis and mortality. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, whether there is a specific target of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney remains unclear. Herein, by using in silico simulation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling, and rational design of antagonist peptides, we demonstrate that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), a molecule dramatically upregulated upon kidney injury, binds with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its attachment to cell membrane, with the immunoglobulin variable Ig-like (Ig V) domain of KIM1 playing a key role in this recognition. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and KIM1 is potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide AP2. In addition, our results also suggest interactions between KIM1 Ig V domain and the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pathogens of two severe infectious respiratory diseases. Together, these findings suggest KIM1 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. We propose that KIM1 may thus mediate and exacerbate the renal infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a 'vicious cycle', and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.

It has been proposed that a subset of mild or asymptomatic cases with undetectable antibodies may clear the virus in a T-cell cytotoxic-dependent manner, albeit recent data revealed the importance of B-cells in that regard. We hypothesized that underdiagnosed antigenemia/viremia may conceal humoral response possibly through immunocomplex formation. We report the first case of late-onset seroconversion detected following decline in antigenemia/viremia levels.

{"text": "The evolutionary making of SARS-CoV-2. Covid-19 is the most devastating pandemic of the past 100 years. A zoonotic transfer presumably at a wildlife market introduced the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (sarbecovirus; beta-coronavirus), to humans in late 2019. Meanwhile, the mechanistic details of the infection process have been largely elucidated, and structural models explain binding of the virial spike to the human cell surface receptor ACE2. Yet, the evolutionary trajectory that gave rise to this pathogen is poorly understood. Here we scan SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences in-silico for innovations along the evolutionary lineage starting with the last common ancestor of coronaviruses. Substantial differences in the sets of proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 and viruses outside sarbecovirus, and in their domain architectures, indicate divergent functional demands. By contrast, sarbecoviruses themselves are almost fully conserved at these levels of resolution. However, profiling spike evolution on the sub-domain level using predicted linear epitopes reveals that this protein was gradually reshaped within sarbecovirus. The only epitope that is private to SARS-CoV-2 overlaps with the furin cleavage site. This lends phylogenetic support to the hypothesis that a change in strategy facilitated the zoonotic transfer of SARS-CoV-2 and its success as a human pathogen. Upon furin cleavage, spike switches from a \u201cstealth mode\u201d where immunodominant ACE2 binding epitopes are largely hidden to an \u201cattack mode\u201d where these epitopes are exposed. The resulting reinforcement of ACE2 binding extends the window of opportunity for cell entry. SARS-CoV-2 variants fine-tuning this mode switch will be particularly threatening as they optimize immune evasion.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the highest-yield sample for diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs., METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval October 1st, 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types [saliva, oropharyngeal (OP), and nasal (NS) swabs] versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in sub-groups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias., RESULTS: From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives [NS (82%, 95% CI: 73-90%), OP (84%, 95% CI: 57-100%), saliva (88%, 95% CI: 81 - 93%)] than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (97%, 95% CI: 90-100%). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield., CONCLUSIONS: NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric vs. adult, late vs. early in disease course) and head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.

The COVID-19 pandemic and government imposed social restrictions like lockdown exposed most individuals to an unprecedented stress, increasing mental health disorders worldwide. We explored subjective cognitive functioning and mental health changes and their possible interplay related to COVID-19-lockdown. We also investigated potential risk factors to identify more vulnerable groups. Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Immunological methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans are important to track COVID-19 cases and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infections and immunization to future vaccines. The aim of this work was to develop a simple chromogenic magnetic bead-based immunoassay which allows rapid, inexpensive, and quantitative detection of human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum, plasma, or blood. Recombinant 6xHis-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein was mobilized on the surface of Ni2+ magnetic beads and challenged with serum or blood samples obtained from controls or COVID-19 cases. The beads were washed, incubated with anti-human IgG-HPR conjugate, and immersed into a solution containing a chromogenic HPR substrate. Bead transfer and homogenization between solutions was aided by a simple low-cost device. The method was validated by two independent laboratories, and the performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans was in the same range as obtained using the gold standard immunoassays ELISA and Luminex, though requiring only a fraction of consumables, instrumentation, time to deliver results, and volume of sample. Furthermore, the results obtained with the method described can be visually interpreted without compromising accuracy as demonstrated by validation at a point-of-care unit.

The cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (Genscript) is the first such commercially available assay, detecting antibodies that block RBD/ACE-2 interaction. We aimed to evaluate cPass to inform its use and assess its added value compared to anti-RBD ELISA assays. <h4>Methods</h4> Serum reference panels were used to compare cPass to plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and a pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies. We assessed the correlation of cPass with an ELISA detecting anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies at a single timepoint and across intervals from onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <h4>Results</h4> Compared to PRNT-50%, cPass had 100% sensitivity (95%CI 82-100) and 95% specificity (76-100). Sensitivity was also very high compared to the pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assay, but specificity was lower, ranging from 17-70%. Highest agreement between cPass and ELISA was for anti-RBD IgG ( r =0.851 at 0-6 weeks; r =0.798 at > 6 weeks). Anti-RBD IgG diagnostic accuracy for detection of neutralizing antibodies was essentially identical to that of cPass. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The added value of cPass compared to an IgG anti-RBD ELISA was not supported by these results.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 over the preclinical, clinical, and postclinical period. Background: It is necessary to know the viral kinetics and conduct epidemiological investigations of confirmers to prevent the spread of the new infectious disease COVID-19 to the community. To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2. Method(s): A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiological link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Result(s): COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development, which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0-5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was the lowest in the clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred (Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. Conclusion(s): Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. As there is a very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was detected with all subjects in the normal mucosa of the keratinized stratified squamous epithelia of the tongue and non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelia of the lip and cheek. It was found that ACE2 is expressed in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane mainly in the stratum granulosum of the epithelia while the TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed on the cell membrane mainly in the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum, but not in the stratum basale. Antibodies' reactions for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not observed in the nuclei or keratin layer. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the oral epithelia appears to be general, and the expression was also observed in the mucous and serous acini of the labial glands. The SARS-CoV-2 may transiently attach to the oral mucosa and the minor salivary glands which are present under all of the oral mucosa. The oral cavity can be considered an important organ for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and may provide a preventive medical avenue to guard against COVID-19 by preventing saliva from scattering.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

{"text": "Early postoperative outcomes among patients with delayed surgeries after preoperative positive test for SARS-CoV-2: A case-control study from a single institution. Background: There are limited data on surgical complications for patients that have delayed surgery after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to analyze the surgical outcomes of patients submitted to surgery after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method(s): Asymptomatic patients that had surgery delayed after preoperative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were matched in a 1:2 ratio for age, type of surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists to patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Result(s): About 1253 patients underwent surgical procedures and were subjected to screening for SARS-CoV-2. Forty-nine cases with a delayed surgery were included in the coronavirus disease (COVID) recovery (COVID-rec) group and were matched to 98 patients included in the COVID negative (COVID-neg) group. Overall, 22 (15%) patients had 30-days postoperative complications, but there was no statistically difference between groups -16.3% for COVID-rec and 14.3% for COVID-neg, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 1.17:95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-3.0; p =.74). Moreover, we did not find difference regarding grades more than or equal to 3 complication rates - 8.2% for COVID-rec and 6.1% for COVID-neg (OR 1.36:95%CI 0.36-5.0; p =.64). There were no pulmonary complications or SARS-CoV-2 related infection and no deaths within the 30-days after surgery. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that patients with delayed elective surgeries due to asymptomatic preoperative positive SARS-CoV-2 test are not at higher risk of postoperative complications.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19 Infection Among US Dialysis Patients: Risk Factors and Outcomes From a National Dialysis Provider. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients receiving maintenance dialysis are a highly vulnerable population due to their comorbidities and circumstances that limit physical distancing during treatment. This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics with at least one patient with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from February to June 2020, treated by a mid-size national dialysis provider., PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregate setting, comorbid conditions, measures of frailty, and use of selected medications., OUTCOMES: COVID-19 defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19., ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19., RESULTS: 438/7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs. home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 was 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregate setting [OR = 17.10 (95% CI 13.51, 21.54)]. Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died.

{"text": "Mental resilience to stressor prevalence and severity during the Corona lockdown in Europe. Background: The rising prevalence of stress-related mental and physical disorders over the past decades, and more recently in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the need for a better understanding of stress-protective factors (resilience factors). Resilience has been conceptualised as the maintenance or quick recovery of mental health following exposure to adversity. By studying psycho-social factors that influence resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was possible to examine population-wide responses to stressors of unusually similar nature. Method(s): In a first interim analysis of an international resilience study we examined data from 5000 European adults collected during the first phases of pandemic-related movement and contact restrictions ('lockdown'). Linear regression, regularised regression, and mediation analyses were employed to compare the influence of nine potential resilience factors according to preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn). Result(s): All hypothesized resilience factors were significantly associated with resilience as an outcome. Compared to other resilience factors, positive appraisal of the COVID-19 pandemic showed the strongest effect. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that general positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience, and further revealed that PAS mediates the positive influence of perceived social support on resilience. Discussion(s): The investigated resilience factors provide promising targets for health interventions that aim to improve stress resilience in general or in the face of prolonged pandemic-related adversity. To improve intervention planning, future research should also investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on resilience factor use and efficacy, as well as the dynamics of time-variant resilience development in response to stressors exposure.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency and critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation in about 70% [1]. For SARS-CoV-2, preliminary data support the emergence of fungal infections in the context of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) [2]. In severe pulmonary infections due to influenza virus, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) occurs frequently among patients admitted to intensive care units and is associated with poor outcome. Objective(s): In this retrospective analysis, we evaluate the co-occurence of Aspergillus spp. in patients suffering from COVID-19 with respiratory insufficiency. Patients & Methods: Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples (BAL) from ventilated patients in an intensive care unit in a tertiary care hospital will be collected. Besides culture of BAL, measurement of Aspergillus galactomannan (Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories)) will be performed as well as Realtime PCR AsperGenius (PathoNostics) to verify Aspergillus spp.-DNA. In sera, both, (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan (Fungitell, Associates of Cape Cod) and Aspergillus galactomannan will be detected. Result(s): So far, 12 patients have been examined. Mean age is 61 years, all are of male gender. For one patient, positive glucan and PCR were confirmed by culture of Aspergillus fumigatus but Aspergillus galactomannan from serum and respiratory sample remained negative.

The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID-19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 A interacting distance from the ACE-2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three-dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed.

Background: Since the beginning of 2020, the Corona Virus Disease has broken out globally. This public health incident has had a great impact on the work and life of the public. Aim(s): Based on the event system theory, this article explored the influence of the \"COVID-19\" event on emotional exhaustion and deviant workplace behaviors. Method(s): This survey's objects are employees working in Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei affected by the epidemic. Using the questionnaire star, the online platform of the Marketing Research Office of Peking University and \"snowball\" methods 700 questionnaires were collected. Result(s): The response rate was 89.71% (n = 700). Female employees are more sensitive to the perceived event strength of the novel coronavirus pneumonia than male employees (F = 10.94, p <0.001); Employees aged 30-40 affected by the epidemic have the highest level of emotional exhaustion (F = 5.22, p < 0.01); A higher education level leads to a higher level of emotional exhaustion (F = 4.74, p < 0.01); The emotional exhaustion is polarized with the annual family income (F = 4.099, p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): The novelty, disruption, criticality of the Corona Virus Disease event has had a positive impact on the emotional exhaustion of employees in the workplace; Emotional exhaustion plays a partly mediating role between event strength with constructive deviant behaviors, and destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a positive effect on creative constructive deviant behaviors, challenging constructive deviant behaviors, and interpersonal destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a negative impact on organizational destructive deviant behaviors, and has no significant impact on interpersonal constructive deviant behaviors.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

OBJECTIVES: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with an extensive pneumonitis and frequent coagulopathy. We sought the true prevalence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 on the ICU, with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation., DESIGN: We undertook a single-center, retrospective analysis of 72 critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to ICU. CT angiography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were performed at admission as per routine institution protocols, with further imaging as clinically indicated. The prevalence of thrombotic complications and the relationship with coagulation parameters, other biomarkers, and survival were evaluated., SETTING: Coronavirus disease 2019 ICUs at a specialist cardiorespiratory center., PATIENTS: Seventy-two consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU during the study period (March 19, 2020, to June 23, 2020)., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All but one patient received thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation. Among 72 patients (male:female = 74%; mean age: 52 +/- 10; 35 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), there were 54 thrombotic complications in 42 patients (58%), comprising 34 pulmonary arterial (47%), 15 peripheral venous (21%), and five (7%) systemic arterial thromboses/end-organ embolic complications. In those with pulmonary arterial thromboses, 93% were identified incidentally on first screening CT with only 7% suspected clinically. Biomarkers of coagulation (e.g., D-dimer, fibrinogen level, and activated partial thromboplastin time) or inflammation (WBC count, C-reactive protein) did not discriminate between patients with or without thrombotic complications. Fifty-one patients (76%) survived to discharge; 17 (24%) patients died. Mortality was significantly greater in patients with detectable thrombus (33% vs 10%; p = 0.022)., CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary, among coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICU, despite anticoagulation. Detection of thrombus was usually incidental, not predicted by coagulation or inflammatory biomarkers, and associated with increased risk of death.

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) binds to angiotensin-converting enyzme 2 (ACE2) and enters the host cell. ACE2 protein is expressed highly in the testis., AIM: The aim of this study was to compare male reproductive hormones such as total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulant hormone (FSH), and prolactin between patients with COVID-19, age-matched cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection, and age-matched controls., METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study and included 262 men aged between 20 and 65 years. The study comprised 3 groups including patients with COVID-19 (n = 89), cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection (n = 30), and age-matched controls (n = 143). All cases were evaluated using TT, LH, FSH, and prolactin. Correlations between TT and clinical parameters of patient groups were investigated using Pearson's correlation test., OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the study was detection of the difference of TT, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels between the groups. Secondary outcome was to correlate TT and hospitalization time and oxygen saturation on hospital admission (SpO2) of patients., RESULTS: The mean age of study groups was 49.9 +/- 12.5 years, 52.7 +/- 9.6 years, and 50 +/- 7.8 years, respectively (P = .06). Serum TT levels was median 185.52 ng/dL in patients with COVID-19, median 288.67 ng/dL in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection and median 332 ng/dL in control cases, (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with testosterone deficiency in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 74.2%, 53.3%, and 37.8%, respectively (P < .0001). Serum LH levels (P = 0.0003) and serum prolactin levels (P = .0007) were higher in patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection than control cases. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlation between serum TT levels and hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19 (r = -0.45, P < .0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between SpO2 and serum TT levels in patients with COVID-19 ( r = 0.32, P = .0028)., CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physicians may consider to evaluate male patients with COVID-19 for concomitant androgen deficiency., STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include the evidence about the alteration of male reproductive hormones under COVID-19. Limitations include the analysis limited to one general hospital, only a single measurement of TT was available, free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not evaluated., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates COVID-19 is associated with decreased level of TT and increased level of LH and prolactin.

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. Study design: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. Result(s): 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection.

{"text": "Adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits neutralizing antibodies and CD4 T cell responses after a single immunization in mice. Background: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, infecting millions of people. A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed and remains a global health priority. Subunit vaccines are used successfully against other viruses when administered in the presence of an effective adjuvant. Method(s): We evaluated three different clinically tested adjuvant systems in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized (S-2P) spike protein using a one-dose regimen in mice. Finding(s): Whilst spike protein alone was only weakly immunogenic, the addition of either Aluminum hydroxide, a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion system (SE) or a cationic liposome-based adjuvant significantly enhanced antibody responses against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Kinetics of antibody responses differed, with SE providing the most rapid response. Neutralizing antibodies developed after a single immunization in all adjuvanted groups with ID50 titers ranging from 86-4063. Spike-specific CD4 T helper responses were also elicited, comprising mainly of IFN-gamma and IL-17 producing cells in the cationic liposome adjuvanted group, and more IL-5- and IL-10-secreting cells in the AH group. Interpretation(s): These results demonstrate that adjuvanted spike protein subunit vaccine is a viable strategy for rapidly eliciting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and CD4 T cell responses of various qualities depending on the adjuvant used, which can be explored in further vaccine development against COVID-19.

Background: Misinformation about COVID-19 is common and has been spreading rapidly across the globe through social media platforms and other information systems. Understanding what the public knows about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based on misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure efforts to reduce viral transmission are not undermined. Objective(s): This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation in Australia and their changes over time. Method(s): This prospective, longitudinal national survey was completed by adults (18 years and above) across April (n=4362), May (n=1882), and June (n=1369) 2020. Result(s): Stronger agreement with misinformation was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education level, and language other than English spoken at home (P<.01 for all). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (P<.001) with lower levels of digital health literacy, perceived threat of COVID-19, confidence in government, and trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with male gender and younger age), causation (associated with lower education level and greater social disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with stronger agreement with COVID-19 misinformation.

{"text": "COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)-when to transfuse. Background/Case Studies: CCP is a new product emergently approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19 based on clinical indications. The rationale is that CCP provides anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodiesimproving the recipient's immune response. Ideally, transfusion decisions should be based on the clinical status in conjunction with the patient's blood component level requiring supplementation. Thus, we measured the antibody levels of the donors and recipients. Study Design/Methods: Between 4/16 and 5/9/2020, 18 CCPs were transfused based on clinical indication. CCP was purchased from a regional blood product provider. Qualitative determination of anti-Spike protein IgG was performed in the recipient's pretransfusion plasma and in the CCP using the EuroImmun ELISA (Luebeck, Germany) for 16 of the patients. Results/Findings: Of the 16 patients, 11 were positive for IgG prior to the transfusion, questioning the utility of CCP administration. Patients 1-7, 10 and 11 are deceased. All other patients have been discharged. All patients receiving CCP were critically ill and on ventilation support, although the disease progressed at different paces. The patients who died showed a more rapid decline during the disease, thus there were a higher number of seronegative patients amongst those who died (3/7 of expired vs. 2/9 of living patients). There was no statistically significant difference between the surviving versus the deceased group regarding the time from admission to CCP transfusion but there was a statistically significant difference related to the total length of stay (mean of 39 surviving vs. 10 days expired group). Overall survival in our cohort was 50%. Two patients developed fever and hypotension during transfusion, raising the question of a transfusion reaction. Conclusion(s): Developing transfusion guidelines will help manage utilization and may reduce the risk to the patients and optimize outcomes. Based on these limited observations and the unknown therapeutic effect of the CCP, we propose to restrict CCP to IgG negative patients considering that the presence of IgG in the recipient indicates an active immune response, especially since the amount of IgG provided by the CCP is minimal compared to the total amount of patient IgG due to the high difference in volume between the CCP (200 ml) and the patient's plasma volume (3000 ml or more). The IgG detection is qualitative. The inhibitory capacity of the IgG was not assessed, although it is recognized that the anti-Spike protein antibodies have neutralization capacity. In our cohort rapid clinical decline within 5-6 days of symptom onset was associated with seronegativity.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

It is unclear whether real world neutralising antibody titres will follow those in clinical trials, particularly in elderly persons, and how this will be impacted by mutations in strains such as B1.1.7. Here we tested immune responses in patients 3 weeks following the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2. We also tested neutralising antibody responses against pseudoviruses expressing wild type Spike proteins or expressing 3 key mutations present in B.1.1.7 (deletion 69/70, N501Y, A570D). IgG Spike antibody titres correlated well with neutralisation. We observed a range of neutralisation titres against wild type, with geometric mean titre (GMT) of 24. The vaccine sera exhibited a range of inhibitory dilutions giving 50% neutralisation (ID50) from <1:4 to 3449. However a lower proportion of participants over 80 years old achieved threshold neutralisation titre of >1:4 for 50% neutralisation as compared to those under 80 years old (8/15 versus 8/8 P=0.052) after the first dose. Neutralisation titres were not significantly impacted by the combination of three Spike mutations tested, but were reduced against the full set of Spike mutations present in the B.1.1.7 variant. The highest fold change was approxiamately 6 and the median fold change for the B.1.1.7 variant versus wild type was 3.85 (IQR 2.68-5.28). Further work is needed to establish the impact of these observations on real life vaccine efficacy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Virtual Screening of Potential AEC2 Inhibitors for COVID-19 from Traditional Chinese Medicine. <h4>Background: </h4> : Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor, plays an important role in viral genome replication and immune response. ACE2 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) could be considered as a promising complementary therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19. However, the active components and action mechanisms that account for its therapeutic effects remain controversial. <h4>Methods: </h4> ACE2 was employed as a target related to COVID-19 to explore the active ingredients from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database. And the PharmMapper database and TCMSP database were used to predict the targets of the compounds. Moreover, the potential therapeutic targets of COVID-19 were acquired by intersection among genes differentially expressed in COVID-19 patients, genes screened from five public databases and genes targeted by active compounds. Finally, molecular docking verification and function analysis were performed. <h4>Result: </h4> s: In this study, puerarin, the common active compound for targeting ACE2 across the five TCMs ( Radix Cyathulae, Flos Puerariac, Radix Bupleuri, Radix Puerariac and Radix Hemerocallis ), was found. Due to the comprehensive analysis, we revealed that puerarin might prevent the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by blocking ACE2, chiefly modulated the T cell immunity and regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine response by affecting TNF, STAT1 and RNASE3. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> Taken together, the present study found that puerarin might have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19 through regulation of the immune system, inhibition of inflammation and prevention of virus entry into cells.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The dynamics underlying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection remains poorly understood. We added to the registered case reports of reinfection in USA, Belgium/Netherlands, Ecuador and Hong Kong, a small cluster of individuals with two episodes of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Virus genomic analysis and the host immune response were used to characterize this group. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Four individuals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with clinical manifestations of COVID-19 on March and again in late May of 2020 were studied. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for RT-PCR and viral genome sequencing (BGI-MGI-2000). Plasma samples from the acute and convalescent phases of both infection episodes were accessed to document innate and humoral responses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: After approximately 60 days of the first diagnostic episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the four individuals presented new clinical and molecular evidence of COVID-19. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence provided genetic evidence of reinfection. The individuals presented an enhanced innate response compared to healthy SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Patients did not develop a neutralizing humoral immunity, possibly remaining susceptible to another episode of COVID-19. The second episode, associated with higher viral loads and clinical symptoms, likely boosted their anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was fully documented by identification of genetically distinct virus sequences in the first and second episodes for two individuals. The quantity of SARS-CoV-2-associated genetic reads and coverage of virus genome ruled out that the initial RT-PCR results were false positive.

{"text": "[Sorting and detection of COVID-19 by low-dose thoracic CT scan in patients consulting the radiology department of Fann hospital (Dakar-Senegal)]. Introduction: COVID-19 has spread rapidly since its emergence in China and is currently a global health issue. Its definitive diagnosis is made by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. However, this diagnostic test has low sensitivity with delayed results. Hence, thoracic computed tomography represents an interesting alternative. The aims of this study were to assess the frequency of computed tomography (CT) lesions suggestive of COVID-19 and to compare the results of CT and PCR test., Methods: a prospective study carried out over15 working days and involved 47 patients. These patients were recruited based on the presence of at least 2 clinical signs of COVID-19. Chest CT without contrast according to the \"LOW-DOSE\" protocol was performed. A PCR test on nasopharyngeal swabs was done in patients with signs suggestive of COVID on CT. A serological test was performed in case of a discrepancy between the CT and PCR results., Results: thoracic CT was abnormal in 38 patients and normal in 9 patients. Lesions suggestive of COVID-19 have been identified in 32 patients. Two patients had lesions of non-specific pneumonia. Tuberculosis lesions were visualized in 3 patients. One patient had lesions of interstitial pneumonia. The mean DLP was 59 mGy.cm with extremes of 25 and 95 mGy.cm. Ground-glass opacity was present in 100% of COVID-19 suspects on CT. The results of the PCR test were the same than CT in 12 patients. The positive predictive value for CT was 37.5%. In 20 patients with COVID lesions on CT, the PCR test was negative with a false positive rate of 62.5%. In the patients with negative PCR test, 4 had a serological test for COVID-19 and this test was positive in 3., Conclusion: low-dose chest CT can reduce radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients who are at risk of cumulative dose due to repetitive exam. CT can identify lesions suggestive of COVID-19. It also enables the triage of patients by identifying other diagnoses. Copyright: Ibrahima Niang et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A nested longitudinal study within the Asymptomatic novel CORonavirus iNfection (ACORN) study followed participants with positive nasopharyngeal swab to query for development of symptoms and assess duration of positive RT-PCR test results. Of the 91 participants initially testing positive, 86 participated in follow-up approximately 14 days after study enrollment; of those 86 participants, 19 (22.1%) developed at least one symptom at any time after the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. The median number of days to symptom development after their initial positive test result was 6 (range 1-29 days). No participants reported a SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue or muscle aches (10.5%), headache (9.3%), fever (5.8%), and shortness of breath (5.8%). Of the 78 participants who submitted a nasopharyngeal swab for repeat RT-PCR testing, 17 (21.8%) remained positive at Day 14, 4 of which continued to test positive at Day 28. These findings reinforce the probable role of silent SARS-CoV-2 infections in community transmission, and that reliance on symptom development will miss a large proportion of infections.

It was designed to capture standardised clinical data on community COVID-19 cases. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting to a multimedia screening platform between 13 April and 13 May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days with phone calls every 2 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered additional SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to establish their infection status. We describe the clinical, virological and natural history features of this prospective population-based cohort., FINDINGS: Of 2073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95% CI 25.9 to 30.3) were positive; 604/1136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.9), anosmia (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4) and ageusia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.8) were most strongly associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR or serology. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia and closer to symptom onset. The rates of hospitalisation and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalised group., CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presents in a similar way to other mild community-acquired respiratory diseases, but the presence of fever, anosmia and ageusia can assist the specific diagnosis.

Breastfeeding practices found in this survey confirmed findings from other studies: with high breastfeeding initiation rates and early introduction of other foods/mixed milk feeding. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the associations between breastfeeding, maternal depression and hunger in the household. The odds of hungry mothers breastfeeding were significantly lower (OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.99).

A positive correlation was found between not breastfeeding and not going to the health clinic. Breastfeeding needs to be protected, promoted and supported; and mothers should be encouraged to continue to attend the health clinic. Further to communication to communities, supporting the breastfeeding mother to enable her to breastfeed and feel competent to do so is a critical gap that needs to be addressed. This support could include economic support to enable her to access a nutritious diet. Mothers also need reassurance on the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed.

However, it can also lead to undesirable outcomes if mass vaccination results in increased transmission effective contacts and relaxation of other public health interventions due to the perceived immunity from the vaccine. <h4>Methods: </h4> We designed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that takes into consideration the epidemiological status, public health intervention status (quarantined/isolated), immunity status of the population, and the strain variations. Comparing the control reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes (attack rate) in the cases with and without vaccination, we quantified some key factors determining when vaccination in the population is beneficial for preventing and controlling future outbreaks. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Our analyses predicted that there is a critical (minimal) vaccine efficacy rate (or a critical quarantine rate) below which the control reproduction number with vaccination is higher than that without vaccination, and the final attack rate in the population is also higher with the vaccination. We also predicted the worst case scenario occurs when a high vaccine coverage is achieved for a vaccine with lower efficacy rate and when the vaccines increase the transmission efficient contacts. <h4>Conclusions: </h4> The analyses show that an immunization program with a vaccine efficacy rate below the predicted critical values will not be as effective as simply investing in the contact tracing/quarantine/isolation implementation.

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore the risk factors for development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death and establish a comprehensive risk model. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Higher SOFA, qSOFA, APACHE II and SIRS scores, elevated inflammatory cytokines, dysregulated multi-organ damage biomarkers, decreased immune cell subsets were associated with higher proportion of death (34.17% vs 1.22%; P <0.001) and increased risk odds of death (OR=57.216, 95%CI=28.373-115.378; P <0.001) in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. In addition to previous reported risk factors related to ARDS development and death, such as neutrophils, IL-6, D-Dimer, leukocytes and platelet, we identified elevated TNF-\u03b1 (OR=1.146, 95%CI=1.100-1.194; P <0.001), CK-MB (OR=1.350, 95%CI=1.180-1.545; P <0.001), declined ALB (OR=0.834, 95%CI=0.799-0.872; P <0.001), CD8 + T cells (OR=0.983, 95%CI=0.976-0.990; P <0.001) and CD3 - CD19 + B cells (OR=0.992, 95%CI=0.988-0.997; P =0.003) as novel risk factors. Most importantly, the predictive accuracy of the combined model integrating four score systems and these risk factors demonstrated highest among all models for the development of ARDS (AUC= 0.904) and the progression from ARDS to death (AUC= 0.959). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> COVID-19 patients with ARDS were more likely to develop into death. The potential risk factors and the comprehensive prediction model could be helpful to identify patients that are at risk of developing ARDS with poor prognosis at an early stage, which might help physicians to formulate a timely therapeutic strategy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We calibrate the model to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. The model shows that unless an instrument, such as a vaccine, entirely stops new infections, the pandemic can be persistent due to the non-lasting property of immunity. Output drops because agents search less due to the threat of infections, and trade volumes in each meeting fall.

{"text": "A therapeutic neutralizing antibody targeting receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Vaccines and therapeutics are urgently needed for the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The CT-P59 mAb potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the D614G variant without antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Complex crystal structure of CT-P59 Fab/RBD shows that CT-P59 blocks interaction regions of RBD for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with an orientation that is notably different from previously reported RBD-targeting mAbs. Furthermore, therapeutic effects of CT-P59 are evaluated in three animal models (ferret, hamster, and rhesus monkey), demonstrating a substantial reduction in viral titer along with alleviation of clinical symptoms. Therefore, CT-P59 may be a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model. OBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question., METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity., RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity., CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

{"text": "A prospective, observational study to evaluate adverse drug reactions in patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine: a preliminary report. OBJECTIVES: Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pressure to minimise its impact on public health has led to the implementation of different therapeutic strategies, the efficacy of which for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was unknown at the time. Remdesivir (REM) was granted its first conditional marketing authorisation in the EU in June 2020. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and local health authorities all across the EU have since strongly recommended the implementation of pharmacovigilance activities aimed at further evaluating the safety of this new drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) attributed to either REM or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, a Portuguese hospital centre based in Lisbon. We present the preliminary results reporting plausible adverse effects of either HCQ or REM., METHODS: An observational cohort study was carried out between 16 March and 15 August 2020. Participants were divided into two cohorts: those prescribed an HCQ regimen, and those prescribed REM. Suspected ADRs were identified using an active monitoring model and reported to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System through its online notification tool. The ADR cumulative incidence was compared between the two cohorts., RESULTS: The study included 149 patients, of whom 101 were treated with HCQ and the remaining 48 with REM. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. A total of 102 ADRs were identified during the study period, with a greater incidence in the HCQ cohort compared with the REM cohort (47.5% vs 12.5%; p<0.001). Causality was assessed in 81 ADRs, all of which were considered possible., CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data are crucial to further establish the safety profile for REM.

Background: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine) plus azithromycin is considered as therapy for COVID-19. With benefit evaluations underway, safety concerns due to potential additive effects on QTc prolongation should be addressed. Objective(s): We compared risk of cardiac adverse events between combinations of chloroquine and azithromycin and chloroquine and amoxicillin. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases, 2005-2018. We included autoimmune disease patients aged >=18 years initiating azithromycin or amoxicillin for >=5 days during chloroquine treatment. Patients had continuous insurance coverage >=6 months before combination use until 5 days thereafter or inpatient death. Two outcomes were sudden cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) and cardiac symptoms. We followed patients for up to 5 days to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Covariates were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting. Result(s): We identified two SVC/VA events among >145,000 combination users. The adjusted incidence of cardiac symptoms among azithromycin and amoxicillin users was 276 vs 254 per 10,000 person-years with an adjusted HR of 1.10 (95%CI, 0.62-1.95).

OBJECTIVES: Currently, there is little data on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the pooled and separate prevalence and determinants of depression during the pandemic in samples from four LMICs., METHODS: Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2., RESULTS: The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression symptoms in the LMICs are similar to those reported in China and in most high-income countries during the pandemic.

{"text": "Assessment of Depression Severity During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Among the Palestinian Population: A Growing Concern and an Immediate Consideration. Background: Aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures were implemented as protective public health actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Assessing the psychological effects associated with these measures is an important attempt to inform local policymakers in an early stage. Yet little is known about these effects, specifically depression, among the Palestinians. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression among the Palestinian community during this pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): A cross-sectional web-based survey throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram) was carried out using an anonymous online questionnaire. The validated and standardized depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) was used to measure depression severity. A snowball technique recruiting the general public living in Palestine was conducted. Data were collected between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to the middle interval of strict massive lockdown in Palestine on 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multinomial logistic regression model was developed to predict depression severity. Result(s): About 2,819 respondents filled out the questionnaire. Depression prevalence was (57.5%; n = 1,621). Out of them, 66% had mild/moderate severity, and 34% had severe/extremely severe degree. Depression severity was negatively associated with age {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.98 (0.97-0.99)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.94-0.97)]} degrees compared with normal degree. Males were significantly less likely to have higher depression than females {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.57-0.85)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.40-0.86)]} degree. However, those who reported having inadequate food supply and lesser monthly incomes were more likely to have a higher degree of depression as compared with normal degree. Single persons were significantly more likely to have mild/moderate depression than those in a relationship [OR (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.05-1.64)]. Conclusion(s): High depression prevalence (57.5%) among the Palestinian community during the COVID-19 pandemic is a growing public health concern. It is essential to provide psychological counseling and treatment during and after the pandemic for the targeted people at high risk (young age/female gender) who were affected psychologically. Strategic long-term policy to address pandemic ramifications, including depression, by implementing comprehensive interventions taking into account socioeconomic disparities, vulnerability, and inequities, is crucial to emerge from this crisis in Palestine.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Al Zabadi, Alhroub, Yaseen and Haj-Yahya.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: The psychosocial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are serious for health professionals including nurses because of a higher level of exposure. Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals., Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses., Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress., Conclusion: More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health.

{"text": "Neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: A narrative review for clinicians. INTRODUCTION: The past two decades have been marked by three epidemics linked to emerging coronaviruses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses. The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles., RESULTS: We found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients. Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n=13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n=4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n=5), generalized myoclonus (n=3) and acute transverse myelitis (n=7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n=9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n=26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n=17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n=8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n=5). Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n=3), polyneuritis cranialis (n=2) and facial diplegia (n=2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n=6); critical illness myopathy (n=6). Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries. Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells. We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses. Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients., CONCLUSION: The wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis. There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "G6PD deficiency and severity of COVID19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome: tip of the iceberg?. The severe pneumonia caused by the human coronavirus (hCoV)-SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted heavy casualties, especially among the elderly and those with co-morbid illnesses irrespective of their age. The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X-linked enzyme deficiency, associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated: six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex, co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters-LDH, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support ; 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in normal vs. G6PDd groups included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P = 0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P = 0.05), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P = 0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P = 0.03), and hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P = 0.015). Only one patient with G6PDd died; 16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PDd in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation. It is imperative that further studies are performed to understand the interplay between the viral and host factors in G6PDd that may lead to disparity in outcomes. KEY POINTS: * COVID19 studies show higher mortality in men, due to severe pneumonia and ARDS, indicating possible X-linked mediated differences * G6PD, the most common X-linked enzymopathy, highly prevalent in African Americans and Italians, maintains redox homeostasis. * Preclinical studies using G6PD deficient (G6PDd) cells infected with human coronavirus (hCoV), show impaired cellular responses, viral proliferation and worsening oxidative damage. * Retrospective chart review in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen shows differences between the two groups (Normal and G6PDd) in hematological indices; the G6PDdgroup demonstrated prolonged PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and longer days on mechanical ventilation indicating the severity of the pneumonia.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription complex (RTC) comprising nonstructural protein (nsp) 2-16 plays crucial roles in viral replication, reducing the efficacy of broad-spectrum nucleoside analog drugs such as remdesivir and in evading innate immune responses. Most studies target a specific viral component of the RTC such as the main protease or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast, our strategy is to target <i>multiple</i> conserved domains of the RTC to prevent SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and to create a high barrier to viral resistance or evasion of antiviral drugs. We show that clinically-safe Zn-ejector drugs, disulfiram/ebselen, can target conserved Zn<sup>2+</sup>-sites in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 and nsp14 and inhibit nsp13 ATPase and nsp14 exoribonuclease activities. As the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 domain targeted by disulfiram/ebselen is involved in RNA fidelity control, our strategy allows coupling of the Zn-ejector drug with a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that would otherwise be excised by the nsp14 proofreading domain. As proof-of-concept, we show that disulfiram, when combined with remdesivir, can synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells.

Study Design/Methods: Antibody detection in VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total assay is achieved using SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein antigen coated onto the well. Sample is added to the coated wells in the first stage of the reaction, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody from the sample is captured. After washing, HRP conjugated SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein antigens are added. Following a final wash, bound HRP conjugates are detected using the VITROS signal reagent. The assay cut-off for VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Total is 1.00; values equal to or above the cut-off are Reactive for SARSCoV- 2 antibodies and values below 1.00 are Non-reactive. Clinical testing was performed at the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics R&D lab located in Rochester, NY, USA. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated using 86 samples from 86 individuals diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR, frozen and then sent to the R&D lab for evaluation. Date of reported onset of symptoms were reported for 69 of the 86 samples. Clinical specificity was evaluated using frozen serum and EDTA plasma samples from 400 healthy blood donors collected prior to 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed to calculate the positive percent agreement (PPA) to PCR positivity and the clinical specificity of the assay. A five-day precision study was performed on a 12-member panel including 4 non-reactive, 1 cutoff, 3 weakly reactive and 3 moderately reactive samples using one reagent kit lot and one analyzer.

{"text": "Intravenous Immunoglobulins at the Crossroad of Autoimmunity and Viral Infections. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are blood preparations pooled from the plasma of donors that have been first employed as replacement therapy in immunodeficiency. IVIG interact at multiple levels with the different components of the immune system and exert their activity against infections. Passive immunotherapy includes convalescent plasma from subjects who have recovered from infection, hyperimmune globulin formulations with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). IVIG are used for the prevention and treatment of several infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, or in case of a poorly responsive immune system. The evolution of IVIG from a source of passive immunity to a powerful immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agent results in extensive applications in autoimmune diseases. IVIG composition depends on the antibodies of the donor population and the alterations of protein structure due to the processing of plasma. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG has led us to think that they may represent a useful therapeutic tool even in COVID-19. The human origin of IVIG carries specific criticalities including risks of blood products, supply, and elevated costs.

{"text": "Presence and short-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors. BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) as an investigational new drug for treatment of COVID-19. Since then, collection of CCP from COVID-19-recovered patients has been implemented in donor centers nationwide. Children's Hospital Colorado rapidly put into practice a CCP collection protocol, necessitating development and implementation of assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CCP units., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 87 units of CCP collected from 36 donors over two to four sequential donations using both antigen-binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike antigens and a live virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50 )., RESULTS: Our data show that the majority of donors (83%) had a FRNT50 titer of at least 80, and 61% had a titer of at least 160, which met the FDA's criteria for acceptable CCP units. Additionally, our data indicate that analysis of antibodies to a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen is likely to miss a percentage of seroconverters; however, these individuals tend to have neutralizing antibody titers of less than 80. There was considerable variability in the short-term, sustained antibody response, measured by neutralizing antibody titers, among our donor population., CONCLUSION: The correlation of neutralizing activity and antigen-binding assays is necessary to qualify CCP for therapeutic use. Since SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels decline in a percentage of donors, and such a decline is not detectable by current qualitative assays implemented in many laboratories, robust, quantitative assays are necessary to evaluate CCP units best suited for therapeutic infusion in COVID-19 patients.

Although pre-coating with proteins would reduce the protein corona formation, they may diminish the targeting moieties in the transport process. Patchy NPs can offer unique advantages of asymmetry, heterogeneity, and multi-functions. This has inspired us to use the asymmetry to realize the versatility of NPs, to accommodate stealth and targeting functions. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the adsorption mechanism between patchy NPs and human serum albumin, and the interaction mechanism between NP-HSA and the membrane. The results show that there is a high probability for HSA to interact with the hydrophobic, or charged brushes of patchy NPs. The adsorption sites, as calculated through the contact probability between NPs and the residues, depend on the NP surface properties. Furthermore, the HSA adsorption on NPs could improve the NP-membrane interaction. The simulation results provide deep understanding of the NP interaction mechanism, which would help the NP design for their biomedical applications.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Designing a next generation multi-epitope based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global pandemic by WHO (World Health Organization) in March, 2020. Within 6 months, nearly 750,000 deaths are claimed by COVID-19 across the globe. This called for immediate social, scientific, technological, public and community interventions. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, global efforts are underway to develop preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2. Among the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, Spike (S) glycoprotein (a.k.a S Protein) is the most studied target known to trigger strong host immune response. A detailed analysis of S protein-based epitopes enabled us to design a novel B-cell-derived T-cell Multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine candidate. This involved a systematic and comprehensive computational protocol consisting of prediction of dual-purpose epitopes and designing an MEBP vaccine construct. This was followed by 3D structure validation, MEBP complex interaction studies, in silico cloning and vaccine dose-based immune response simulation to evaluate the immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct. The dual-purpose epitope prediction protocol was designed such that the same epitope elicits both humoral and cellular immune response unlike the earlier designs. Further, the epitopes predicted were screened against stringent criteria to ensure selection of a potent candidate with maximum antigen coverage and best immune response. The vaccine dose-based immune response simulation studies revealed a rapid antigen clearance through antibody generation and elevated levels of cell-mediated immunity during repeated exposure of the vaccine. The favourable results of the analysis strongly indicate that the vaccine construct is indeed a potent vaccine candidate and ready to proceed to the next steps of experimental validation and efficacy studies., Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-020-02574-x.

Background: The global epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is still going on. This article shares information about the infected children from a treatment center in Chongqing, China., Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography results, treatment effect of 11 children infected by 2019-nCoV was performed. Children were diagnosed from January 25 to February 29, 2020 in Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital., Results: The mean age of the 11 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 11 years and 5 months. Two cases (18%) were imported cases from Wuhan. The 9 cases (82%) were family cluster cases. There were 5 asymptomatic type cases (45%), 2 mild cases (18%), and 4 common type cases (37%). The most common symptom was fever (5 cases), cough (3 cases), sore throat (1 case) and diarrhea (1 case). There were abnormal chest CT changes in 6 cases, including 4 cases with patchy ground-glass opacities and 2 cases with thickened lung texture. Laboratory tests showed that procalcitonin increased in 4 cases (36%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased in 1 case (9%). In lymphocyte subgroup examination, lymphocyte count increased in 2 cases (18%) and decreased in 1 case (9%); T%, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T%, and natural killer (NK) cell% were normal in 11 cases; CD4+ T% was increased in 2 cases (18%), and CD4+ T%/CD8+ T% was decreased in 1 case (9%); B% was increased in 1 case (9%).

{"text": "Pilot Production of SARS-CoV-2 Related Proteins in Plants: A Proof of Concept for Rapid Repurposing of Indoor Farms Into Biomanufacturing Facilities. The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the world's capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work, we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies, we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies, we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Role of natural and synthetic immunotropic agents in the prevention of acute respiratory infections. Respiratory tract infections (influenza, acute respiratory infections (ARIs), community-acquired pneumonia, etc.) pose a serious threat to organized groups (including military personnel, cadets, students of military universities, and schools). The most common complication of ARI is community-acquired pneumonia, severe forms of which may result in an unfavorable outcome. The use of some drugs, such as Carmolis ensures a 2.0-3.8 times reduction in the incidence of ARIs in organized groups and a 2.3-3.0 times reduction in the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia. Carmolis has a pronounced non-specific protective effect and increases resistance to respiratory tract infections by promoting nonspecific resistance of the organism. This prevents significant economic damage and reduces the number of complications and poor outcomes.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Dynasty Publishing House.

{"text": "Increased peripheral blood neutrophil activation phenotypes and NETosis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. <h4>Background</h4> Increased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID-19, with pulmonary and systemic inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients. Definitive cellular and molecular pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels over time during COVID-19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision making. <h4>Methods</h4> Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for 11 days. Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), phagocytosis and cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo . Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for immunostaining. <h4>Results</h4> Elevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified in COVID-19 plasma both at the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Neutrophils had exaggerated oxidative burst (p < 0.0001), NETosis (p < 0.0001) and phagocytosis (p < 0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. While elevations in IL-8 and ANC correlated to COVID-19 disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Circulating neutrophils in COVID-19 exhibit an activated phenotype with increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis. Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma IL-8 and circulating neutrophil function may be potential COVID-19 disease biomarkers.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of high dose prophylactic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. BACKGROUND: Due to the high risk of thrombotic complications (TC) during SARS-CoV-2 infection, several scientific societies have proposed to increase the dose of preventive anticoagulation, although arguments in favor of this strategy are inconsistent., RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC?, STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients referred to eight French intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 were included in our observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight., RESULTS: Out of 538 patients included, 104 patients developed a total of 122 TC with an incidence of 22.7 % (19.2-26.3). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52 % of the recorded TC. High dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (HR 0.81 [0.66-0.99]) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR 1.11 [0.70-1.75])., INTERPRETATION: High dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients without an increased risk of hemorrhage.

Public health interventions continue in their attempts to control the epidemic in spite of a lack of information on the scale of silent transmission. <h4>Methods: </h4> To tackle this challenge and the non-stationary aspect of the epidemic we used a modified SEIR stochastic model with time-varying parameters, following Brownian process. This model is coupled with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) for parameter estimation and used mainly confirmed reported hospitalized cases. <h4>Result: </h4> s: Mitigation measures provided an 80% reduction in transmission between March and May 2020. By end of October our estimated seroprevalence rate was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.5%\u20132.8%) far from herd immunity. We estimated that the proportion of asymptomatic transmission was approximately 40% but with large uncertainty (95% CI: 14%\u201373%). Finally we demonstrate that the available observed confirmed cases are not reliable for any analysis owing to the fact that their reporting rate has greatly evolved. <h4>Conclusion: </h4> We provide the first estimations of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland and its key parameters. We also quantify the effects of mitigation measures on the virus transmission before, during and after mitigation. Our results demonstrate that Ireland has significantly reduced transmission by employing mitigation measures, physical distancing and lockdown.

{"text": "Optimal strategies for social distancing and testing to control COVID-19. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 79 million individuals, with 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing.Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The rocaglate CR-31-B (-) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at non-cytotoxic, low nanomolar concentrations in vitro and ex vivo. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease with varying clinical presentations and outcomes, and responsible for a major pandemic that started in early 2020. With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 of ~1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions., METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a 52-day period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population., RESULTS: Of the 1103 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 529 required hospitalization and were included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (52%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the \"obese\" range. 98% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (79%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (56%) and chronic kidney disease (17%). Patients with chronic kidney disease who received hemodialysis were found to have lower mortality, than those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis Age > 60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (8.3:10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 h.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The magnitude and drivers of excess cerebrovascular-specific mortality during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are unknown. We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19-related vascular pathology., METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29)., RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later.

We developed a series of recombinant human type 5 adenoviruses that express the full-length or membrane-truncated spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 (AdCoV2-S or AdCoV2-SdTM, respectively). We tested the immunoprotective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal (i.n.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization in a rodent model following two-dose immunizations. Mucosal delivery of adenovirus (Ad) vaccines could induce anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in the serum and in the mucosal, respectively as indicated by vaginal wash (vw). Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG but not IgA was induced in the vw by s.c. injection of AdCoV2-S. Intranasal administration of AdCoV2-S was able to induce higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels than s.c. injection. Immunization with AdCoV2-SdTM induced a lower antibody response than AdCoV2-S. In addition, the degree of neutralization of clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 in the serum correlated with the above anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses; the most potent neutralizing activity was observed in the AdCoV2-S i.n. group, and less viral neutralizing activity was observed in response to AdCoV2-S s.c. and AdCoV2dTM i.n. Novelty, S-specific IgG1 which represented Th2-mediated humoral response was dominantly induced in Ad i.n.-immunized serum in contrast to more IgG2a which represented Th1-mediated cellular response found in Ad s.c.-immunized serum. The activation of S-specific IFN-\u0263 and IL-4 in Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, was observed in the AdCoV2s i.n. and s.c. groups, indicating the Th1/Th2-balenced immunity was activated. During the protection study, two doses of i.n. AdCoV2-S or i.n. AdCoV2-SdTM significantly prevented body weight loss and reduced pulmonary viral loads in hamsters. A significant reduction in inflammation in the lungs was observed in AdCoV-S-immunized hamsters following a SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

The aim of this study was to identify the predictors for the clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 who did not show clinical deterioration upon hospital admission., METHODS: Two-hundred fifty-seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital between January 23 and March 21, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, and treatments were all collected. The study endpoint was clinical deterioration within 20 days from hospital admission. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration., RESULTS: A total of 49 (19%) patients showed clinical deterioration after admission. Compared with patients that did not experience clinical deterioration, clinically deteriorated patients had more dyspnea, cough and myalgia (65.3% versus 29.3%) symptoms and more had comorbidities (89.8% versus 36.1%).

Method(s): We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute care hospital and the United States. Result(s): For an acute care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% IPR: 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR: 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day).

There has been a markedly renewed interest in factors associated with pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide, due to its frequent concurrence with pandemics of influenza and Covid-19 disease. Reported predisposing factors to both bacterial pneumonia and pandemic viral lower respiratory infections are wintertime occurrence, older age, obesity, pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes. Also implicated are age-related neurodegenerative diseases that cause parkinsonism and dementia. We investigated the prevalence of autopsy-proven pneumonia in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study, between the years 2006 and 2019 and before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of 691 subjects dying at advanced ages (mean 83.4), pneumonia was diagnosed postmortem in 343 (49.6%). There were 185 subjects without dementia or parkinsonism while clinicopathological diagnoses for the other subjects included 319 with Alzheimer's disease dementia, 127 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 49 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 78 with vascular dementia. Subjects with one or more of these neurodegenerative diseases all had higher pneumonia rates, ranging between 50 and 61%, as compared to those without dementia or parkinsonism (40%). In multivariable logistic regression models, male sex and a non-summer death both had independent contributions (ORs of 1.67 and 1.53) towards the presence of pneumonia at autopsy while the absence of parkinsonism or dementia was a significant negative predictor of pneumonia (OR 0.54). Male sex, dementia and parkinsonism may also be risk factors for Covid-19 pneumonia. The apolipoprotein E4 allele, as well as obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly and cigarette smoking history, were not significantly associated with pneumonia, in contradistinction to what has been reported for Covid-19 disease.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Combining serology with case-detection, to allow the easing of restrictions against SARS-CoV-2: a modelling-based study in India. India's lockdown and subsequent restrictions against SARS-CoV-2, if lifted without any other mitigations in place, could risk a second wave of infection. A test-and-isolate strategy, using PCR diagnostic tests, could help to minimise the impact of this second wave. Meanwhile, population-level serological surveillance can provide valuable insights into the level of immunity in the population. Using a mathematical model, consistent with an Indian megacity, we examined how seroprevalence data could guide a test-and-isolate strategy, for fully lifting restrictions. For example, if seroprevalence is 20% of the population, we show that a testing strategy needs to identify symptomatic cases within 5-8 days of symptom onset, in order to prevent a resurgent wave from overwhelming hospital capacity in the city. This estimate is robust to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the lockdown, as well as in immune protection against reinfection. To set these results in their economic context, we estimate that the weekly cost of such a PCR-based testing programme would be less than 2.1% of the weekly economic loss due to the lockdown. Our results illustrate how PCR-based testing and serological surveillance can be combined to design evidence-based policies, for lifting lockdowns in Indian cities and elsewhere.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The experience of contact tracing in Singapore in the control of COVID-19: highlighting the use of digital technology. Purpose: Containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would require aggressive contact tracing and isolation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. Method(s): An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. Result(s): Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. Conclusion(s): Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.Copyright \u00a9 2020, SICOT aisbl.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The clinical course and viral detection period in mild or asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are not yet known. The presumed low diagnostic sensitivity of upper respiratory specimens for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) makes it difficult to confirm infection and recommend de-isolation. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who were admitted at the Daegu-Gyeongbuk 7th community treatment centre in Korea between 9 March 2020 and 10 April 2020. Patients underwent an upper respiratory RT-PCR test every week until discharge. From the RT-PCR results, we evaluated the rate of prolonged (>3 weeks) SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. We analysed the proportion of reversed results, defined as a positive or indeterminate result one day after a negative RT-PCR result, according to time (<14, 15-21, 22-28, >28 days) from the initial positive RT-PCR result. Result(s): In 23% (69/300) of patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected more than 3 weeks after the initial positive RT-PCR. In 14% (42/300) of patients, the RT-PCR results were positive for more than 4 weeks. For 37.5% (152/405) of negative RT-PCR results, the results were reversed in the next day's test. And 43.5% (123/283) of negative RT-PCR results were reversed within 3 weeks of diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The detection of SARS-CoV-2 lasting more than 3 weeks was common in mild or asymptomatic patients. Upper respiratory RT-PCR results were frequently reversed from negative to positive.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Society for Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "ALLY in fighting COVID-19: magnitude of albumin decline and lymphopenia (ALLY) predict progression to critical disease. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is straining hospitals. Judicious resource allocation is paramount but difficult due to the unpredictable disease course. Once hospitalized, discerning which patients may progress to critical disease would be valuable for resource planning. Medical records were reviewed for consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large healthcare system in Texas. The main outcome was progression to critical disease within 10 days from admission. Albumin trends from admission to 7 days were analyzed using mixed-effects models, and progression to critical disease was modeled by multivariable logistic regression of laboratory results. Risk models were evaluated in an independent group. Of 153 non-critical patients, 28 (18%) progressed to critical disease. The rate of decrease in mean baseline-corrected (DELTA) albumin was -0.08 g/dL/day (95% CI -0.11 to -0.04; p<0.001) or four times faster, in those who progressed compared with those who did not progress. A model of DELTA albumin combined with lymphocyte percentage predicting progression to critical disease was validated in 60 separate patients (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.74). ALLY (delta albumin and lymphocyte percentage) is a simple tool to identify patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of disease progression when: (1) a 0.9 g/dL or greater albumin drop from baseline within 5 days of admission or (2) baseline lymphocyte of <=10% is observed. The ALLY tool identified >70% of hospitalized cases that progressed to critical COVID-19 disease. We recommend prospectively tracking albumin.

The new coronavirus that was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan China, now called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, has spread from China to the entire world in a few months. Due to its contagious potential (R0: 5.7) and because there is still no effective treatment to stop the infection, and a vaccine for prevention it is not yet available to the general population, COVID-19 is currently considered a global health problem. The need to implement sensitive methods for the identification of individuals with COVID-19 has led to the development of different molecular and immunological tests. The importance of a timely and accurate diagnosis is essential to determine the course of the pandemic. The interpretation of the results obtained by each test as well as the factors that affect these results have not been fully described. In this review, we describe and analyze the different SARS-CoV-2 detection methods that have been performed in Mexico and are available worldwide, outlining their strengths and weaknesses.

BACKGROUND: With COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) offering an early treatment option for COVID-19, blood collectors needed to quickly overcome obstacles to recruiting and qualifying eligible donors. We provide attributes of CCP donors and products and compare to standard donors and products., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Information on CCP donors was gathered from the American Red Cross qualification website through product collection. Data from 2019 for standard plasma/platelet apheresis (SA) and whole blood (WB) donor demographics and SA donations including product disposition and reactions were used for comparison., RESULTS: Of almost 59K donors registering on the website, 75% reported an existing COVID-19 diagnostic PCR or an antibody test. The majority (56.2%) of 10,231 CCP donors were first-time donors in contrast to SA or WB donor populations, which were only 3.0 and 30.6%, respectively, first-time donors. The number of female donors was 12% higher than SA donors. Older (> 65 years) and younger (16-19 years) were comparatively underrepresented in CCP donors. Deferral (10.2%) and Quantity Not Sufficient rates (6.4%) for presenting CCP donations were higher than SA (8.2 and 1.1%, respectively). HLA antibody reactivity was the highest cause of product loss for CCP donations vs. SA donations (9.6 vs. 1.3%). Acute adverse events also occurred at a higher rate among both first-time and repeat CCP donations compared to SA., CONCLUSION: CCP donors were more likely to be first-time and female than WB or SA donors.

{"text": "Neurologic Syndromes Predict Higher In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The SARS-Cov2 virus is protean in its manifestations, affecting nearly every organ system. However, nervous system involvement and its impact on disease outcome are poorly characterized. The objective of the study is to determine if neurological syndromes are associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality., METHODS: 581 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection, neurological involvement and brain-imaging were compared to hospitalized non-neurological COVID-19 patients. Four patterns of neurological manifestations were identified -acute stroke, new or recrudescent seizures, altered mentation with normal imaging, and neuro-COVID-19 complex. Factors present on admission were analyzed as potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing comorbidities, vital-signs, laboratory values, and pattern of neurological manifestations. Significant predictors were incorporated into a disease-severity score. Patients with neurological manifestations were matched with patients of the same age and disease severity to assess the risk of death., RESULTS: 4711 patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 infection were admitted to one medical system in New York City during a 6-week period. Of these, 581 (12%) had neurological issues of sufficient concern to warrant neuro-imaging. These patients were compared to 1743 non-neurological COVID-19 patients matched for age and disease-severity admitted during the same period. Patients with altered mentation (n=258, p =0.04, OR 1.39, CI 1.04 - 1.86) or radiologically confirmed stroke (n=55, p = 0.001, OR 3.1, CI 1.65-5.92) had a higher risk of mortality than age and severity-matched controls., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of altered mentation or stroke on admission predicts a modest but significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality independent of disease severity. While other biomarker factors also predict mortality, measures to identify and treat such patients may be important in reducing overall mortality of COVID-19. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control 1-2 . Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients 1-3 , how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro -derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo -like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNT hi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type 4 . These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Defining the features and duration of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with disease severity and outcome. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, can neutralize the virus. It is, however, unknown which features of the serological response may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 983 longitudinal plasma samples from 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 175 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Within this cohort, 25 patients died of their illness. Higher ratios of IgG antibodies targeting S1 or RBD domains of spike compared to nucleocapsid antigen were seen in outpatients who had mild illness versus severely ill patients. Plasma antibody increases correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, but antibody responses in acute illness were insufficient to predict inpatient outcomes. Pseudovirus neutralization assays and a scalable ELISA measuring antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interaction were well correlated with patient IgG titers to RBD.

Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, including all patients with aortovascular conditions admitted for surgical or conservative treatment from the 1st March to the 20th May 2020., RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were analyzed, and 182 underwent surgery. Diagnosis included: aneurysm (45%), acute aortic syndrome (44%), pseudoaneurysm (4%), aortic valve endocarditis (4%), and other (3%). Timing for surgery was: emergency (40%), urgent (34%), or elective (26%). In-hospital mortality was 12%. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the peri-operative period, and this subgroup was not associated with a higher mortality., CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant change in service provision for aortovascular patients in the UK. Although the emergency and urgent surgical activity were maintained, elective treatment was minimal during early months of the pandemic. The preoperative COVID-19 screening protocol, combined with self-isolation and shielding, contributed to the low incidence of COVID-19 in our series and a mortality similar to that of pre-pandemic outcomes.

{"text": "Partial N Gene Sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 Verification and Pathway Tracing. When SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is low, many RT-qPCR-positive test results are false positives. Sequencing of a 398-bp cDNA PCR amplicon derived from a highly conserved segment with single nucleotide polymorphisms of the nucleocapsid (N) gene in presumptive positive samples can verify true positives and differentiate at least 27 phylogenetically distinct strains of SARS-CoV-2 for helping track virus strain movement between individuals and across geographical areas. We report using this partial N gene sequencing method to confirm a case of mild COVID-19 disease. The patient was first seen on March 15, 2020, in the emergency department of the university hospital in Dublin, Ireland. RT-qPCR test on a nasopharyngeal swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Partial sequencing of the N gene in the residue of the tested RNA extract showed a characteristic set of 3-consecutive GGG-to-AAC mutations at positions 28881, 28882, 28883, which is known to first appear in samples collected in Continental Europe in February 2020. Using this sequencing-based method to re-test 9 reference nasopharyngeal swab samples supplied by the Connecticut State Department of Public Health Microbiology Laboratory revealed that 2 of the 9 positive samples had a single nucleotide mutation in the 398-base segment of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. One of the 2 mutant samples showed a mutation at position 28821, which was first reported in a sample recently collected in the neighboring New York state. The other sample showed a novel frameshift nucleotide \"A\" insertion between position 29051 and position 29057, which co-existed with its wildtype parental virus in one sample.

Objective: With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the healthcare workers (HCWs) require proper respiratory personal protective equipment (rPPE) against viral respiratory infectious diseases (VRIDs). It is necessary to evaluate which type of mask and manner of wearing is the best suitable rPPE for preventing the VRID. Study design: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively analyze the protective efficacy of various rPPE. Method(s): This network meta-analysis protocol was registered in an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020179489). Electronic databases were searched for cluster randomized control trials (RCTs) of comparing the effectiveness of rPPE and wearing manner in preventing HCWs from VRID. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% credibility interval (CrI). The secondary outcome was the incidence of clinical respiratory illness (CRI) reported as an OR with the associated 95% CrI. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) provided a ranking of each rPPE according to the primary outcome and the secondary outcome as data supplement. Result(s): Six studies encompassing 12,265 HCWs were included. In terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection, the continuous wearing of N95 respirators (network OR, 0.48; 95% CrI: 0.27 to 0.86; SUCRA score, 85.4) showed more effective than the control group. However, in terms of reducing the incidence of CRI, there was no rPPE showing superior protective effectiveness. Conclusion(s): There are significant differences in preventive efficacy among current rPPE.

{"text": "Opportunities to improve COVID-19 provider communication resources: A systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Communication related to COVID-19 between provider and the patient/family is impacted by isolation requirements, time limitations, and lack of family/partner access. Our goal was to determine the content of provider communication resources and peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 communication in order to identify opportunities for developing future COVID-19 communication curricula and support tools., METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the UpToDate clinical decision support resource database, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The grey literature review was conducted in September 2020 and articles published between January-September 2020 written in English were included., RESULTS: A total of 89 sources were included in the review, (n = 36 provider communication resources, n = 53 peer-reviewed articles). Resources were available for all providers, mainly physicians, and consisted of general approaches to COVID-19 communication with care planning as the most common topic. Only four resources met best practices for patient-centered communication. All but three articles described physician communication where a general emphasis on patient communication was the most prevalent topic. Reduced communication channels, absence of family, time, burnout, telemedicine, and reduced patient-centered care were identified as communication barriers. Communication facilitators were team communication, time, patient-centered and family communication, and available training resources., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, resources lack content that address non-physician providers, communication with family, and strategies for telehealth communication to promote family engagement. The gaps identified in this review reveal a need to develop more materials on the following topics: provider moral distress, prevention communication, empathy and compassion, and grief and bereavement. An evidence-base and theoretical grounding in communication theory is also needed., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future development of COVID-19 communication resources for providers should address members of the interdisciplinary team, communication with family, engagement strategies for culturally-sensitive telehealth interactions, and support for provider moral distress.

{"text": "Emerging Evidence on Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: a Systematic Review with Meta-analysis. With the increased spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, more patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are being reported worldwide. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the clinical features, proposed pathogenesis and current treatment options for effective management of children with this novel entity. Electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, WHO, CDC, UK National Health Service, LitCovid, and other databases with unpublished pre-prints) were extensively searched, and all articles on MIS-C published from January 1, 2020, to October 10, 2020, were retrieved. English language studies were included. This systematic review analysed 17 studies with 992 MIS-C patients from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and developed countries (France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Chile and the US CDC data). Fever (95%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by gastrointestinal (78%), cardiovascular (75.5%), and respiratory system (55.3%) involvement. Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was present. Though the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, virus-induced post-infective immune dysregulation appears to play a predominant role. Features resembling Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome were present; 49% had shock; 32% had myocarditis; 18% had coronary vessel abnormalities and 9% had congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-three percent of the patients were admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); 63% received intravenous immunoglobulin, 58% received corticosteroids and 19% received alternate agents like tocilizumab; there were 22 (2.2%) deaths. Only 9/144 children in LMICs received tocilizumab that was significantly less than children in developed countries (p < 0.0001). This systematic review delineates and summarises recently published data on MIS-C from LMICs and developed countries. Although most needed PICU admission and received treatment with IVIG and steroids, most of the patients survived. Significantly fewer patients in developing countries received tocilizumab therapy than those in developed countries. It is crucial for clinician to recognise MIS-C, to differentiate it from other defined inflammatory conditions and initiate early treatment. Further studies are needed for long-term prognosis, especially relating to cardiac complications of MIS-C., Supplementary Information: The online version of this article (10.1007/s42399-020-00690-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

{"text": "Evaluation of serological lateral flow assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. <h4>Background</h4> COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. <h4>Methods</h4> We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays\u2019 performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. <h4>Results</h4> Combined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 \u03bcg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 \u03bcg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek. <h4>Conclusion</h4> We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Immune reactivity during COVID-19: Implications for treatment. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The main hematological laboratory findings associated with the severe form of disease are represented by lymphopenia and eosinopenia which mostly occur in the elderly population characterized by cardiovascular comorbidities and immunosenescence. Besides, increased levels of D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C reactive protein (CRP) seem to be powerful prognostic biomarkers helping to predict the onset of coagulopathy. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an aberrant inflammatory response or \"cytokine storm\" which contributes to the severity of illness. At immunological level, patients affected by a severe form of COVID-19 show poor clinical trajectories characterized by differential \"immunotypes\" for which T cell response seems to play a critical role in understanding pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Also, patients with mild to severe COVID-19 displayed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression with a parallel reduction of CD04+ lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Corticosteroids resulted the best therapy for the immune dysregulation whereas repurposing of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) appears to have mixed results in patients with COVID-19. Besides, anticoagulative therapy was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and need of intubation among COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the beneficial use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma needs to be validated in large controlled clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the main hematological parameters with a prognostic value in COVID-19 and the basis of immunological reactivity during COVID-19, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials evaluating immune targets as possible therapeutic strategies.Copyright \u00a9 2021 European Federation of Immunological Societies", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of thromboembolism in mild/ moderate COVID-19. All of the patients had normal coagulation tests and had no overt thrombotic complications. It is important to screen the thrombotic status in mild/moderate COVID-19., METHODS: From June 11 to July 8, 2020, 23 patients with mild/ moderate COVID-19 pneumonia consented to having a CTPA (CT pulmonary angiography) + CTV (CT venography) scans for the lung and extremity veins. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed in all patients for screening. The incidence, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging features and prognosis of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) were analyzed and compared with those COVID-19 pneumonia patients without VTE., RESULTS: 19 patients (82.6%) had VTE, mainly distal limb thrombosis. Only one of the VTE were screened by DUS, the other VTE were negative by DUS. All of the mild / moderate patients with VTE were screened by CTPA + CTV. The blood tests for inflammatory, coagulation and biochemistry parameters were all in normal scope except for the WBC and LDH., CONCLUSIONS: With CTV screening for DVT, we found the incidence of thrombosis in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients was soared to 82.6% (19/23).

{"text": "ARIA-EAACI statement on severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines -- an EAACI-ARIA Position Paper. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine BNT162b2 received approval and within the first few days of public vaccination several severe anaphylaxis cases occurred. An investigation is taking place to understand the cases and their triggers. The vaccine will be administered to a large number of individuals worldwide and concerns raised for severe adverse events might occur. With the current information, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) states its position for the following preliminary recommendations that are to be revised as soon as more data emerges. To minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions in vaccinated individuals, it is urgently required to understand the specific nature of the reported severe allergic reactions, including the background medical history of the individuals affected and the mechanisms involved. To achieve this goal all clinical and laboratory information should be collected and reported. Mild and moderate allergic patients should not be excluded from the vaccine as the exclusion of all these patients from vaccination may have a significant impact on reaching the goal of population immunity. Health care practitioners vaccinating against COVID-19 are required to be sufficiently prepared to recognise and treat anaphylaxis properly with the ability to administer adrenaline. A mandatory observation period after vaccine administration of at least 15 minutes for all individuals should be followed. The current guidelines, which exclude patients with severe allergies from vaccination with BNT162b2, should be re-evaluated after more information and experience with the new vaccine develops.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Advanced Adverse Outcome Pathways Potentially Bridging the Pathogenesis of COVID-19. Increasing global concern over COVID-19 has recently brought greater attention to studies due to the ease of person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. Here, we proposed the application of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework to support re-search on the pathogenesis of viral disease. We first constructed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) applicable to COVID-19 management to understand whether the infection causes severe acute respiratory distress. Based on the AOP framework where mechanistic elucidation of the pathway from the interaction of chemicals (or viruses) to apical endpoints is represented, our COVID-19 AOP indicated that the molecular initiating event (MIE) was angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, and the key events (KEs) were the increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells, with increased mortality as an apical adverse outcome (AO). However, there is still limited information on the toxicity mechanisms of AOPs in COVID-19; therefore, detailed KEs and AOs on toxicity mechanisms will be required to fill these gaps in the data. This study demonstrated that the COVID-19 AOP framework is a suitable tool to design new drugs and to integrate crowded-sourced information for the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The ancient cardioprotective mechanisms of ACE2 bestow SARS-CoV-2 with a wide host range. SARS-CoV-2 infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously anticipated, suggesting there may be additional unknown hosts wherein the virus can evolve and potentially circumvent effective vaccines. We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> A conserved mechanism essential for ACE2 catalytic activity is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 binding, allowing the virus to infect a wide range of species.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Vaccine Prioritisation Using Bluetooth Exposure Notification Apps. After vaccinating health care workers and vulnerable groups against COVID-19, authorities will need to decide how to vaccinate everyone else. Prioritising individuals with more contacts can be disproportionately effective, in theory, but identifying these individuals is difficult. Here we show that the technology underlying Bluetooth exposure notification applications, such as used for digital contact tracing, can be leveraged to prioritise vaccination based on individual contact data. Our approach is based on the insight that these apps also act as local sensing devices measuring each user's total exposure time to other users, thereby enabling the implementation of a previously impossible strategy that prioritises potential super-spreaders. Furthermore, by generalising percolation theory and introducing a novel measure of vaccination efficiency, we demonstrate that this ``hot-spotting\" strategy can achieve herd immunity with up to half as many vaccines as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Multi-organ complement deposition in COVID-19 patients. <h4>Background</h4> Increased levels of circulating complement activation products have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but only limited information is available on complement involvement at tissue level. The mechanisms and pathways of local complement activation remain unclear. <h4>Methods</h4> We performed immunofluorescence analyses of autopsy specimens of lungs, kidney and liver from nine COVID-19 patients who died of acute respiratory failure. Snap-frozen samples embedded in OCT were stained with antibodies against complement components and activation products, IgG and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. <h4>Findings</h4> Lung deposits of C1q, C4, C3 and C5b-9 were localized in the capillaries of the interalveolar septa and on alveolar cells. IgG displayed a similar even distribution, suggesting classical pathway activation. The spike protein is a potential target of IgG, but its uneven distribution suggests that other viral and tissue molecules may be targeted by IgG. Factor B deposits were also seen in COVID-19 lungs and are consistent with activation of the alternative pathway, whereas MBL and MASP-2 were hardly detectable. Analysis of kidney and liver specimens mirrored findings observed in the lung. Complement deposits were seen on tubules and vessels of the kidney with only mild C5b-9 staining in glomeruli, and on hepatic artery and portal vein of the liver. <h4>Interpretation</h4> Complement deposits in different organs of deceased COVID-19 patients caused by activation of the classical and alternative pathways support the multi-organ nature of the disease. <h4>Funding</h4> Grants from the Italian Ministry of Health (COVID-2020-12371808) to PLM and National Institutes of Health HL150146 to NP are gratefully acknowledged.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to more than 216 countries and has put global public health at high risk. The world urgently needs a cost-effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we engineered the Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike protein (S) variants (Receptor binding domain, RBD and S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2 genes and produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The purification yields were at least 20 mg of pure protein/kg of plant biomass for each target protein. The S protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 showed specific binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The purified plant produced N and S variants were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S protein variants. In addition, IgG responses of plant produced N and S antigens elicited significantly high titers of antibody in mice. This is the first report demonstrating production of functional active S1 domain and Nucleocapsid protein of SARC-CoV-2 in plants. In addition, in this study, for the first time, we report the co-expression of RBD with N protein to produce a cocktail antigen of SARS-CoV-2, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N proteins.

Investigating the spatial distribution characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and exploring the influence of environmental factors that drive it is the basis for formulating rational and efficient prevention and control countermeasures. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with the environmental factors. Based on the incidences of new local COVID-19 cases in Beijing from June 11 to July 5, the spatial clustering characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing was investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The relation between COVID-19 cases and environmental factors was assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explore the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the development of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing from June 11 to July 5 could be divided into two stages. The first stage was the outward expansion from June 11 to June 21, and the second stage (from June 22 to July 5) was the growth of the transmission in areas with existing previous cases. In addition, there was a ring of low value clusters around the Xinfadi market. This area was the key area for prevention and control. Population density and distance to Xinfadi market were the most critical factors that explained the pandemic development.

PURPOSE: To analyze pulmonary embolism (PE) on chest computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in hospitalized patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, according to the severity of lung disease based both on temporal CT features changes and on CT-severity lung involvement (CT-severity score), along with the support of clinical and laboratory findings., METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 170 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent CTPA examination for PE suspicion. Pulmonary arteries diameters, right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio, presence, absence, and distribution of PE, pulmonary artery obstructive index (PAO index), and lobe involvement were recorded. All CT scans were reviewed to assess temporal CT changes and the COVID CT-severity score., RESULTS: A total of 76 out of 170 patients (44.7%) developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease. The majority PE-positive patients were hospitalized in non-intensive wards. PE-positive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PE-negative ones. In the three months of study, overall 85.9% of patients were discharged while 14.1% died, of whom 13 PE-positive (54.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection present a higher cumulative incidence of PE compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, regardless of the severity of lung inflammation or the temporal stage of the disease.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to its immunomodulatory effects is believed to influence outcomes in COVID-19. We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients, hospitalized with COVID-19. Serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL was considered VDD. Patients were classified as having mild and severe disease on basis of the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI). Of the 410 patients recruited, patients with VDD (197,48\u22192%) were significantly younger and had lesser comorbidities. The proportion of severe cases (13\u22192% vs.14\u22196%), mortality (2% vs. 5\u22192%), oxygen requirement (34\u22195% vs.43\u22194%), ICU admission (14\u22197% vs.19\u22198%) was not significantly different between patients with or without VDD. There was no significant correlation between serum 25-OHD levels and inflammatory markers studied. Serum parathormone levels correlated with D-dimer (r 0\u2219117, p- 0\u2219019), ferritin (r 0\u2219132, p-0\u2219010), and LDH (r 0\u2219124, p-0\u2219018).

{"text": "Glycan reactive anti-HIV-1 antibodies bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do not block viral entry. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is a focal point for vaccine immunogen and therapeutic antibody design, and also serves as a critical antigen in the evaluation of immune responses to COVID-19. A common feature amongst enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 is the propensity for displaying host-derived glycans on entry spike proteins. Similarly displayed glycosylation motifs can serve as the basis for glyco-epitope mediated cross-reactivity by antibodies, which can have important implications on virus neutralization, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and the interpretation of antibody titers in serological assays. From a panel of nine anti-HIV-1 gp120 reactive antibodies, we selected two (PGT126 and PGT128) that displayed high levels of cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We report that these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and are unlikely to mediate ADE via Fc\u03b3RII receptor engagement. Nevertheless, ELISA and other immunoreactivity experiments demonstrate these antibodies are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike in a glycan-dependent manner. These results contribute to the growing literature surrounding SARS-CoV-2 S cross-reactivity, as we demonstrate the ability for cross-reactive antibodies to interfere in immunoassays.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Afucosylated IgG characterizes enveloped viral responses and correlates with COVID-19 severity. IgG antibodies are crucial for protection against invading pathogens. A highly conserved N-linked glycan within the IgG-Fc tail, essential for IgG function, shows variable composition in humans. Afucosylated IgG variants are already used in anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies for their elevated activity through Fc receptors (FcgammaRIIIa). Here, we report that afucosylated IgG (~6% of total IgG in humans) are specifically formed against enveloped viruses but generally not against other antigens. This mediates stronger FcgammaRIIIa responses, but also amplifies brewing cytokine storms and immune-mediated pathologies. Critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not those with mild symptoms, had high levels of afucosylated IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine release and acute phase responses. Thus, antibody glycosylation plays a critical role in immune responses to enveloped viruses, including COVID-19.

To address this limitation, in this study we used a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 pandemic to collect data worldwide during October 2-30, 2020 (1,233 individuals) in a structured way for analyzing factors and characteristics of affected individuals in relation to BCG vaccination. For the first time, the results of our study suggested that vaccination with BCG may increase the risk for COVID-19 at certain age, particularly in individuals vaccinated at childhood.

We examine whether mindfulness can neutralize the negative impact of COVID-19 stressors on employees' sleep duration and work engagement. In Study 1, we conducted a field experiment in Wuhan, China during the lockdown between February 20, 2020, and March 2, 2020, in which we induced state mindfulness by randomly assigning participants to either a daily mindfulness practice or a daily mind-wandering practice. Results showed that the sleep duration of participants in the mindfulness condition, compared with the control condition, was less impacted by COVID-19 stressors (i.e., the increase of infections in the community). In Study 2, in a 10-day daily diary study in the United Kingdom between June 8, 2020, and June 19, 2020, we replicate our results from Study 1 using a subjective measure of COVID-19 stressors and a daily measure of state mindfulness. In addition, we find that mindfulness buffers the negative effect of COVID-19 stressors on work engagement mediated by sleep duration.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets/aerosols and it causes COVID-19. The virus infects epithelial cells by using the spike protein on its surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cells. Thus, candidate vaccines targeting the spike protein are currently being developed to prevent against infections. Approximately 44 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials (phase I-III) and an additional 164 candidates are in preclinical stages. The efficacy data from phase I/II trials of lead candidate vaccines look very promising with virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers in the range of 16.6-3906. Most recently, two SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been granted the first emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S.; BNT162b2 has also been granted an EUA in the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the European Union.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection can cause alterations in the coagulation mechanism conditioning thrombotic phenomena such as Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) as the only manifestation of the infection. The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with SARS COV-2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru., METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six General Hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution and discharge conditions., RESULTS: Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60 +/- 15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). Main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93,2% patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients and amputation (primary and secondary) in 30%. Mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)., CONCLUSIONS: ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes.

Passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19.

Here, we describe deep-mining of the antibody repertoires of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a combination of phage display technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralising antibodies and gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded potent neutralising antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action, including the identification of a novel non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody that is not expected to be affected by any of the major viral variants reported. The study highlighted the presence of potent neutralising antibodies with near germline sequences within both the IgG and IgM pools at early stages of infection. Furthermore, we highlight a highly convergent antibody response with the same sequences occurring both within this study group and also within the responses described in previously published anti-SARS-CoV-2 studies.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Of 115 sera collected >=61 days after onset of illness tested using plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays, 99.1% remained seropositive for both 90% (PRNT90) and 50% (PRNT50) neutralization endpoints. We estimate that it takes at least 372, 416 and 133 days for PRNT50 titres to drop to the detection limit of a titre of 1:10 for severe, mild and asymptomatic patients, respectively. At day 90 after onset of symptoms (or initial RT-PCR detection in asymptomatic infections), it took 69, 87 and 31 days for PRNT50 antibody titres to decrease by half (T1/2) in severe, mild and asymptomatic infections, respectively. Patients with severe disease had higher peak PRNT90 and PRNT50 antibody titres than patients with mild or asymptomatic infections.

There are three main forms of vitamin A, retinol, retinal and retinoic acid (RA) with the latter being most biologically active and all-trans-RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune-homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon-based innate immune response to RNA viruses decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.During the Covid-19 pandemic interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulator drugs have been tried but most of them are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings.

However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases., METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review., RESULTS: CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications.

Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) is one of the most devastating epidemics in the 21st century, which has caused considerable damage to the physical and mental health of human beings. Despite a few regions like China having controlled the epidemic trends, most countries are still under siege of COVID-19. As the emphasis on cleaning and hygiene has been increasing, the problems related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may appear. Objective: This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of OCD in the urban population in Wuhan during the stage of regular epidemic control and prevention. Meanwhile, characteristics and risk factors for OCD were also explored. Method: Five-hundred and seventy residents in urban areas of Wuhan were recruited using the snowball sampling method to complete questionnaires and an online interview from July 9 to July 19, 2020. Collected information encompassed socio-demographics, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores, Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) scores and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI) values. Results: Three months after lifting the quarantine in Wuhan, the prevalence of OCD was 17.93%. About 89% of OCD patients had both obsessions and compulsions, while 8% had only obsessions and 3% had only compulsions. Top 3 common dimensions of obsessions were miscellaneous (84.0%), aggressive (76.6%), and contamination (48.9%), and of compulsions were miscellaneous (64%), checking (51.7%), and cleaning/washing/repeating (31.5%). The unmarried were more vulnerable to OCD than the married (p < 0.05, odds ration = 1.836). Students had 2.103 times the risk of developing OCD than health care workers (p < 0.05). Those with positive family history of OCD and other mental disorders (p < 0.05, odds ration = 2.497) and presence of psychiatric comorbidity (p < 0.05, odds ration = 4.213) were also at higher risk. Each level increase in sleep latency increased the risk of OCD to 1.646 times (p < 0.05). Conclusion:  In the background of regular epidemic control, the prevalence of OCD was high, and the symptoms were widely distributed. Obsessions often accompanied compulsions. Being single and a student, positive family history of OCD and other mental disorders, presence of psychiatric comorbidity, and longer sleep latency were predictors of OCD. Early recognition and detection of these issues may help to intervene in OCD. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Zheng, Xiao, Xie, Wang and Wang.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Female employees are more sensitive to the perceived event strength of the novel coronavirus pneumonia than male employees (F = 10.94, p <0.001); Employees aged 30-40 affected by the epidemic have the highest level of emotional exhaustion (F = 5.22, p < 0.01); A higher education level leads to a higher level of emotional exhaustion (F = 4.74, p < 0.01); The emotional exhaustion is polarized with the annual family income (F = 4.099, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The novelty, disruption, criticality of the Corona Virus Disease event has had a positive impact on the emotional exhaustion of employees in the workplace; Emotional exhaustion plays a partly mediating role between event strength with constructive deviant behaviors, and destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a positive effect on creative constructive deviant behaviors, challenging constructive deviant behaviors, and interpersonal destructive deviant behaviors. Emotional exhaustion has a negative impact on organizational destructive deviant behaviors, and has no significant impact on interpersonal constructive deviant behaviors.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The prevalence and impact of migraine and severe headache in the United States: Updated age, sex, and socioeconomic-specific estimates from government health surveys. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate, up-to-date estimates of the burden of migraine and severe headache are important for evidence-based decision-making about workforce needs and the distribution of health resources. We used data from US government health surveys to report the prevalence, trends, and impact of this condition by age, sex, and poverty status., METHODS: We identified the most recent, publicly available summary statistics from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. We extracted and compiled relevant information from each study, with an emphasis on sex, age, and economic-related statistics., RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of migraine and severe headache in the United States has remained stable over many years. In 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence was 15.9% across all adults. The sex ratio also remains stable, with 21% of women and 10.7% of men affected. Migraine continues to be an important public health problem, accounting for roughly 4 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2016, when headache was the fifth most common reason for an ED visit overall and the third most common reason for ED visits in females 15-64. Migraine also accounted for over 4.3 million office visits. Many adults with migraine or severe headaches are disadvantaged. In 2018, for example, roughly 40% of US adults with migraine were unemployed, and a similar proportion were classified as poor or \"near poor.\" Roughly one in five had no health insurance and about a third had a high school education or less., CONCLUSIONS: Migraine and severe headaches are a serious public health issue in the United States, with the highest impact in women of childbearing age and those of lower socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic disadvantages also are highly prevalent among those with headaches. The economic consequences of the current coronavirus pandemic are likely to exacerbate all of these inequities. Increased attention to this high impact chronic pain condition, and improved funding for treatment provision and research, are warranted to reduce the future burden of disease.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, associated zoonotic concerns, and importance of the One Health approach during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has now affected over 72.5 million people worldwide, with nearly 1.6 million deaths reported globally as of December 17, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to have originated from bats and pangolins, and its intermediate animal hosts are being investigated. Crossing of the species barrier and exhibition of zoonosis have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 in farm (minks), domesticated (cats and dogs), and wild animals (tigers, puma, and lions). Recently, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in mink farms, which led to the death of a myriad minks. The clinical and pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rapid animal-to-animal transmission in minks are almost similar to the findings observed in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the rapid virus transmission among minks and the associated mutations resulted in a new mink-associated variant that was identified in both minks and humans, thereby providing evidence of mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The new mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a possible reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies poses serious risks and is expected to have a direct effect on the diagnostic techniques, therapeutics, and vaccines that are currently under development. This article highlights the current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, and provides an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in minks and the associated zoonotic concerns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from minks to humans with an emphasis on appropriate mitigation measures and on the necessity of adopting the One Health approach during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of Recommended Maternal Vaccination Programs on the Clinical Presentation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Prospective Observational Study. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the possible cross immunity resulting from common vaccination programs and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the Spanish Obstetric Emergency group performed a multicenter prospective study on the vaccination status of Influenza and Tdap (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine boost administered in adulthood) in consecutive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pregnancy cohort, in order to assess its possible association with the clinical presentation and severity of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as to determine the factors that may affect vaccination adherence. 1,150 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women from 78 Spanish hospitals were analyzed: 183 had not received either vaccine, 23 had been vaccinated for Influenza only, 529 for Tdap only and 415 received both vaccines. No association was observed between the vaccination status and the clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or the severity of symptoms. However, a lower adherence to the administration of both vaccines was observed in the Latin-American subgroup. Based on the results above, we reinforce the importance of maternal vaccination programs in the actual pandemic. Health education campaigns should be specially targeted to groups less likely to participate in these programs, as well as for a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Inhibition of the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells by the FDA-approved drug chlorpromazine. INTRODUCTION: Urgent action is needed to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), the prototype of typical antipsychotics from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and acts as an antiviral, in particular against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The aim of this in vitro study was to test CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monkey VeroE6 cells and human alveolar basal epithelial A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence of different concentrations of CPZ. Supernatants were harvested at day 2 and analysed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cell viability was assessed on non-infected cells., RESULTS: We evidenced an antiviral activity of CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey VeroE6 cells with an IC50 of 8.2 microM, a CC50 of 13.5microM and a SI of 1.65. In human A549-ACE2 cells, CPZ was also associated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with an IC50 of 11.3 microM, a CC50 of 23.1 microM and a SI of 2.04., DISCUSSION: Even though the measured SI are low, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine because of CPZ high biodistribution in lungs and in saliva. Also, CPZ brain distribution could be of high interest for treating or preventing the neurological and psychiatric forms of COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical findings support clinical investigation of the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.

Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines, and for assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at >= 6 months post-infection. IgG to the Spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month post symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.

{"text": "Monitoring COVID-19 Transmission Risks by Quantitative Real-Time PCR Tracing of Droplets in Hospital and Living Environments. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) environmental contamination occurs through droplets and biological fluids released in the surroundings from patients or asymptomatic carriers. Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swabs) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (three hospitals and three public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID hospital but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplet traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions, and fecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by qPCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment. IMPORTANCE Several studies have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Saliva and nasopharyngeal droplets can land on objects and surfaces, creating fomites. A suitable indicator would allow the detection of droplets or biofluids carrying the virus. Therefore, we searched for viral RNA and droplets and fomites on at risk surfaces. We monitored by qPCR or next generation sequencing (NGS) droplets through their microbiota. Although the study was performed during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly found on surfaces, with the only exception of environmental areas near infectious patients. Conversely, anthropic contamination was frequent, suggesting a role for biofluids as putative markers of indirect transmission and risk assessment. Moreover, all SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces showed droplets' microbiota. Fomite monitoring by qPCR may have an impact on public health strategies, supporting prevention of indirect transmission similarly to what is done for other communicable diseases (e.g., influenza and influenza-like infections).

OBJECTIVE: Investigate food insecurity (FI) prevalence in two favelas in Brazil in the early weeks of the social distancing policy, from 27 March 2020 to 1 June 2020., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire to elicit information on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, the types of stores visited to buy food, and FI screening. The FI experience was evaluated according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate or severe FI were investigated using the logistic regression model., SETTING: Sao Paulo city, Brazil., PARTICIPANTS: 909 householders., RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of the households included young women working as cleaners or kitchen assistants and in sales services. One-fifth of the participants were involved in the federal cash transfer programme, called Bolsa Familia. There were 92% households with children. The most frequent experience reported was uncertainty about food acquisition or receiving more (89%), eating less than one should (64%), not being able to eat healthy and nutritious food (46%), and skipping a meal (39%). Forty-seven percent of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI. Factors associated with moderate and severe FI were low income, being a Bolsa Familia recipient, having a low level of education, and living in a household without children., CONCLUSIONS: Half of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI, and almost 10% experienced hunger.

{"text": "Interplay between COVID-19, pollution, and weather features on changes in the incidence of acute coronary syndromes in early 2020. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented change in the apparent epidemiology of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area., METHODS AND RESULTS: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all p<0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (p<0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (p<0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (p<0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase.

{"text": "Double stranded RNA drives innate immune responses, sickness behavior and cognitive impairment dependent on dsRNA length, IFNAR1 expression and age. Double stranded RNA is generated during viral replication. The synthetic analog poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease including autism, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1 to 6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF alpha responses than poly I:C of less than 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFN beta nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFN beta binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1beta and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length, IFNAR1 and age-dependent effects on antiviral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "The impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns accounting for antibody-dependent enhancement. <h4>Background: </h4> COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched, and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and -- importantly -- some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% - 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Are Aspirin and Apixaban Sufficient to Prevent Immunothrombosis in COVID-19?. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with respiratory and vascular injury and microvascular immunothrombosis mediated by complement activation, inflammatory lipid storm, platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte adhesion and activation of coagulation cascade. Amongst the inflammatory lipids, thromboxane A2 (TxA2) is a known key mediator of microvascular thrombosis. The levels of TxB2, a stable metabolite of TxA2 are markedly increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma in severe COVID-19 patients. Low-dose aspirin mitigates the generation of prostanoids including TxA2 by irreversible inactivation of the constitutive enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. The anti-thrombotic action of aspirin is currently being investigated in outpatient and hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the global RECOVERY and ACTIV-4 clinical trials. Several lines of investigations suggest that COX-2 plays an important and critical role in the immunothrombotic effects mediated by COVID-19. Pharmacologic inhibition of either COX-1 or COX-2 can prevent a plethora of lipid mediators of inflammation that are both pro- and anti-inflammatory in function. Thus, a more definitive approach to prevent immunothrombotic events in COVID-19 will be to directly block the prothrombotic effects of TxA2. Although thromboxane synthase (TS) inhibitors suppress TxA2 formation, accumulation of the substrate PGH2 is known to interact with the platelet and vessel wall TxA2 prostanoid receptor (TPR), thus reducing the antiplatelet effects of TS inhibitors. TPR antagonists block the activity of both TxA2 and PGH2 on platelets and vessels but do not block TxA2 production, which leads to increased generation of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, a stable metabolite of TxA2, and a potent agonist of the DP2 (CRTH2) receptor for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). PGD2/DP2 receptor signaling has been implicated in immune dysregulation in viral infections including COVID-19. Ramatroban, an orally bioavailable, potent, dual TxA2/TP and PGD2/DP2 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in a variety of animal models of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and sepsis. Ramatroban has a proven safety profile, having been used in Japan over the past 20 years as a treatment of allergic rhinitis and therefore, merits investigation as a promising antithrombotic and immunomodulator agent for chemoprophylaxis and treatment in COVID-19 patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood., METHOD: We applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England., RESULTS: We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands)., CONCLUSION: This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.

{"text": "Hydroxychloroquine as a Chemoprophylactic Agent for COVID-19: A Clinico-Pharmacological Review. Hydroxychloroquine has gained much attention as one of the candidate drugs that can be repurposed as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high transmissibility and presence of asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic transmission, there is need for a chemoprophylactic agent to protect the high-risk population. In this review, we dissect the currently available evidence on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis from a clinical and pharmacological point of view. In vitro studies on Vero cells show that hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by affecting viral entry and viral transport via endolysosomes. However, this efficacy has failed to replicate in in vivo animal models as well as in most clinical observational studies and clinical trials assessing pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. An analysis of the pharmacology of HCQ in COVID-19 reveals certain possible reasons for this failure-a pharmacokinetic failure due to failure to achieve adequate drug concentration at the target site and attenuation of its inhibitory effect due to the presence of TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells. Currently, many clinical trials on HCQ prophylaxis in HCW are ongoing; these factors should be taken into account. Using higher doses of HCQ for prophylaxis is likely to be associated with increased safety concerns; thus, it may be worthwhile to focus on other possible interventions.

Survival of respiratory viral pathogens in expelled saliva microdroplets is central to their transmission, yet the factors that determine survival in such microdroplets are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH >= 57%. Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival.

Utilizing our proteomics dataset, we identified multiple drugs that could inhibit the upregulated proteins involved in disease pathogenesis of these 2 FDA-approved drugs Selinexor and Ponatinib, which showed promise of being re-purposed for potential therapeutics of COVID-19. Plasma proteome identified significant dysregulation in the pathways related to peptidase activity, regulated exocytosis, blood coagulation, complement activation, leukocyte activation involved in immune response, and response to glucocorticoid biological processes during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, the results suggest that COVID-19 severity can be prognosticated using specific biomarkers of severity, and few of these proteins are excellent targets for re-purposed drugs.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Host determinants of severe coronavirus disease 2019 include advanced age, comorbidities and male sex. Virologic factors may also be important in determining clinical outcome and transmission rates, but limited patient-level data is available. <br><br>Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study at seven public hospitals in Singapore. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between individuals infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. Firth\u2019s logistic regression was used to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and development of hypoxia, and quasi-Poisson regression to compare transmission rates. Plasma samples were tested for immune mediator levels and the kinetics of viral replication in cell culture were compared. <br><br>Findings: 319 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had clinical and virologic data available for analysis. 29 (9%) were infected with clade S, 90 (28%) with clade L/V, 96 (30%) with clade G (containing D614G variant), and 104 (33%) with other clades \u2018O\u2019 were assigned to lineage B.6. After adjusting for age and other covariates, infections with clade S (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0\u00b7030 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0\u00b70002-0\u00b729)) or clade O (B\u00b76) (aOR 0\u00b726 (95% CI 0\u00b7064-0\u00b793)) were associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen compared with clade L/V. Patients infected with clade L/V had more pronounced systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. No significant difference in the severity of clade G infections was observed (aOR 0\u00b795 (95% CI: 0\u00b735-2\u00b752). Though viral loads were significantly higher, there was no evidence of increased transmissibility of clade G, and replicative fitness in cell culture was similar for all clades. <br><br>Interpretation: Infection with clades L/V was associated with increased severity and more systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

While several studies suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role, the key mediators of this process are yet to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that plasma from a high proportion (77%) of critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not healthy controls, contains broadly auto-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM), and only infrequently auto-reactive IgG or IgA. Importantly, these auto-IgM preferentially recognize primary human lung cells in vitro, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, LDH-release assays, and analytical proteome microarray technology, we identified high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 263 candidate auto-antigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on cellular membranes in pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues. These findings suggest that broad IgM-mediated autoimmune reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, thereby identifying a potential target for novel therapeutic interventions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Telogen effluvium (TE), a common hair disease, is supposed to be related to stress, which could be secondary to poor sleep. We call attention to the current COVID-19 pandemic, that is leading to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and as a consequence, higher states of stress and anxiety, which are possible triggers for TE. In parallel, trichodynia is a sensorial symptom that is commonly related with hair diseases, including TE. We argue that substance P, a neuropeptide that has participation in the neuroinflammation and also in the sleep regulation, may play a possible role in this scalp paresthesia. We suggest that there may be an association between this substrate and sleep, which can aggravate trichodynia and TE.

OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in the residency experience early in the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate wellness measures among otolaryngology residents., METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to U.S. otolaryngology residents. Responses to the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale were recorded along with data on burnout, demographics, wellness, sleep, training, and education., RESULTS: 119 U.S. otolaryngology residents representing 27 of 42 states with otolaryngology residency programs responded to the survey. 24.4% (95% CI 17.0-31.8%) self-reported some level of burnout, while 10.9% met SMBM criteria for \"clinically relevant\" burnout. 51.3% experienced more stress, and 58.8% reported more anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to males, females had a higher prevalence of burnout (38.9% vs 12.3%, P = .001) and anxiety (75.9% vs 43.8%, P < .001). PGY-2s had a greater mean SMBM index (3.64) and higher rates of self-reported burnout (54.2%) than their counterparts at other levels of training. Residents reported less time spent in the hospital, lower surgical volume, and less procedural independence. Educational didactics, primarily via videoconference, were more frequent for 63.9% of respondents., CONCLUSION: While burnout among otolaryngology residents was low early in the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to separation from the workplace environment, trainees had higher levels of anxiety and stress. The surgical experience was negatively impacted by the pandemic, but remote didactics and educational opportunities increased. These findings may inform otolaryngology residency programs on the need to promote resident wellness and aid in devising strategies to improve the educational experience during this unique global health crisis as well as in the long term.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19: What Do Rheumatologists Need to Know?. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, rapidly reaching global pandemic proportions. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unique challenges to the rheumatology community. It is known that many individuals with rheumatic disease are at increased risk of severe disease from other infections, sparking a similar fear for COVID-19. In addition, medications routinely used in rheumatology practice are being trialled as treatments, with the potential for drug shortages for rheumatology patients., RECENT FINDINGS: Underlying comorbidities and active disease are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. Tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine have not proven to be effective treatments in the management of COVID-19. Telehealth has become an essential tool for the rheumatology community to monitor patients during the pandemic. In this article, we summarise the available COVID-19 evidence that is of relevance to the rheumatology community. We discuss the risk of contracting COVID-19 in individuals with rheumatic disease, along with presenting features and clinical outcomes. We provide an overview of the treatments for COVID-19 which have significance for rheumatology. We highlight published recommendations which can guide our management of rheumatic disease populations during this pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Chemokine levels in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been shown to be markedly elevated. But the role of chemokines in mild COVID-19 has not yet been established. According to the epidemiological statistics, most of the COVID-19 cases in Shiyan City, China, have been mild. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of chemokines in mild COVID-19 patients and explore the correlation between chemokines and host immune response., METHODS: In this study, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect serum levels of chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Shiyan City. Expression of chemokine receptors and of other signaling molecules was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: We first demonstrated that COVID-19 patients, both sever and mild cases, are characterized by higher level of chemokines. Specifically, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is expressed at higher levels both in severe and mild cases of COVID-19. The receptor of MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2, was expressed at higher levels in mild COVID-19 patients. Finally, we observed a significant negative correlation between expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and serum levels of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients., CONCLUSION: Higher expression of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of IFN signaling.

At the end of 2019, in Wuhan, the Hubei Province's capital city in China, the first cases of COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were described. The rapid spread of the infection through the world resulted in the World Health Organization announcing the COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. The main routes of transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to current evidence, are via droplets inhalation, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, and transmission via the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes, and probably through airborne particles from the respiratory tract, generated during coughing and sneezing of infected individuals. During the pulmonary function testing (PFTs), which require strenuous breathing maneuvers and generate high-intensity airflow, aerosols, and micro-aerosols are formed from respiratory secretions and may contain viral and bacterial particles. Therefore, such forced respiratory maneuvers pose a significant risk of spreading the infection to patients and laboratory staff. According to current knowledge, the source of infection may also be an asymptomatic and a pre-symptomatic individual. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly prevalent in the community, and this increases a potential risk to all patients tested lung function and staff working there. As the patients' and staff's safety is of unprecedented importance, the additional precautions when performing pulmonary function tests are necessary and unquestionable. In consequence, the greater availability of consumables and personal protective equipment is indispensable. The reorganization of daily practice will prolong test time, reduce the number of tests performed, and slow down patients' flow. The guidance provides practical advice to health care professionals on performing pulmonary function tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been developed basing on currently available information and recommendations from relevant health care institutions. As the COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and the new scientific data has been becoming are available, the guidance will be updated over time.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The recently emerged coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat affecting millions of people, causing respiratory system related problems that can end up with extremely serious consequences. As the infection rate rises significantly and this is followed by a dramatic increase in mortality, the whole world is struggling to accommodate change and is trying to adapt to new conditions. While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving. Hence, controlling the transmission of the virus is crucial. Therefore, this review summarizes the viability of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces under different conditions while addressing the current state of known chemical disinfectants for deactivation of the coronaviruses.

We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells targeting S1 and M proteins and measured RBD-specific serum IgG over a period of 2-6 months after symptoms onset in a cohort of subjects who had recovered from severe clinical forms of COVID-19. <h4>Methods</h4> We recruited 58 patients (38 males and 20 females; median age, 62.5 years), who had been hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia, 60% with one or more comorbidities. IgG antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69 + -expressing-IFN\u03b3-producing-CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were enumerated in heparinized whole blood by flow cytometry for ICS. <h4>Results</h4> Detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M-reactive CD69 + -IFN-\u03b3 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were displayed in 17 (29.3%) and 6 (10.3%) subjects respectively, at a median of 84 days after onset of symptoms (range, 58-191 days). Concurrent comorbidities increased the risk (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.03-9.61; P =0.04) of undetectable T-cell responses in models adjusted for age, sex and hospitalization ward. Twenty-one out of the 35 patients (60%) had detectable RBD-specific serum IgGs at a median of 118 days (range, 60 to 145 days) after symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG serum levels were found to drop significantly over time. <h4>Conclusion</h4> A relatively limited number of subjects who developed severe forms of COVID-19 had detectable SARS-CoV-2-S1/M IFN\u03b3 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at midterm after clinical diagnosis.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the deadly respiratory disease called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing global public health emergency that has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We review literature on the transmission and control of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the challenges of focusing on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as critical control measures in low-income countries. A significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related deaths has been reported for the United States of America and other high-income countries in Europe and Asia, regardless of advanced medical facilities in those countries. In contrast, much lower COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality rates have been documented in many low-income countries, despite having comparatively higher socioeconomic burdens and suboptimal medical facilities. By September 29, 2020 over one million deaths have been reported. On the same day, the cumulative total of COVID-19 related morbidity for Africa was 35,954 with 3.5% of the global COVID-19 related deaths.

Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2)/ CCL4-MIP-1\u03b2 .

Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells. <h4>Summary</h4> Immunologic Modeling of Severity and Chronicity of COVID-19", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

It focuses on the synergies among (i) vaccination , (ii) the supported isolation of contacts of confirmed cases and (iii) restrictions on contact rates (i.e., lockdown and social distancing). To model these mitigations, we used a dynamic causal model that embeds an epidemiological model into agent-based behavioural model. The model structure and parameters were optimised to best explain responses\u2014to the first and subsequent waves\u2014enabling predictions over the forthcoming year under counterfactual scenarios. Illustrative analyses suggest that the full potential of vaccination is realised by increasing the efficacy of contact tracing: for example, under idealised (best case) assumptions\u2014of an effective vaccine and efficient isolation of infected pre-symptomatic cases\u2014 suppression of community transmission would require 50% herd immunity by vaccinating 22% by the end of 2021; i.e., 15 million people or about 50,000 per day. With no change in the isolation of contacts, 36% would require vaccination, i.e., 25 million people. These figures should not be read as estimates of the actual number of people requiring vaccination; however, they illustrate the potential of this kind of model to quantify interactions among public health interventions. We anticipate using this model in a few months\u2014to estimate the average effectiveness of vaccines when more data become available.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Ethics committees in the time of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: ethics committees (ECs) protect the rights, safety, and well-being of research participants and ensure the scientific correctness of clinical research. COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs., OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown., DESIGN: cross-sectional survey., SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19., RESULTS: 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety., CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with severe asthma on biologic therapy. BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether asthma and asthma medications increase or decrease the risk of severe COVID-19, and this is particularly true for patients with severe asthma receiving biologics., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess incidence and disease course of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma on biologic therapy (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab), as compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population., METHODS: COVID-19 cases were identified through a prospective ongoing survey between March 17 and April 30, 2020 among all severe asthma specialists from 15 hospitals of the Dutch Severe Asthma Registry RAPSODI. From these cases, data was collected on patient characteristics, including co-morbidities, COVID-19 disease progression and asthma exacerbations. Findings were then compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population., RESULTS: Of 634 severe asthma patients who received biologic therapy in RAPSODI, 9 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Seven patients (1.1%) required hospitalization for oxygen therapy, of which 5 were admitted to the intensive care for intubation and mechanical ventilation. One patient died (0.16%). All intubated patients had >=1 co-morbidities. Odds (95%CI) for COVID-19 related hospitalization and intubations were 14 (6.6-29.5) and 41 (16.9-98.5) times higher, respectively, compared to the Dutch population. One patient presented with an asthma exacerbation., CONCLUSION: Patients with severe asthma using biologic therapy showed to have a more severe course of COVID-19 compared to the general population. This may be due to co-morbidities, the severity of asthmatic airway inflammation, the use of biologics, or a combination of these. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

{"text": "Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical trials and observational studies have investigated various pharmacological agents as potential treatment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the results are heterogeneous and sometimes even contradictory to one another, making it difficult for clinicians to determine which treatments are truly effective., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We carried out a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to systematically evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions and the level of evidence behind each treatment regimen in different clinical settings. Both published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and confounding-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria were collected. We included studies investigating the effect of pharmacological management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 management. Mild patients who do not require hospitalization or have self-limiting disease courses were not eligible for our NMA. A total of 110 studies (40 RCTs and 70 observational studies) were included. PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from the beginning of 2020 to August 24, 2020. Studies from Asia (41 countries, 37.2%), Europe (28 countries, 25.4%), North America (24 countries, 21.8%), South America (5 countries, 4.5%), and Middle East (6 countries, 5.4%), and additional 6 multinational studies (5.4%) were included in our analyses. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mechanical ventilation), viral clearance rate, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and noncardiac serious adverse events. Based on RCTs, the risk of progression to severe course and mortality was significantly reduced with corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.86, p = 0.032, and OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91, p = 0.002, respectively) and remdesivir (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.50, p < 0.001, and OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98, p = 0.041, respectively) compared to standard care for moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in non-ICU; corticosteroids were also shown to reduce mortality rate (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73, p < 0.001) for critically ill patients in ICU. In analyses including observational studies, interferon-alpha (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.004), itolizumab (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92, p = 0.042), sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88, p = 0.030), anakinra (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.82, p = 0.019), tocilizumab (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.60, p < 0.001), and convalescent plasma (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.96, p = 0.038) were associated with reduced mortality rate in non-ICU setting, while high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49, p = 0.003), ivermectin (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, p = 0.005), and tocilizumab (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90, p = 0.012) were associated with reduced mortality rate in critically ill patients. Convalescent plasma was the only treatment option that was associated with improved viral clearance rate at 2 weeks compared to standard care (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, p < 0.001). The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.20, p = 0.003) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.00, p = 0.007). No drug was significantly associated with increased noncardiac serious adverse events compared to standard care. The quality of evidence of collective outcomes were estimated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The major limitation of the present study is the overall low level of evidence that reduces the certainty of recommendations. Besides, the risk of bias (RoB) measured by RoB2 and ROBINS-I framework for individual studies was generally low to moderate. The outcomes deducted from observational studies could not infer causality and can only imply associations. The study protocol is publicly available on PROSPERO (CRD42020186527)., CONCLUSIONS: In this NMA, we found that anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG), convalescent plasma, and remdesivir were associated with improved outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hydroxychloroquine did not provide clinical benefits while posing cardiac safety risks when combined with azithromycin, especially in the vulnerable population. Only 29% of current evidence on pharmacological management of COVID-19 is supported by moderate or high certainty and can be translated to practice and policy; the remaining 71% are of low or very low certainty and warrant further studies to establish firm conclusions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily known as a respiratory illness; however, a wide variety of symptoms and complications of the central nervous system (CNS), such as ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) have been reported. Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with CVA to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high., CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.

{"text": "Long-term application of hydroxychloroquine could not prevent the infection of COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: Current pandemic of the coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an urgent issue to the world due to lack of vaccine and medication. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has generated a lot of controversies whether it is effective in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Current report presents a 63-year-old woman who has taken HCQ for many years but still infected by COVID-19., CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with rheumatoid arthritis came to the clinic with fever and sore throat. The patient has been treated with 200 mg HCQ per day since 2016. Laboratory tests showed that the patient had lymphopenia, increased levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Chest radiography showed that the patient had pneumonia. Throat swab test confirmed COVID-19 positive. On admission, she was treated with nebulized interferon alfa-2b, oral Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and ceftriaxone sodium for the COVID-19 in addition to HCQ. The patient stayed in hospital for 18 days, recovered from oxygen intake, and eventually discharged from hospital. Follow up investigation showed the patient developed antibody against COVID-19., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term application of HCQ could not prevent COVID-19 infection, but whether HCQ exerts benefit to alleviation of clinical symptoms and duration of hospital stays remains to be further investigated.

Brazil has been particularly impacted, registering more than 1.3 million infections and 57,000 deaths by late June 2020. Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis.

{"text": "Crystal gazing: Myth or reality for critical care for covid-19 patients?. Efforts are continuing worldwide to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatments for COVID-19. However, at the moment treatment remains supportive with oxygen therapy, steroids, repurposed antivirals, and prevention of multiple organ dysfunction by using immunomodulators. COVID-19 remains challenging since the disease spectrum varies from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high fatality rates. It is thus necessary to predict clinical outcomes and risk-stratify patients for ensuring early intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. An important aspect is building surge capacity, managing and optimizing therapeutic and operational resources. So far, data have been scarce, particularly from India, to identify predictors of poor outcomes and mortality early in the course of the disease. Risk models need to be developed in larger patient cohorts and the models need to be simple and easy to employ at the onset of the disease process to predict the risk of severe disease, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay (LOS), and mortality.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Role of sociometry in determining the spread of Covid-19 cases amidst lockdown strategies. India implemented nationwide lockdown to control COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. Despite lockdown for 100 days, the incidence of covid-19 does not seem to abate. Lockdown induced productivity loss caused severe economic stress. In any pandemic, initial lockdown is necessary for every country to ensure preparedness and public awareness. India erred in prolonging the initial spell of lockdown. During lockdown infected person will spend more time with family members and neighbours thereby infecting all with increase in k-value. In the absence of lockdown they may not find so much spare time to spend with his/her family or to visit neighbours with decrease in k-value. Although lockdown in India has reduced the rapidity of spread by bringing down R0to 1.27, it was achieved at the cost of prolonging the duration of the epidemic. In the absence of adequate herd immunity, lockdown may flatten the curve but area under the curve (AUC) will remain unaltered. The idea of lifting the lockdown with an aim of developing herd immunity in 60% of the younger population appears to be promising.

{"text": "Rethinking cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines for cardiac arrest in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 has modified our approach to resuscitation and underscored the importance of staff protection. The aim of this editorial is to review the published literature on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients with COVID-19 and to outline the changes that have been made to our institutional protocol for cardiopulmonary resuscitation following cardiac arrest in suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) was first identified in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China in December 2019, which has brought normal life to a halt throughout the world1. COVID-19 symptoms range from mild respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure2,3. The high transmissibility of this virus coupled with asymptomatic infections initially prevented effective containment of the disease in Wuhan, leading to the spread of infection to other parts of China and subsequently to the rest of the world. The current global statistics of the pandemic show that over 11 million people have been infected and there have been 500,000 deaths worldwide as of 5 July 20204. Measures adopted to control the spread of the virus were extensive testing, rapid isolation of cases, meticulous contact tracing, use of mobile phone applications for tracking cases, multilingual public awareness campaigns, and effective social distancing. This enabled a flattening of the curve of the epidemic without imposing a full lockdown. The overriding concern at that initial stage was the effect of unlimited and uncontrollable demand for ventilated ICU beds. Therefore, in preparation for an unpredictable increase in the number of cases, two field hospitals with nearly 9,000 beds and over 250 new ICU beds were rapidly established in the Kingdom. As of 5 July 2020, Bahrain has reported a total number of less than 30,000 confirmed cases of which around 25,000 have recovered and 96 have died4.

Thirty male albino rats weighing \"190-200 g\" were divided randomly into three groups (10 each): control, MA-induced OA, and MA-induced OA + dpdo. In MA-induced OA rat, the tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, reactive oxygen species, as well as all the mitochondrial markers such as mitochondria membrane potential, swelling mitochondria, cytochromecoxidase (complex IV), and serum oxidative/antioxidant status (malondialdehyde level and activities of myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase) are elevated. Also, the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), levels of ATP, the level of glutathione (GSH), and thiol were markedly diminished in the MA-induced OA group compared to the normal control rats. These findings showed that mitochondrial function is associated with OA pathophysiological alterations and high gene expressions of (IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b) and suggests a promising use of dpdo as potential ameliorative agents in the animal model of OA and could act as anti-inflammatory agent in case of severe infection with COVID-19. It is clearly appeared in improving the bone cortex and bone marrow in the treated group with the novel compound in histological and transmission electron microscopic sections which is a very important issue today in fighting severe infections that have significant effects on the blood indices and declining of blood corpuscles like COVID-19, in addition to declining the genotoxicity and inflammation induced by MA in male rats.

Introduction: COVID-19 has spread all around the world with huge toll of human lives and suffering since it evolved in China. Nepal had slow rise in morbidity due to COVID 19 in early days but has been gripped by the pandemic's exponential growth lately. This study was conducted with the aim to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of Nepali children in early phase of the pandemic. Method(s): This was an observational study conducted at 11 COVID care centres designated by the Government of Nepal with availability of supervision by paediatricians between January and August 2020 in children under 18 years of age diagnosed with COVID 19. Data was collected based on definitions outlined in data collection resources available at WHO-ISARIC Global COVID-19 clinical resources platform and analysed. Result(s): One hundred and twenty one children diagnosed with COVID 19 who presented to the designated centres were enrolled. Majority of children (83.4%) were identified as a part of contact tracing, 28.1% had an identified contact to a person with COVID 19 prior to their diagnosis and 20.7% had another household member diagnosed with COVID 19. The mean age of admitted children was 8.8 years (SD 5.6 years) with the largest proportion being adolescents (40.5%). Male (58.7%) children were more commonly affected. There were 15 (12.4%) infants and 8 (6%) of them were under two months of age. Most children (87, 71.9%) were asymptomatic, 21 (22.3%) had mild symptoms and six (4.9%) had moderately severe symptoms. Fever (18.2%) was the most commonly reported symptom. All children were discharged after a median of 14 days of hospitalisation. Conclusion(s): Nepali children of all ages are affected by COVID 19 and present with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection. Fever and respiratory symptoms are the most commonly reported symptoms. Most children do not develop complications. Continued surveillance in larger population of children as the pandemic unfolds will generate more stringent observations.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Nepal Paediatric Society (NEPAS).

BACKGROUND: To date, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, which is a pandemic disease, caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. In Togo, where four in five people practice self-medication, the absence of a cure for COVID-19 and the constant progression of the disease requires an assessment of self-medication patterns in the context of the pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 and its associated factors in Lome, Togo., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lome, the capital city of Togo, from April 23rd to May 8th, 2020, with a sample of participants from five sectors: the healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal sectors. The participants were invited to provide information about their self-medication practices to prevent COVID-19 in the 2 weeks preceding the survey., RESULTS: A total of 955 participants (71.6% men) with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included. Approximately 22.1% were in the air transport sector, 20.5% were in the police sector, and 38.7% were in the health sector. The overall prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 was 34.2% (95% CI: 31.2-37.3%). The most commonly used products were vitamin C (27.6%) and traditional medicine (10.2%). Only 2.0% of participants reported using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.

{"text": "Estimation of COVID-19 risk-stratified epidemiological parameters and policy implications for Los Angeles County through an integrated risk and stochastic epidemiological model. Background: Health disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations., Methods: We develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020., Findings: We estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR( t ) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR( t ) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits., Interpretation: The risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

AIM: To assess the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute coronary syndromes and on the delay from symptom onset to first medical contact among patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as well as to investigate whether there were patient-related reasons related to COVID-19 for delaying first medical contact., METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the Geneva University Hospitals for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) during the first COVID-19 wave were compared with a control group consisting of all ACS patients who underwent PCI during the same period in 2019 and those treated in the period immediately preceding the pandemic. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the delay from symptom onset to first medical contact in the setting of STEMI between the COVID-19 period and the control period. Secondary outcome measures were the difference in ACS incidence and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients&rsquo; decisions to call the emergency services, assessed using a questionnaire. Delay from symptom onset to first medical contact was longer among patients suffering from STEMI in the COVID-19 period compared with the control period (112 min vs 60 min, p = 0.049). The incidence rate of ACS was lower during the COVID-19 period (incidence rate ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.449&ndash;0.905). ACS patients delayed their call to the emergency services mainly because of fear of contracting or spreading COVID-19 following hospital admission, as well as of adding burden to the healthcare system., CONCLUSION: We observed prolonged delays from symptom onset to first medical contact and a decline in overall ACS incidence during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a higher threshold to call for help among ACS patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cycle threshold (Ct) has been suggested as an approximate measure of initial viral burden. The utility of cycle threshold, at admission, as a predictor of disease severity has not been thoroughly investigated., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study of SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3/26/2020 to 8/5/2020 who had SARS-CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n = 1044). Only patients with complete survival data, discharged (n = 774) or died in hospital (n = 270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct was analyzed as continuous variable and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate its relationship with outcome. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. Mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD = 5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD = 6.0, P<0.001). In-hospital mortality significantly differed (p<0.05) by Ct quartile. After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, hypertension and diabetes, increased cycle threshold was associated with decreased odds of in-hospital mortality (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001). Compared to the 4th Quartile, patients with Ct values in the 1st Quartile (Ct <22.9) and 2nd Quartile (Ct 23.0-27.3) had an adjusted odds ratio of in-hospital mortality of 3.8 and 2.6 respectively (p<0.001). The discriminative ability of Ct to predict inpatient mortality was found to be limited, possessing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (CI 0.63-0.71)., CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 Ct was found to be an independent predictor of patient mortality.

{"text": "Independent Role of Severe Obesity as a Risk Factor for COVID-19 Hospitalization: A Spanish Population-Based Cohort Study. Objectives: This study analyzed the association between severe obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and severe disease. Method(s): The incidence of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was evaluated in a prospective population-based cohort of 433,995 persons aged 25 to 79 years in Spain during March and April of 2020. Persons with and without class 3 obesity were compared using Poisson regression to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) from class 3 obesity of COVID-19 hospitalization and of severe disease (intensive care unit admission or death). Differences in the effect by age, sex, and chronic conditions were evaluated. Result(s): Individuals with class 3 obesity had a higher risk of hospitalization (aRR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.66-2.93) and developing severe COVID-19 (aRR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.20-4.40). In people younger than 50 years, these effects were more pronounced (aRR = 5.02, 95% CI: 3.19-7.90 and aRR = 13.80, 95% CI: 3.11-61.17, respectively), whereas no significant effects were observed in those aged 65 to 79 years (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.70-2.12 and aRR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.88, respectively). Sex and chronic conditions did not modify the effect of class 3 obesity in any of the outcomes. Conclusion(s): Severe obesity is a relevant risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in young adults, having a magnitude similar to that of aging.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportions of asymptomatic, mild and severe diseases in infected pregnant women admitted for delivery. To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients., STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center., RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones.

{"text": "COVID-19 and cancer: From basic mechanisms to vaccine development using nanotechnology. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic which has induced unprecedented ramifications, severely affecting our society due to the long incubation time, unpredictably high prevalence and lack of effective vaccines. One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options.

{"text": "New onset ascites, abdominal pain, and eosinophilia in a patient treated with nivolumab for poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) acting on PD-1, is an effective treatment for many malignancies. The augmentation of T cell immunity leads to its therapeutic effect, yet commonly causes immune-related adverse effects (irAE). ICI-induced diarrhea is frequently reported, while other gastrointestinal irAE are less well described. Here, we report a case of nivolumab-induced eosinophilia, ascites, and abdominal pain. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 58-year-old man with a history of tobacco use and stage IIB lung adenocarcinoma status post partial lobectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy (platinum/pemetrexed), and nivolumab was admitted with 1 month of diffuse abdominal pain and distention, dyspnea, fatigue, and intermittent low-grade fevers. He had received 11 cycles of nivolumab over 9 months, but it was stopped 3 months before admission due to eosinophilia. On admission, temperature was 99.4 and he had mild sinus tachycardia. Initial labs were notable for WBC 22.6 (3.5% bands), absolute eosinophil count 1605 (peak 4563), and platelets 800. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed hepatomegaly, new ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions. Paracentesis indicated inflammatory ascites (serum ascites albumin gradient 0.5). Infectious work-up was negative, including COVID-19 testing. ECHO showed normal cardiac function and small pericardial effusion. He received empiric antibiotics without improvement. EGD revealed mild diffuse duodenal lymphangiectasia. Duodenal biopsies showed patchy villous blunting with inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils within the lamina propria. After extensive work-up and multidisciplinary consultation, nivolumab-induced eosinophilia with serositis was diagnosed. Empiric high dose steroids (solumedrol) and ivermectin/ albendazole were given, though parasitic infection deemed unlikely. After symptoms improved, he was discharged on a prednisone taper. DISCUSSION: In this patient presenting with a constellation of symptoms, nivolumab-associated eosinophilia with serositis was the unifying diagnosis, causing the atypical GI symptoms of new ascites and abdominal pain. While rare, eosinophilia has been reported with ICI use (1). Thus, irAE must be considered in a patient with new GI symptoms after ICI therapy, as treatment with steroids and/or biologics may be indicated.

The aim of the study was to examine post-traumatic stress reactions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of symptom-defined post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and factors associated with post-traumatic stress in the Norwegian population during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. A survey was administered via social media channels, to which a sample of 4527 adults (>=18 years) responded. Symptom-defined PTSD was measured with the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5. The items were specifically linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the DSM-5 diagnostic guidelines to categorize participants as fulfilling the PTSD symptom criteria or not. Associations with PTSD were examined with single and multiple logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of symptom-defined PTSD was 12.5% for men and 19.5% for women. PTSD was associated with lower age, female gender, lack of social support, and a range of pandemic-related variables such as economic concerns, expecting economic loss, having been in quarantine or isolation, being at high risk for complications from COVID-19 infection, and having concern for family and close friends. In conclusion, post-traumatic stress reactions appear to be common in the Norwegian population in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

{"text": "Factors That Might Affect SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Foreign-Born and U.S.-Born Poultry Facility Workers - Maryland, May 2020. Numerous recent assessments indicate that meat and poultry processing facility workers are at increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1-4). Physical proximity to other workers and shared equipment can facilitate disease transmission in these settings (2-4). The disproportionate number of foreign-born workers employed in meat and poultry processing reflects structural, social, and economic inequities that likely contribute to an increased COVID-19 incidence in this population* (5). In May 2020, the Maryland Department of Health and CDC investigated factors that might affect person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons who worked at two poultry processing facilities.  A survey administered to 359 workers identified differences in risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between workers born outside the United States and U.S.-born workers. Compared with U.S.-born workers, foreign-born workers had higher odds of working in fixed locations on the production floor (odds ratio [OR] for cutup and packaging jobs = 4.8), of having shared commutes (OR = 1.9), and of living with other poultry workers (OR = 6.0). They had lower odds of participating in social gatherings (OR for visits to family = 0.2; OR for visits to friends = 0.4), and they visited fewer businesses in the week before the survey than did their U.S.-born coworkers. Some workplace risk factors can be mitigated through engineering and administrative controls focused on the production floor, and this will be of particular benefit to the foreign-born workers concentrated in these areas. Employers and health departments can also partner with local organizations to disseminate culturally and linguistically tailored messages about risk reduction behaviors in community settings, including shared transportation and household members dwelling in close quarters.P.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Modeling and analysis of different scenarios for the spread of COVID-19 by using the modified multi-agent systems - Evidence from the selected countries. Currently, there is a global pandemic of COVID-19. To assess its prevalence, it is necessary to have adequate models that allow real-time modeling of the impact of various quarantine measures by the state. The SIR model, which is implemented using a multi-agent system based on mobile cellular automata, was improved. The paper suggests ways to improve the rules of the interaction and behavior of agents. Methods of comparing the parameters of the SIR model with real geographical, social and medical indicators have been developed. That allows the modeling of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 as a single location and as the whole country consisting of individual regions that interact with each other by transport, taking into account factors such as public transport, supermarkets, schools, universities, gyms, churches, parks. The developed model also allows us to assess the impact of quarantine, restrictions on transport connections between regions, to take into account such factors as the incubation period, the mask regime, maintaining a safe distance between people, and so on. A number of experiments were conducted in the work, which made it possible to assess both the impact of individual measures to stop the pandemic and their comprehensive application. A method of comparing computer-time and dynamic parameters of the model with real data is proposed, which allowed assessing the effectiveness of the government in stopping the pandemic in the Chernivtsi region, Ukraine.

{"text": "Gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients in the United States. INTRODUCTION: Although the typical presentation of COVID-19 infection includes fever and respiratory complaints, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are also common at the time of diagnosis. Case-series mainly from eastern Asia have reported varying frequency of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Given the regional variations in manifestation of disease, we sought to analyze the prevalence and characterization of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in the northeastern region of the United States. METHOD(S): We identified and analyzed all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at our institution between January and March of 2020. Those patients who were hospitalized and confirmed to have COVID-19 infection served as the cases. Patients during the same time period who tested negative for COVID-19 served as controls. Detailed information, including patient demographics, presenting complaints, diagnostic testing, hospital course, and outcomes, was collected. We categorized GI symptoms to include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, red blood per rectum, melena, loss of appetite, and loss of taste. RESULT(S): Out of 307 hospitalized patients who were tested for COVID-19 at our institution, 139 patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and 131 patients tested negative for COVID-19. The remaining 37 patients were excluded due to inconclusive or incomplete results. Diarrhea (25.2%, OR = 2.4) and loss of appetite (25.9%, OR = 3.2) were the most common GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and both were significantly more common when compared to the patients in the control group [Table 1]. Other GI symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were present in 10-20% of COVID-19 patients. Isolated gastrointestinal symptoms without the presence of respiratory symptoms occurred in 7.2% of COVID-19 patients at time of diagnosis. New-onset GI symptoms after admission were noted in 17.4% of COVID-19 patients. There was no significant association between the presence of GI symptoms and disease severity. CONCLUSION(S): Diarrhea and loss of appetite were the most common presenting GI symptoms in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection when compared to the control group. About 7% of COVID-19 positive patients presented with isolated GI symptoms alone. New-onset of GI symptoms developed during admission in 17% of COVID-19 patients.

Materials and Methods A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I2 = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I2 = 0.94), respectively. PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography. DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE. D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 mug/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT. The cutoffs of D-dimer levels used to exclude PE in preexisting guidelines seem applicable to patients with COVID-19. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

We describe a case series of two patients with COVID-19 infection who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and COVID-19 associated acute pancreatitis. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: CASE 1 An 18-year-old hispanic male presented to the hospital with acute onset of epigastric pain and vomiting. Blood tests on admission: leukocytosis 10.6K, lymphopenia 5.2%, and elevated lipase of 9916 unit/L. A CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed enlargement of the pancreas with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute interstitial pancreatitis. He had persistent fevers with negative septic work up but confirmed COVID-19 infection. Other causes of acute pancreatitis were ruled out. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 related pancreatitis, and on a follow-up outpatient he had resolution of pancreatitis. CASE 2 A 66-year-old white male presented to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Laboratory tests on admission showed lymphopenia and elevated D-dimer of 287 ng/ml. CT scan of the chest showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities (Figure 1). COVID-19 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs testing were negative four times. However, a stool sample was positive for COVID-19 RT-PCR. He clinically improved and was discharged home. Unfortunately, he was readmitted for abdominal pain and obstipation. His abdomen was distended with diffuse tenderness. Laboratory studies showed an elevated lipase of 9542 unit/L and amylase of 796 unit/L. Abdominal x-ray showed distended loops of bowels, suggesting ileus (Figure 2). Ultrasound of the abdomen showed ascites and non obstructive IVC thrombus. A CT scan of the pancreas showed diffuse peripancreatic edema, consistent with acute pancreatitis (Figure 3). He was started on therapeutic Lovenox, tolerated diet and was discharged home. DISCUSSION: COVID-19, is a novel virus that has caused a pandemic since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although respiratory symptoms are common presenting symptoms, more recent literature described patients presenting with GI symptoms. However, patients rarely can develop COVID-19 associated pancreatitis. Pancreatic injury can manifest as a spectrum ranging from an asymptomatic elevation of amylase and lipase to severe acute pancreatitis. Theories including cytokine response and susceptibility to ACE-2 receptor for COVID-19 have been proposed as possible mechanisms for acute pancreatitis (Figure Presnted).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Pediatric Ischemic Stroke: An Infrequent Complication of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: Severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of pediatric strokes with SARS-CoV-2 in the first three months of the pandemic in an international cohort., METHODS: We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (<=18 years) SARS-CoV-2 patients; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric stroke patients; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 March 1-May 31, 2020., RESULTS: Of 42 centers with SAR-CoV-2 hospitalization numbers, 8/971 (0.82%) with SARS-CoV-2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March-May 2020 were: 1/108 neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0/33 neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6/166 childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1/54 childhood CSVT (1.9%) cases. However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9%, 0%, 6.1%, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS-CoV-2. Seven of eight with SARS-CoV-2 had additional established stroke risk factors., INTERPRETATION: As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 4.7% of pediatric ischemic stroke patients tested. However, <50% of strokes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered in pediatric stroke patients as the pandemic continues to determine SARS-CoV-2's role in pediatric stroke.

{"text": "Hepatotoxicity of remdesivir for COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue drug that inhibits RNA polymerases. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has been shown to inhibit COVID-19. The gastrointestinal side effects of remdesivir, especially hepatotoxicity, are concerning but unknown. Our study was aim to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of Remdesivir for COVID-19. METHOD(S): MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched up to 6/1/2020. The following keywords were used in combination: Remdesivir, COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. Observational studies and clinical trials that utilized remdesivir for = day or 10 days among laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 and radiologically confirmed pneumonia patients were included. Given low incidences of side effects, studies that enrolled less than 100 patients were excluded. RESULT(S): Total 396 literatures were searched and three clinical trials with 1,697 patients were included. Patients were aged more than 18 years old with median or mean age more than 55 in three studies. 63% were male. The pooled incidence rate for bilirubin elevation was 4% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI 1%-26%, I2 94.6%). The rate for grade 3 or 4 bilirubin elevation was 1%(95% CI 0-2%, I2 0.0%). There is no significant difference on the change of bilirubin between the remdesivir group and placebo group with pooled Odd Ratio (OR) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.48-1.94, I2 0.0%). The rate for AST and ALT elevation were 4% (95%CI3%-7%, I2 59.6%) and3%(95%CI1%-13%, I2 91.8%) respectively. Thereported rates for grade 3 or 4AST elevation were 0%(95%CI 0-2%) byWang et. and 3%(95%CI 2%-5%) by Goldman et. There is no significant difference on the change of AST between the remdesivir group and placebo group with pooled Odd Ratio (OR) of 0.60 (95% CI 0.34-1.06, I2 21.5%). The pooled rate for hypoalbuminemia was 13%(95%CI 9%-20%, I2 95.8%). TheORfor hypoalbuminemia was 0.80 (95%CI 0.41-1.58, I2 0.0%).No acute liver failure was reported in all included studies. The reported rates of hepatotoxicity leading to drug discontinuation was 1% byWang et. CONCLUSION(S): The incidence of hepatotoxicity of remdesivir is not as high as previous studies reported, which were mostly transient and tolerable during the remdesivir treatment. The elevation of liver enzymes could be associated with underlying COVID related hepatal injury. However, more quality studies are needed to confirm the safety of the remdesivir.

Aim: Most of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have respiratory symptoms; however, various neurological symptoms, such as headache, can be seen. The pathophysiological mechanism of headache in COVID-19 is unknown completely. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between headache and inflammatory markers and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred and three hospitalized patients with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 15 March and 01 June 2020 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 62 patients with headache symptoms (n=31) and without headache symptoms (n=31), who were age and gender-matched, were included in the study. The demographic characteristics, inflammatory serum parameters, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio (CAR), hospitalization times, and disease severity were determined. Result(s): Of the 203 COVID-19 patients, 36 (17.7%) had a headache, and it was the fourth most common symptom. Headache accompanied other symptoms in all patients. Of the patients with headache, 14 (45.2%) were female, 17 (54.8%) were male, and the mean age was 37.74+/-16.65 years. In our COVID-19 patients, the neutrophil count, NLR, CRP, CAR were significantly higher, and hospital stay was longer in patients with headache than those without headache (p=0.023, p=0.041, p=0.034, p=0,048 and p=0.049, respectively). Conclusion(s): As a result, the increased inflammatory response may play a role in the pathogenesis of headache in COVID-19 patients.

BACKGROUND: Thrombotic complications of COVID-19 infection have become increasingly apparent as the disease has infected a growing number of individuals. Although less common than upper respiratory symptoms, thrombotic complications are not infrequent and may result in severe and long-term sequelae. Common thrombotic complications include pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, or venous thromboembolism; less commonly seen are acute myocardial injury, renal artery thrombosis, and mesenteric ischemia. Several case reports and case series have described acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 characterized by elevations in serum biomarkers., CASE REPORT: Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with acute coronary syndrome confirmed on catheter angiography and cardiac MRI. This patient was found to additionally have a left ventricular thrombus and ultimately suffered an acute cerebral infarction. Recognition of thrombotic complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection is essential for initiating appropriate therapy., CONCLUSIONS: In acute myocardial injury, given the different treatment strategies for myocarditis versus acute myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery thrombus, imaging can play a key role in clinical decision making for patients.

{"text": "On the distribution of hydrophilic polyelectrolytes and their counterions around zwitterionic micelles: the possible impact on the charge density in solution. Despite their charge neutrality, micelles composed of surfactants with zwitterionic headgroups selectively accumulate anions at their hydrophobic core/solution interphase due to electrostatic interactions if headgroup positive moieties are the innermost. This tendency may be markedly enhanced if polyions substitute simple ions. To investigate this possibility, solutions composed of zwitterionic micelles and hydrophilic polyanions have been investigated with Monte Carlo simulations representing the studied systems via primitive electrolyte models. Structural and energetic properties are obtained to highlight the impact of connecting simple ions into polyions on the interactions between electrolytes and micelles. Despite the latter, polyanions conserve their conformational properties. A marked increase in the concentration of charged species inside the micellar corona is, instead, found when polyions are present independently of their charge sign or the headgroup structure. Thus, polyelectrolytes act as \"shuttle\" for all charged species, with the potential of increasing reactions rates involving the latter due to mass effects. Besides, results for the polyions/micelles mixing free energy and Helmholtz energy profiles indicate that the critical micelle concentration is impacted minimally by hydrophilic polyelectrolytes, an outcome agreeing with experiments. This finding is entirely due to weak enthalpic effects while mixing hydrophilic polyions and micelles. A strong reduction in the screening of the micelle negative charge, acquired following the adsorption of anions in the corona and due to counterions layering just outside it (the so called \"chameleon effect\"), is forecasted when polyanions substitute monovalent anions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Virulence and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques: A nonhuman primate model of COVID-19 progression. The COVID-19 has emerged as an epidemic, causing severe pneumonia with a high infection rate globally. To better understand the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2, we developed a rhesus macaque model to mimic natural infection via the nasal route, resulting in the SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in the nose and stool up to 27 days. Importantly, we observed the pathological progression of marked interstitial pneumonia in the infected animals on 5-7 dpi, with virus dissemination widely occurring in the lower respiratory tract and lymph nodes, and viral RNA was consistently detected from 5 to 21 dpi. During the infection period, the kinetics response of T cells was revealed to contribute to COVID-19 progression. Our findings implied that the antiviral response of T cells was suppressed after 3 days post infection, which might be related to increases in the Treg cell population in PBMCs. Moreover, two waves of the enhanced production of cytokines (TGF-alpha, IL-4, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL- 10, IL-15, IL-1beta), chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, and MIP-1beta/CCL4) were detected in lung tissue. Our data collected from this model suggested that T cell response and cytokine/chemokine changes in lung should be considered as evaluation parameters for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine development, besides of observation of virus shedding and pathological analysis.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Zheng et al.

{"text": "Chronic kidney disease is a key risk factor for severe COVID-19: a call to action by the ERA-EDTA. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease have been listed as risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the first report of the disease in January 2020. However, this report did not mention chronic kidney disease (CKD) nor did it provide information on the relevance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria. As the disease spread across the globe, information on larger populations with greater granularity on risk factors emerged. The recently published OpenSAFELY project analysed factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients. The picture that arose differs significantly from initial reports. For example, hypertension is not an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.89], but renal disease very much is. Dialysis (aHR 3.69), organ transplantation (aHR 3.53) and CKD (aHR 2.52 for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) represent three of the four comorbidities associated with the highest mortality risk from COVID-19. The risk associated with CKD Stages 4 and 5 is higher than the risk associated with diabetes mellitus (aHR range 1.31-1.95, depending upon glycaemic control) or chronic heart disease (aHR 1.17). In another recent publication, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration identified that worldwide, CKD is the most prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19. Moreover, the distribution of risk factors for COVID-19 mortality appears to be different in patients with CKD when compared with the general population. The high prevalence of CKD in combination with the elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19 in CKD necessitates urgent action for this group of patients. This article defines essential action points (summarized in Box 1), among which is advocating the inclusion of CKD patients in clinical trials testing the efficacy of drugs and vaccines to prevent severe COVID-19.

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical courses of 12 COVID-19 patients who received IVIG at various stages of their illness, including within the first 72 h of clinical presentation, after initiation of mechanical ventilation, and after prolonged ventilation and ICU stay. The patients included 9 men and 3 women with a median age of 50 years (range 23-74), median Charlson Comorbidity Score of 2 (range 0-7), and median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score of 13 (range 5-33) at the time of IVIG. The IVIG total dose ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg (median 1.25 g/kg) distributed over 1-4 daily doses. The most common regimen received was 0.5 g/kg daily for 3 days. The median time to IVIG administration was 9 days (range 0-48 days) after admission. The median time from first IVIG dose administration to hospital discharge was 14 days (range 3-48). The 5 patients who received IVIG <=4 days of admission demonstrated a significantly shorter length of hospital stay after treatment (median 7 days, range 3-14 days) than the 7 patients who received it >7 days after admission (median 33 days, range 8-48 days, p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). These cases demonstrate that IVIG may improve the clinical state of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Despite very high illness severity scores, all patients survived hospital discharge. No thrombotic events occurred and IVIG was well tolerated, despite most cases demonstrating very elevated D-dimer suggestive of active intravascular fibrinolysis. We believe that IVIG warrants immediate clinical trial evaluation in COVID-19 to confirm its role as a mainstay treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection as a means to reduce hospital stay and utilization of ICU resources, including mechanical ventilation, and potentially reduce mortality.

{"text": "COVID-19 Vaccines May Not Prevent Nasal SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Asymptomatic Transmission. Current COVID-19 vaccine candidates are administered by injection and designed to produce an IgG response, preventing viremia and the COVID-19 syndrome. However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as an infectious disease, is now prevalent in many countries around the world, which has recently led many governments to home quarantine and impose penalties for violating quarantine. Concerns and stress caused by lockdown and social isolation led to personal and interactive reactions in some families, which are also culturally important to address. This study was administrated to study the psychological well-being and the effect of home quarantine on marital satisfaction (MS) and parental burnout (PB) from parenting responsibilities during the prevalence of COVID-19 in Iranian parents. A total of 213 parents (140 mothers and 73 fathers) voluntarily participated in the online survey in the period of February to mid-April 2020 and completed the 5-item index of the well-being of the World Health Organization (WHO-5), the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale (KMSS), and the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA). The results showed that the effect of home quarantine on MS and PB was not significant in parents (p > 0.01). The interactive effect of home quarantine and gender was not significant on MS and PB (p > 0.01). In addition, the mothers significantly reported higher PB than the fathers, but the fathers had higher scores in MS and psychological well-being (p < 0.01).

The presence of infection promotes the generation of resistance alleles, and there are some evolutionary and genetic clues that suggest the presence of an iron deficiency phenotype that may have developed to protect against infection. Examples include the relative paucity of iron overload genes given the essential role of iron, as well as the persistence of iron deficiency among populations in spite of public health efforts to treat it. Additional examination of geographic areas with severe iron deficiency in the setting of pandemics including H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19 reveals that areas with higher prevalence of iron deficiency are less affected. RNA viruses have several evolutionary adaptations which suggest their absolute need for iron, and this dependency may be exploited during treatment. Conclusion(s): RNA viruses pose a unique challenge to modern healthcare, with an average of 2-3 new pathogens being discovered yearly. Their overarching requirements for iron, along with human evolutionary and genetic adaptations which favored an iron deficiency phenotype, ultimately suggest the potential need for iron control in these infections.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, psychological reactions of the population play a critical role in both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress and social disorder. AIM: This study aimed to measure the prevalence and severity of psychological distress to evaluate the current mental health burden on society that leads to the provision of a concrete basis for tailoring and implementing relevant mental health intervention policies to efficiently and effectively respond to the challenges brought by the pandemic. METHOD(S): An anonymous, internet-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020. In this regard, a structured online questionnaire was utilized to collect sociodemographic data and the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sociodemographic and prevalence of CPDI among respondents. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of distress. RESULT(S): Most of the respondents did not feel distressed about COVID-19 (52.1%), whereas 39.5% and 8.4% had mild-to-moderate and severe distress. The regression analysis demonstrated that higher religion and faithfulness levels, lower levels of education, and living in Mindanao (unlike those living in the Visayas) were associated with lower levels of psychological distress among the Filipino respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION(S): Policy-makers and practitioners in the in Filipino society need to consider key factors such as religion, education, and the region where they live in to reduce psychological distress among Filipinos.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Roy Rillera Marzo, Emilio Quilatan Villanueva III, Erwin Martinez Faller, Aries Moralidad Baldonado.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background Singapore saw an escalation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases from under 4,000 in April 2020 to over 40,000 in June 2020 largely attributed to spread within shared facilities housing foreign workers. Appropriate triage and escalation of clinical care are critical for this patient group managed in community care facilities (CCFs). Purpose To evaluate the imaging guideline recommendations for COVID-19 from the Fleischner Society and analyze the clinical utility of chest radiograph screening for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who were admitted to Singapore Expo, a designated CCF, for continuation of their management during May 3-31, 2020 were identified. Upon admission, patients aged 36 and older without any baseline chest imaging received a chest radiograph. All chest radiographs and clinical outcomes of patients including those who were subsequently transferred to acute hospitals for escalation of care were reviewed. Key proportions of patients with findings of pulmonary infection and those requiring further inpatient treatment were calculated, and 95% binomial proportion confidence intervals obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. Results The study included 5,621 patients: all men 100% (5,621/5,621), mean age 37 +/- 8 years (range 17-60). A total of 1,964 chest radiographs were performed of which normal accounted for 98.0% (1,925/1,964) and findings of pulmonary infection represented 2.0% (39/1,964). Only 0.2% (4/1,964) with chest radiograph findings of pulmonary infection (all of whom were symptomatic) required supplemental oxygenation and inpatient treatment. None of the asymptomatic patients with findings of pulmonary infection required supplemental oxygenation, and they received only symptomatic treatment. Conclusion In accordance with Fleischner Society recommendations, chest radiograph screening for patients with COVID-19 aged 17-60 with mild or no symptoms is not indicated unless there is risk of clinical deterioration.

{"text": "Dynamic Anti-Spike Protein Antibody Profiles in COVID-19 Patients. OBJECTIVES: This study intended to investigate the dynamics of anti-spike (S) IgG and IgM antibodies in COVID-19 patients., METHODS: Anti-S IgG/IgM were determined by a semi-quantitative fluorescence immunoassay in the plasma of COVID-19 patients at the manifestation and rehabilitation stages. The immunoreactivity to full-length S proteins,C-terminal domain (CTD) andN-terminal domain (NTD)of S1fragment were determined by an ELISA assay. Clinical properties at admission and discharge were collected simultaneously., RESULTS: The positive rates of anti-S IgG/IgM in COVID-19 patients were elevated after rehabilitation when compared to the in-patients. Anti-S IgG and IgM were not apparent until day 14 and day 10 respectively according to Simple Moving Average analysis with 5 days' slide window deduction. More than 90% of the rehabilitation patients exhibited IgG and IgM responses targeting CTD-S1 fragments. There exhibited the decrease in peripheral total lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts in COVID-19 patients at admission and recovered after therehabilitation., CONCLUSIONS: Anti-S IgG and IgM do not appear at the onset with the decrease in T cells, making early serological screening less significant. However, the presence of high IgG and IgM to S1-CTD in the recovered patients highlights humoral responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be associated with efficient immune protection in COVID-19 patients.

This study was performed to evaluate concentration of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to monitor treatment response of COVID -19 patients at the post hospitalization period. Results of present study revealed that there significant increases in patients showing abnormal values for the LDH, CRP, and ferritin; but not for D-dimer that decreased significantly. Higher elevation (P<0.0001) in concentration of blood biomarkers was detected among the group of abnormal values when compared to the group of normal values of study patients. In addition, the concentration of D-dimer had showed a significant higher concentration in patients with abnormal values. Concerning time-required recovery and age factors, we showed that the patients required 4-30 (13.35+/-0.65) days for recovery; while the age of study population was ranged 26-95 (54.85+/-1.57) years and the percentage of COVID-19 patients were increased with the advancing of age. Relation to gender factor, abnormal values of study biomarkers reported that there no significant differences (P>0.05) between males and females. Among three study age groups (<=39, 40-59, and >=60 years), the findings of study biomarkers showed insignificant differences (P>0.05) in concentration of D-dimer, CRP, and LDH; but not in concentration of ferritin that increased significantly (P<=0.0065) at the group of 40-59 years. As well as the findings of time-required recovery found that there insignificant variation (0<=0.084) between the study age groups. In conclusion, our study found a significant prevalence of abnormal values and significant elevation in concentration of blood biomarkers, particularly Di-dimer, in recovered COVID-19 patients indicating the potential high risk of infection. Therefore, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave post the course of the disease could help in identifying severe disease and subsequently improve prognosis.

{"text": "[COVID-19 and the kidneys-Clinical aspects]. The aim of this article is to explain the clinical benefits of the growing knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 can invade multiple cell types in other organs, such as the kidneys and replicate there. Important damaging pathways of the virus, such as vascular endotheliitis, thrombotic events and systemic cytokine release are still incompletely understood. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease that necessitates intensive medical care and in particular, internal medicine involvement and represents a major challenge for all disciplines of internal medicine. Among these, nephrology in particular is involved in the fight against COVID-19 in a variety of ways: urine investigations can provide indications of multiple organ involvement, endotheliitis, microthrombi and microcirculation damage, etc. Experience with low serum albumin levels and antithrombin III activity in nephrotic patients helps to point out the decreasing effects of loop diuretics and heparin to other specialist disciplines. Nephrological knowledge of the complications of hypoalbuminemia and \"resistance\" to diuretics must lead to an early implementation of renal replacement procedures in order to be able to prevent mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 intensive care patients with increased extracellular lung fluid. The kidneys can be used as a seismograph for severe courses of COVID-19 and nephrological knowledge can be brought to use to optimize the intensive medical care for critically ill patients. Both together have the potential to considerably reduce morbidity and mortality further.

{"text": "Increased unemployment from the COVID-19 pandemic, what might be the adverse impacts on cardiovascular disease in Aotearoa/New Zealand and how might this be prevented?. Despite success with eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand (at least to early August 2020), the response to the pandemic threat has resulted in a range of negative social and economic impacts, including job losses. Understanding the health consequences of these impacts will be increasingly important in the 'recovery' phase. This article contributes to this understanding by exploring the relationship between unemployment and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-a major contributor to health loss in Aotearoa New Zealand. We reviewed the literature about the impact of unemployment on CVD. The totality of the evidence suggested that increased unemployment arising from economic shocks is associated with increased CVD incidence, particularly for middle-aged men. Continued monitoring and active policy responses are required to prevent increases in CVD (and other health outcomes) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For example, quantifying the CVD-related health loss from pandemic-associated unemployment, along with the health costs and impact on health inequalities, could help with government decision-making to reduce CVD burdens. This could be via intensifying tobacco control, regulating the food supply (eg, to reduce salt/sodium levels), and improving uptake of CVD preventive medications such as statins and anti-hypertensives.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Some countries collapsed under surge conditions, while others (such as Malta) showed resilience. Public health measures in Malta quickly reined in COVID-19 spread. This review summarizes pandemic preparedness measures in Malta and the impact on routine services., METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Google, Google Scholar and PubMed and by reviewing Maltese online newspapers. A comprehensive summary of internal operations conducted at Mater Dei Hospital (MDH) was made available., RESULTS: A hospital 'Incident Command Group' was set up to plan an optimal COVID-19 response strategy. A 'rapid response team' was also created to cater for the logistics and management of supplies. A 'COVID-19 Emergency Operation Centre' simulated different COVID-19 scenarios. All elective services were suspended and all staff were mandatorily trained in wearing personal protective equipment. Staff were also retrained in the care of COVID-19 patients. In preparation for potential admission surges, MDH underwent rapid expansion of normal and intensive care beds. Swabbing was ramped up to one of the highest national rates worldwide. The cost for hospital COVID-19 preparedness exceeded 100 million for Malta's half a million population., CONCLUSION: Malta and its sole acute hospital coped well with the first wave with 680 cases and 9 deaths. The increased ability to deal with COVID-19 (a principally respiratory pathogen) will serve well for the anticipated combined annual influenza and the COVID-19 second wave this coming winter.

BACKGROUND: Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease in the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns are raised over their threat to mental health especially among vulnerable groups including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have tested whether and how these control measures may affect mental health. No study investigated prevalence and impacts of utilizing eHealth among pregnant women during the outbreak., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated 1) the roles of lockdown and mandatory quarantine in affecting mental health problems (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms), 2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and 3) the moderation roles of eHealth-related factors (i.e., social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services during COVID-19) among pregnant women in China., METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions (24 February-10 March, 2020)., RESULTS: Of the participants, 62.6% reported lockdown in the areas of residence and 3.8% were subjected to mandatory quarantine; 44.6% reported probable depression, 29.2% had probable anxiety, and 7.4% reported suicidal ideation. Only 3.3% of the participants reported using online prenatal care service during the outbreak. Significant socio-demographic/maternal variables of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, area of residence, gestational duration, number of children born, complication during pregnancy, means of utilizing prenatal care services, and social media use for health information. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modeling [chi2(df)=495.21(14), p<.05, CFI=.99, NNFI=.98, RMSEA=.04 (90%CI=.038, .045)] showed quarantine status was strongly associated with poor mental health status directly and indirectly through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04, beta =.02, 95%CI=.01 to .02, p=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03, beta=.03, 95%CI=.02 to .03, p=.001). Multi-group analyses revealed social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths., CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance to integrate mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policy. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators are modifiable, and can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women., CLINICALTRIAL:", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 became a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries and territories. Millions of lives are still affected because of mandatory quarantines, which hamstring economies and induce panic. Immunology plays a major role in the modern field of medicine, especially against virulent infectious diseases. In this field, neutralizing antibodies are heavily studied because they reflect the level of infection and individuals' immune status, which are essential when considering resumption of work, flight travel, and border entry control. More importantly, it also allows evaluating the antiviral vaccine efficacy as vaccines are still known for being the ultimate intervention method to inhibit the rapid spread of virulent infectious diseases. In this Review, we first introduce the host immune response after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the latest results using conventional immunoassays. Next, as an enabling platform for detection with sufficient sensitivity while saving analysis time and sample size, the progress of microfluidic-based immunoassays is discussed and compared based on surface modification, microfluidic kinetics, signal output, signal amplification, sample matrix, and the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The Sardinian Experience. Aim: SARS-CoV-2 infection is a world-wide public health problem. Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcome., Method and Materials: We recruited 619 healthy Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms, pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA allele and haplotype frequencies., Results: Male sex and older age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency. None of these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively common finding in the Sardinian population. The extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1 (95% CI 0-0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients, while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.8-8.1), Pc = 0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95% CI 2.7-220.6), Pc = 0.024]., Conclusion: The data emerging from our study suggest that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the beta-thalassemic trait.

Here we examine differences in vulnerability to COVID-19 among the ten administrative regions and two major cities of Cameroon based on epidemiological risk factors and access to healthcare resources., Methods: regional epidemiological and healthcare access vulnerability indices were created and compared with cumulative COVID-19 cases, case fatality rates, co-morbidities, and healthcare resources in Cameroon., Results: based on epidemiological risk factors, populations in the East Region, Douala (in the Littoral Region), West Region, and Yaounde (in the Center Region) are at highest risk for COVID-19. Meanwhile, the North, Far North, East, and Adamawa Regions had the most healthcare access vulnerability. COVID-19 cases per population were highest in the Center, Littoral, and East Regions. Case fatality rates were greatest in the North Region. Potential co-morbidities with greater prevalence among COVID-19 patients included male sex, hypertension, and diabetes., Conclusion: epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19 and access to healthcare varies between the regions of Cameroon. These discrepancies are potentially reflected in regional differences of COVID-19 cases and case fatality rates. In particular, the East Region has high epidemiological risk factors and low healthcare accessibility compared to other regions.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. Currently almost every country in the world has reported cases with moderate to high mortality rates. The European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK) are the severely affected countries. Nevertheless, the WHO is very much concern about countries with weak health systems. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 varies extensively, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe as well as critical pneumonia with high mortality rates in the elderly and patients with co-morbid medical illness. Convalescent Plasma Therapy (CPT) has been successfully used in treating various viral disease outbreaks such as 1918 influenza pneumonia pandemic, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, Machupo virus, Junin virus, Lassa virus, Ebola etc. High-titer specific antibodies maybe capable of binding to Coronavirus- 19 (CoV-19) and neutralize the viral particles, inhibit entry to uninfected cells, and trigger potent effector mechanisms such as complement activation as well as phagocytosis. Therefore, in most countries with very weak health systems with no Intensive Care Units (ICUs) or trained ICU physicians, early initiation of CPT for severely COVID- 19 patients may be rewarding. Therefore, solidarity control trials on CPT for COVID- 19 patients involving large number of patients are urgently needed. \u00a9Copyright: the Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The influence of abdominal adiposity-assessed by an increased waist-hip ratio-and metabolic syndrome on respiratory deterioration and the length of hospital stay were analysed with multivariable logistic regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses., RESULTS: In total, 166 patients were analysed, of whom 86 (52%) tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between patients with COVID-19 with and without the need for intubation or level of supportive care (37.5% vs 48.4%, p=0.338). In contrast, abdominal adiposity is an independent risk factor for respiratory distress in COVID-19, adjusted for metabolic syndrome, age, gender and BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20, p=0.014)., CONCLUSION: This study shows that abdominal adiposity, and not the presence of metabolic syndrome, is associated with clinical deterioration in COVID-19. This prospective study provides further insight into the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 based on a simple measurement as the waist and hip circumference., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NL8580.

{"text": "Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women at Elmhurst Hospital Center, Queens, New York. BACKGROUND: Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection on Labor and Delivery (L&D) units is a critical strategy to manage patient and health worker safety, especially in a vulnerable high-prevalence community. We describe the results of a SARS-CoV-2 universal screening program at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, NY, a 545-bed public hospital serving a diverse, largely immigrant and low-income patient population and an epicenter of the global pandemic., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. All pregnant women admitted to the L&D Unit of Elmhurst Hospital from March 29, 2020 to April 22, 2020 were included for analysis. The primary outcomes of the study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity among universally screened pregnant women, stratified by demographic characteristics, maternal comorbidities, and delivery outcomes; and (2) Symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation at the time of testing among SARS-CoV-2 positive women. A total of 126 obstetric patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March 29 and April 22. Of these, 37% were positive. Of the women who tested positive, 72% were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (unadjusted difference 24.4 percentage points, CI 7.9, 41.0) and report their primary language as Spanish (unadjusted difference 32.9 percentage points, CI 15.8, 49.9) than patients who tested negative., CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a universal SARS-Cov-2 screening program implemented in the L&D unit of a safety-net hospital in Queens, New York, we found over one-third of pregnant women testing positive, the majority of those asymptomatic. The rationale for universal screening at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital was to ensure safety of patients and staff during an acute surge in SARS-Cov-2 infections through appropriate identification and isolation of pregnant women with positive test results. Women were roomed by their SARS-CoV-2 status given increasing space limitations. In addition, postpartum counseling was tailored to infection status. We quickly established discharge counseling and follow-up protocols tailored to their specific social needs. The experience at Elmhurst Hospital is instructive for other L&D units serving vulnerable populations and for pandemic preparedness.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: To analyze the association of D-dimer levels, inflammatory indicators, cytokine abnormality, and disease severity in COVID-19 severe/critical type patients. Methods: The medical records of 41 patients were collected from a single center in Wuhan from February 8, 2020 to March 25, 2020. The patients were divided into severe type group (28 patients) and critical type group (13 patients) . The levels of D-dimer, WBC, ANC, PCT, hsCRP, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were compared among patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the changes in the cytokines were analyzed in patients with different D-dimer levels. And, the levels of D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha before and after anticoagulant therapy were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 41 patients, 23 were men (56.1%) and 18 were women (43.9%) ; the median patient age was 57 y. The age of the critical type patients [ (61.1+/-10.4) y] was higher than that of severe type patients [ (52.8+/-11.7) y]; the difference was significant (t=-2.264, P=0.032) . The proportion of critical type patients with chronic diseases, especially hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, was higher as compared to that in those with severe type patients; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . The prevalence of dyspnea, sweats, and fatigue symptoms in the critical type patients was higher than that in those with severe type disease; the differences were significant (chi(2)=14.898, 6.972, 7.823; P<0.001, 0.008, 0.005) . The levels of D-dimer, WBC, ANC, PCT, hsCRP, and IL-8 in critical type patients were higher than those in severe type patients; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . The levels of IL-2R, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in patients with abnormal D-dimer were higher as compared to those in patients with normal D-dimer levels; the differences were significant (all P<0.05) . Eight patients were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation; the levels of D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6 and IL-8 after anticoagulant therapy were lower than those before treatment. Conclusions: COVID-19 critical type patients have more serious coagulation-immune dysfunction and dynamic monitoring of D-dimer and cytokines levels helps in identifying critical type patients as early as possible; anticoagulant therapy may improve the patient's condition by correcting coagulation-immune dysfunction.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. This study aimed to evaluate a panel of biomarkers in order to better phenotype population and to define the role of mediators as biomarkers of severity.Materials and methods: Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients at the hospital admission before any treatments and infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C peptide were measured with CLEIA methods. IL-6 assays were validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate group was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and a logistic regression was performed to combine parameters between the two groups. Result(s): In severe group, IL-6 CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly increased than mild-to-moderate patients. Moreover KL-6, IL-6 and CRP biomarkers resulted directly correlated. In the logistic regression, ROC curve analysis of the model comprise IL-6, KL-6 and CRP reported the best performance with an AUC 0,95. Conclusion(s): On corroborating previous reports on IL-6 over-expression in severe COVID 19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations are correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP. The combination of three prognostic bioindicators allowed to discriminate between severe COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis from mild-tomoderate patients.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 is getting wider with the exponential increase of patients worldwide. Initially described with flu-like symptoms, variable cutaneous manifestations have been reported, with only few histopathological descriptions. Detection of the virus in cutaneous samples has been assessed in very few cases until now, and the causative role of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been proven for every type of cutaneous manifestations yet. We aimed to describe histological features of cutaneous eruptions occurring concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess by immunochemistry and in situ hybridization using RNAscope validation techniques the presence of the virus in skin lesions. We retrieved all skin biopsies received in the departments of pathology and dermatopathology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, performed in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients presenting concomitant cutaneous manifestations since March 2020. In situ hybridization and immunostaining using a polyclonal SARS nucleocapsid protein antibody were performed on each sample. Skin biopsies from six patients presenting morbilliform eruption concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection were available for evaluation. All six samples showed varying degrees of spongiosis, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the dermis, and, for some of them, discrete interface dermatitis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were negative in all cutaneous samples. Morbilliform rash concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by mild and unspecific histopathological features with no detectable viral RNA and protein and appears then not to be directly caused by the virus. Even if, at least for a few cases, the differential diagnosis with drug hypersensitivity reaction can be difficult, these cutaneous eruptions seem to rather correspond to paraviral rashes.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

On the other hand, the percentage of children discharged right after pediatric visit significantly decreased from 80% in January to 50% in April. After March 9th, we registered a change in the diagnoses of emergency department visits, with an increase in the percentage of non-infectious acute conditions and a decrease in infectious diseases, with two cases of a noteworthy delayed access to hospital care. We performed a retrospective analysis of consultations requested to our pediatric unit for children and adolescents referred to the general Emergency Department of San Luca Hospital of Lucca (Tuscany, Central Italy) from January 1st to May 31st, 2020.

{"text": "WELLS SCORE TO PREDICT PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN PATIENTS WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE-2019. BACKGROUND: The association of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with hypercoagulability has been extensively described. Consequently, pulmonary embolism is a recognized complication of COVID-19. Currently, the need for Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) relies on the Wells score and serum D-dimer levels. However, since COVID-19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population. We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19., METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID-19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis. Patients' age and gender, CTPA results, and associated D-dimer levels were entered in a database. The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and an area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) measured., RESULTS: Of 459 patients with COVID-19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 (19%) had evidence of pulmonary embolism. Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above four points, and serum D-dimer levels five times above age-adjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism. However, only 33% of patients with PE had a Wells score of four points or higher. The AUC/ROC showed non-discriminating values (0.54) CONCLUSION: While a Wells score of four or more points predicted pulmonary embolism in our cohort, the outcome can be present even with lower scores.

{"text": "IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA PURPURA ASSOCIATED WITH NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION. Thrombocytopenia is usually multifactorial as its pathogenesis is likely to be more complex than the conventional model of platelet consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation. The use of antibiotics, antivirals, heparin, and other commonly used agents, as well as haemodialysis, may contribute in some cases. Furthermore, platelet production may be affected by direct viral insult to the bone marrow or reduced effect of thrombopoietin. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), poses dilemmas for the investigation of thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was noted in up to one third COVID-19-hospitalized patients. Besides that, platelet count was lower in those with very severe disease: the lower the platelet count, the worse the prognosis. Mortality may also increase with progressively lower platelet counts. In most COVID-19 cases of thrombocytopenia, the platelet count does not fall below 100x109/L. Severe degree of thrombocytopenia (< 20 x 109/L, or a sudden drop > 50% over 24-48 h) is likely to indicate an immune aetiology. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is a diagnosis of exclusion, there being no confirmative test. Herein we describe a rare case of immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) associated with COVID-19. A previously healthy and nullipara 23-years-old woman visited the Emergency Department after 2 days of retroorbital headache, sneezing, dry cough, sore throat, shivers, and non-measured fever. She also complained petechiae and spontaneous mild gingival hemorrhage. Due to local epidemics, dengue infection was considered, although NS1 fast-test was non-reagent and C-reactive protein was normal. Her blood count was normal, as the test performed almost 10 months before. Three days later (Jul/30/2020), she was admitted in the hospital wards, without any complain except from worsening of the petechiae. Her platelet count dropped from 231.9 x 103/mm3 to 5.8 x 103/mm3, and platelet concentrate was transfused. Dengue serology was IgM negative and IgG positive, and she confirmed previous 2 episodes of dengue infection. RT-PCR on naso-/oropharynx swab detected SARS-CoV-2. Reticulocyte count was normal and no schistocyte was observed in blood smear. Clotting assays and fibrinogen were normal, and D-dimers were slightly increased. She had microscopic hematuria with normal renal function tests. Total and fractionated bilirubin, and transaminases were normal, although lactic dehydrogenase was slightly elevated. Thyroid function was normal. Protein electrophoresis was normal. Folate and vitamin B12 levels were normal. Thoracic computed tomography was normal. Anti-nuclear antibodies, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus tests were non-reagent. She was immunized against hepatitis B virus. Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative, but direct Coombs test and lupus anticoagulant assay were positive. Prednisone 1 mg/kg was administered for 5 days (Jul/01-05/2020). Platelet count increased and petechiae solved. She was discharged home on Jul/05/2020, when her platelet count was 191.9 x 103/mm3. She had 207.0 x 103 platelets/mm3 on her last visit, when prednisone was 0.1 m g/kg (Jul/07/2020). Although thrombocytopenia may be a predictor of worse prognosis in COVID-19, no relationship between ITP and outcome was described yet. Currently, after excluding other causes of (severe) thrombocytopenia, the treatment of COVID-19-associated ITP should be similar the treatment of non-COVID-19 individuals.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We used sortase A for ligation of click chemistry functional groups site-specifically to the C-terminus of nanobodies before creating C-to-C-terminal nanobody fusions and 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) tetrameric nanobody constructs. We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays.

{"text": "Covid-19 susceptibility and severity might be modified by vitamin d status: Theoretical and practical considerations. Background: The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has resulted in the Covid-19 pandemic with severe morbidity and high mortality, particularly in certain sections of the population. The co-morbidity patterns associated with adverse outcomes are multiple and complex and there is emerging epidemiological, nutritional and molecular biological evidence that an inadequate vitamin D status is a contributing factor. Objective(s): The aim was to review the role of vitamin D in immune function with particular reference to the mechanisms whereby it supports immune efficiency, host protection and immune modulation. The evidence for the possible benefit of vitamin D supplementation to ameliorate the severity of respiratory infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens was also reviewed with a view to making a recommendation. Method(s): PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar were searched using the terms: Covid-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, vitamin D, calcitriol, deficiency, adaptive immunity, innate immunity, ventilation, critical care, intensive care, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, respiratory viruses, respiratory tract infection, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, supplementation. Papers for inclusion were selected on the basis of relevance and quality. Finding(s): Vitamin D insufficiency is widespread in many parts of the world. Vitamin D is needed for normal protective and surveillance immune function and there is evidence that deficiency increases the risk of some respiratory infections, probably including Covid-19. By binding with dedicated receptors on immune cells vitamin D influences several strands of immune function, including the production of anti-microbial peptides and several cytokines that promote an appropriate immune response. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the risk of respiratory infection, with persuasive biological, epidemiological and observational evidence for possible benefit against Covid-19. Conclusion(s): Despite the lack of direct evidence specific to Covid-19 a cogent theoretical case can be made for giving adults from selected groups, and arguably all adults, routine supplementation with vitamin D to improve immune efficiency and reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory infections. This could be particularly important in sections of the population with a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency.

BackgroundEvidence for face-mask wearing in the community to protect against respiratory disease is unclear.AimTo assess effectiveness of wearing face masks in the community to prevent respiratory disease, and recommend improvements to this evidence base. Methods We systematically searched Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE for studies evaluating respiratory disease incidence after face-mask wearing (or not). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention were performed, subgrouped by design, setting, face barrier type, and who wore the mask. Preferred outcome was influenza-like illness. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) quality assessment was undertaken and evidence base deficits described. Results 33 studies (12 randomised control trials (RCTs)) were included. Mask wearing reduced primary infection by 6% (odds ratio (OR): 0.94; 95% CI: 0.75-1.19 for RCTs) to 61% (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.32-2.27; OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.84 and OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.45-0.85 for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies respectively). RCTs suggested lowest secondary attack rates when both well and ill household members wore masks (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.48-1.37). While RCTs might underestimate effects due to poor compliance and controls wearing masks, observational studies likely overestimate effects, as mask wearing might be associated with other risk-averse behaviours. GRADE was low or very low quality. Conclusion Wearing face masks may reduce primary respiratory infection risk, probably by 6-15%. It is important to balance evidence from RCTs and observational studies when their conclusions widely differ and both are at risk of significant bias.

{"text": "PERFIL DE PROBLEMAS IMUNO-HEMATOLOGICOS IDENTIFICADOS EM AMOSTRAS DE PACIENTES DURANTE A PANDEMIA COVID-19. Introducao: A pandemia provocada pelo SARS-CoV-2 impactou significativamente todas as areas de atuacao e principalmente a saude. Hospitais se adequaram para fornecer melhor suporte e podemos dizer que na terapia transfusional nao foi diferente. Apesar do cancelamento de procedimentos eletivos, pacientes que necessitam de transfusoes continuaram sendo atendidos e trouxeram desafios tanto na captacao de doadores durante o periodo de crise, quanto nos testes imuno-hematologicos para liberacao de hemocomponentes de forma segura. Objetivo: Descrever o perfil de problemas imuno-hematologicos que justificaram investigacao no laboratorio de imuno-hematologia especializada, em amostras de pacientes que receberam transfusao sanguinea no periodo de Janeiro de 2020 a Julho de 2020 no Centro de Hemoterapia, Hematologia e Terapia Celular do Ceara (Fujisan). Material e metodos: Foram avaliadas 317 amostras de pacientes, media de 45 mensal (Min. 32 - Max. 75) que apresentaram discrepancias ABO ou reacao positiva na pesquisa de anticorpo irregular em tubo (Fresenius). A pesquisa e identificacao de anticorpos nas amostras destes pacientes foram realizadas pela tecnica de aglutinacao em gel LISS/Coombs e NaCl (Biorad), com tecnicas complementares como tratamento do soro com Dithiothreitol - DTT (Sigma-Aldrich), aloadsorcao e eluicao. Resultados: Em comparacao com 2019, observamos uma reducao de 30% no numero de pacientes transfundidos nesse mesmo periodo. Em contrapartida, o numero de casos enviados para investigacao imuno-hematologica aumentou em 150%. Dos casos enviados, 172 (54%) foram de pacientes aloimunizados com historico previo, 63 (20%) novatos com alo ou autoanticorpos identificados, 47 (15%) casos inicialmente considerados como falso-positivos e 35 (11%) casos inconclusivos. Dos 63 pacientes identificados, 31 (49%) apresentaram um aloanticorpo, 05 (8%) possuiam dois aloanticorpos, 02 (3%) pacientes tres aloanticorpos, e 07 (11%) apresentaram associacao entre alo e autoanticorpos quente ou frio. Em 18 (29%) pacientes foram encontrados somente autoanticorpos da classe IgM ou IgG. Dos 45 pacientes que apresentaram aloanticorpos, 26 (58%) possuiam anticorpos dirigidos contra antigenos do sistema Rh associados ou nao com autoanticorpos. Discussao: Durante a pandemia, apesar da reducao no numero de transfusoes, observamos um aumento significativo no numero de amostras com resultados discrepantes e ate mesmo inconclusivos nos testes imuno-hematologicos, alem de amostras altamente hemolisadas e coaguladas. Embora os meses de pico em Fortaleza-CE tenham sido em Abril e Maio, resultados desse mesmo tipo foram encontrados desde Janeiro de 2020 sem causa aparente. A partir do aumento no numero de casos, observamos que a maioria pertencia ao mesmo quadro: infeccao pelo coronavirus, uso de hidroxicloroquina e heparina. Dessa forma, nao foi possivel a resolucao da investigacao imuno-hematologica em 26% das amostras recebidas. Dos casos solucionados, 58% dos pacientes apresentavam anticorpos dirigidos contra antigenos do sistema Rh. Conclusao: A pandemia nos trouxe diversos desafios e muitas questoes que permanecem sem resposta, inclusive na terapia transfusional. Embora o perfil de aloimunizacao dos pacientes tenha se mantido nesse periodo, nossa taxa de casos inconclusivos tornou-se alta, necessitando de estudos aprofundados para melhor elucidacao da situacao atual.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Materiais e metodos: Estudo de revisao bibliografica de natureza descritiva. Foi realizada busca ativa nas plataformas Scielo e PUBMed, com eleicao de 32 artigos publicados de 2004 a junho de 2020 com os descritores: \"Anticoagulants (therapy)\", \"Thromboembolism\", \"Covid-19\", \"Anticoagulation\", \"Tromboembolismo\", \"Covid-19 e Tromboembolismo\". Resultados: Pacientes com SARS-CoV-2 apresentaram valores menores de antitrombina (85% vs. 99%; p < 0.001) e tempo de atividade da protrombina (81% vs. 97%; p < 0.001), e valores aumentados de D-dimero (10.36 vs. 0.26 ng/L; p < 0.001), produtos de degradacao da fibrina/fibrinogenio (33.83 vs. 1.55 mg/L; p < 0.001) e fibrinogenio (5.02 vs. 2.90 g/L; p < 0.001) em comparacao a outros pacientes, alem dainterleucina 6 e aumento da forca do coagulo. Com relacao ao risco de desenvolvimento de tromboembolismo, a prevalencia em pacientes hospitalizados variou de 25 ate 53%, alem de muitos classificados de alto risco pelo escore de Padua. A autopsia de pacientes com COVID-19 apresentaram principalmente trombose venosa profunda, sendo embolia pulmonar causa direta de muitas das mortes, alem da presenca de trombos em microvasculatura de diversos orgaos e grandes arterias pulmonares, e maior numero de megacariocitos. Em relacao a profilaxia de eventos tromboembolicos, os medicamentos mais relatados foram heparina, concentrado de antitrombina e clopidogrel, sendo a heparina o farmaco mais utilizado e mais descrito na literatura pesquisada. Discussao: Pacientes com COVID-19 apresentaram maior risco de desenvolver tromboembolismo venoso (TEV) e outras complicacoes se comparado aos pacientes hospitalizados em geral, devido ao estado pro-trombotico gerado pela propria infeccao. Nesses pacientes, o uso de anticoagulantes profilaticos mostrou-se eficiente em diminuir o risco de TEV e outras complicacoes.

{"text": "Is positivity for hepatitis C virus antibody predictive of lower risk of death in COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis?. Liver injury has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases but the impact of pre-existing liver damage and related etiology have not been completely elucidated. Our research interests include the potential reciprocal influence of COVID-19 and pre-existing liver damage related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in particular. To this end, we have evaluated three cohorts of patients admitted at three Italian hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic; these included 332 patients with COVID-19 and 1527 patients with HCV who were from established real-world antiviral treatment study cohorts (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir), with either liver disease (various severities; n = 1319) or cirrhosis (n = 208). Among the COVID-19 patients, 10 had cirrhosis (3%), including 7 of metabolic origin and 3 of viral origin. Mortality among the COVID-19 patients was 27.1%, with 70% of those with cirrhosis of metabolic etiology having died. Cirrhosis, older age, low white blood cell count and lymphocyte count being identified as risk predictors of death [odds ratio (OR) = 13.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.59-83.01, P = 0.006; OR = 1.05, 95%CI: 1.03-1.08, P = 0.0001; OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.36-1.16, P = 0.001; OR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.39-0.93, P = 0.023, respectively]. In the two cohorts of HCV patients, COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 0.07% of those with liver disease and 1% of those with cirrhosis. Thus, the prevalence of HCV antibodies among COVID-19-infected patients was comparable to that currently reported for the general population in Italy. Amongst the COVID-19 patients, pre-existing metabolic cirrhosis appears to be associated with higher mortality, while HCV antibodies may be suggestive of \"protection\" against COVID-19.

The present study explores the potential association between serum nitrate levels and mortality in COVID-19 patients., DESIGN: A prospective observation study was carried out., SETTING: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain)., PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU., INTERVENTIONS: Determination of serum nitrate levels at ICU admission., MAIN VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days., RESULTS: Non-surviving (n=11) compared to surviving patients (n=42) showed higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA scores (p=0.004), and higher serum nitrate levels (p=0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed serum nitrate levels to be associated to 30-day mortality after controlling for SOFA (OR=1.021; 95%CI=1.006-1.036; p=0.01) or APACHE-II (OR=1.023; 95%CI=1.006-1.041; p=0.01).

Reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. The epidemiology of GBS cases reported to the UK National Immunoglobulin Database was studied from 2016 to 2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were stratified by hospital trust and region, with numbers of reported cases per month. UK population data for COVID-19 infection were collated from UK public health bodies. In parallel, but separately, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society prospectively reported incident cases of GBS during the pandemic at their hospitals to a central register. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases in his cohort were compared. The incidence of GBS treated in UK hospitals from 2016 to 2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100 000 individuals per year. In 2020, GBS and COVID-19 incidences varied between regions and did not correlate with one another (r = 0.06, 95% confidence interval: -0.56 to 0.63, P = 0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-19. In an independent cohort study, 47 GBS cases were reported (COVID-19 status: 13 definite, 12 probable, 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome between these groups. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19 affected cohort (7/13, 54% versus 5/22, 23% in COVID-19-negative) likely related to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Although it is not possible to entirely rule out the possibility of a link this study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS.

INTRODUCTION: Wheezing is a major problem in children, and respiratory viruses are often believed to be the causative agent. While molecular detection tools enable identification of respiratory viruses in wheezing children, it remains unclear if and how these viruses are associated with wheezing. The objective of this systematic review is to clarify the prevalence of different respiratory viruses in children with wheezing., METHODS: We performed an electronic in Pubmed and Global Index Medicus on 01 July 2019 and manual search. We performed search of studies that have detected common respiratory viruses in children <=18 years with wheezing. We included only studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Study data were extracted and the quality of articles assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroup, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effects model., RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 studies. Rhinovirus, with a prevalence of 35.6% (95% CI 24.6-47.3, I2 98.4%), and respiratory syncytial virus, at 31.0% (95% CI 19.9-43.3, I2 96.4%), were the most common viruses detected. The prevalence of other respiratory viruses was as follows: human bocavirus 8.1% (95% CI 5.3-11.3, I2 84.6%), human adenovirus 7.7% (95% CI 2.6-15.0, I2 91.0%), influenza virus6.5% (95% CI 2.2-12.6, I2 92.4%), human metapneumovirus5.8% (95% CI 3.4-8.8, I2 89.0%), enterovirus 4.3% (95% CI 0.1-12.9, I2 96.2%), human parainfluenza virus 3.8% (95% CI 1.5-6.9, I2 79.1%), and human coronavirus 2.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.4, I2 79.4%)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus may contribute to the etiology of wheezing in children.

{"text": "The COVID-19 pandemic and dentistry: the clinical, legal and economic consequences - part 2: consequences of withholding dental care. As routine care was suspended in most countries, one could anticipate progression of undiagnosed and managed oral disease. Patients are usually unaware of the development of oral disease as it is not visible to them and largely asymptomatic, especially in its early stages. The natural progression of conditions such as caries and periodontitis is inevitable without diagnosis and management. The full extent of patient harm because of the suspension of routine dental care can only be estimated when routine oral examinations are fully re-established, and even then, we will probably never know the number of individuals impacted or the extent of disease progression and harm. In first-world countries, there has always been a back-up emergency treatment system for dental problems. For example, in the UK, the safety net for life-threatening swellings and for acute pain relief is the accident and emergency services. This system remained in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Courts could be expected to understand the coronavirus context and would take this into account should there be a complaint against the clinician about access to care. The suspension of routine dental care to save lives will lead to the closure of many dental practices due to substantial financial impact. The return to routine care will be slow, with prioritisation of non-aerosol generating procedures while we look to further understand methods to mitigate transmission risk via infected aerosol and spatter.

Comprehensive validation in a large cohort of prospectively collected specimens with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status should be performed to evaluate the potential and limitations of saliva-based testing. We developed a saliva-based testing pipeline for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) readouts, and measured samples from 137 outpatients tested at a curbside testing facility and 29 inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19. These measurements were compared to the nasal swab results for each patient performed by a certified microbiology laboratory. We found that our saliva testing positively detects 100% (RT-PCR) and 93.75% (ddPCR) of curbside patients that were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive by the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) certified nasal swab testing assay. Quantification of viral loads by ddPCR revealed an extremely wide range, with 1 million-fold difference between individual patients.

In Brasil, a large part of post-acute care and chronic patients is performed at home through Home Care (HC)., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in Home Care patients and the clinical outcomes of these patients; it also aims to assess the impact of the epidemic on the number of patients, new admissions, and hospitalizations., METHODS: A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period., RESULTS: There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%)., CONCLUSION: Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

This study investigated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and determined the association between various factors, social support, and depression, anxiety, and stress among university healthcare workers in Malaysia after the government lifted the movement control order (MCO) put in place to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remained elevated even after the MCO was lifted.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In this work we present the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 1.5-year-old boy affected by severe Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome with previous history of autoinflammatory disease, occurring 5 months after treatment with gene therapy. Before SARS-CoV-2 infection, the patient had obtained engraftment of gene corrected cells, resulting in WASP expression restoration and early immune reconstitution. The patient produced specific immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 at high titer with neutralizing capacity and experienced a mild course of infection, with limited inflammatory complications, despite pre-gene therapy clinical phenotype.

{"text": "Practice-Level Variation in Telemedicine Use in a Pediatric Primary Care Network During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Analysis and Survey Study. BACKGROUND: Telehealth, the delivery of health care through telecommunication technology, has potential to address multiple health system concerns. Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier to their adoption. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, enabling its integration into primary care pediatrics., OBJECTIVE: Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volumes, child-level variations in telemedicine use, and clinician attitudes toward telemedicine., METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (April 19 to May 2, 2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) rates of in-person visits to the office, urgent care, and the emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use, and (5) clinician attitudes toward telemedicine across these practices., RESULTS: Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28%-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15%-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=.005) but more total encounters overall (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care; however, no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles., CONCLUSIONS: Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus, in the context of the pandemic, when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced or increased differences in use, suggesting that further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.

{"text": "Does social trust slow down or speed up the transmission of COVID-19?. Social trust has been an important mechanism in overcoming crises throughout history. Several societies are now emphasizing its role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate how variations in social trust across 68 countries are related to the transmission speed of COVID-19. Specifically, using cross-national index data from the World Value Survey, the study tests how variations in social trust across countries generate different time durations at which each country reaches the peak in terms of increases in new infections of COVID-19. Using data drawn between December 31, 2019 and July 31, 2020, this study found that in countries with a high level of social trust, particularly trust among ingroup members, or with a narrower or wider range than the intermediate range of trustees, the number of new infections tended to reach the first peak within a shorter time duration than in other countries. These results imply that in such societies, on the one hand, high cooperation among people to achieve common goals and strong compliance to social norms may allow them to begin neutralizing COVID-19 faster. On the other hand, however, the low risk perception and prevalence of cohesive relationships among people may lead to speedier transmission of COVID-19 before neutralization takes place.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Development of a SERS-based lateral flow immunoassay for rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG in clinical samples. The accurate and rapid screening of serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the key to control the spread of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this study, we reported a surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG with high sensitivity. Novel SERS tags labeled with dual layers of Raman dye were fabricated by coating a complete Ag shell on SiO2 core (SiO2@Ag) and exhibited excellent SERS signals, good monodispersity, and high stability. Anti-human IgM and IgG were immobilized onto the two test lines of the strip to capture the formed SiO2@Ag-spike (S) protein-anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG immunocomplexes. The SERS signal intensities of the IgM and IgG test zones were easily recorded by a portable Raman instrument and used for the high-sensitivity analysis of target IgM and IgG. The limit of detection of SERS-LFIA was 800 times higher than that of standard Au nanoparticle-based LFIA for target IgM and IgG. The SERS-LFIA biosensor was tested on 19 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 49 negative serum samples from healthy people to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of our proposed assay. The results revealed that the proposed method exhibited high accuracy and specificity for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.

{"text": "Diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection: Preliminary results of six serology tests. The most important use of serology in the COVID-19 diagnostics is for determination of the extent of disease in the population. However, immunoassays could represent an additional diagnostic method, especially in patients with exposure history and clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19 who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR. We analyzed the preliminary results of six serology tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Three point-of-care lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays (POC): ACRO, AMP and ENCODE and three enzyme immunoassays (ELISA): DiaPro, Vircell and Euroimmun were used. A total of 15 serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 15 serum samples from asymptomatic persons were tested. Time of sampling for COVID-19 patients was 4 - 10 days (N=4), 11 - 19 days (N=6) and 20 - 34 days (N=5) after disease onset. Initially reactive results were confirmed using a virus neutralization test (VNT). In COVID-19 patients (N=15), IgM/IgA positive detection rates were 9/60.0% (ACRO), 11/73.3% (AMP, ENCODE, Euroimmun), 12/80.0% (DiaPro) and 13/86.6% (Vircell). Overall IgG detection rates were 10//66.6% (AMP, Euroimmun) and 11/73.3% (other tests). According to the sampling time, positive detection rates were as follows: a) days 4 - 10: 1/25.0% and 2/50.0% (IgM/IgA and IgG); b) days 11 -19: 4/66.6%-6/100% (IgM/IgA), 4/66.6% and 5/83.3% (IgG); c) days 20 - 34: 4/80.0% and 5/100% (IgM/IgA), 5/100% (IgG). One asymptomatic participant tested IgM/IgA positive using ACRO, DiaPro and Vircell was confirmed seropositive using a VNT. In a group of asymptomatic persons detected seronegative using a VNT (N=14), IgM/IgA negative detection rates were 12/85.7% (ACRO), 13/92.8% (DiaPro, Vircell) and 14/100% (AMP, ENCODE, Euroimmun). IgG negative detection rates were 13/92.8% (ACRO) and 14/100% (other tests).

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide, with millions of cases and more than 1 million deaths to date. The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. Upon challenge using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, virus loads in vaccinated mice were significantly lower, while vaccinated Syrian hamsters revealed protection in a harsh challenge setup using an early-passage human patient isolate.

The cost of the campaign, including the development of the vaccine was substantial, in excess of $200M, but it contributed to a reduced incidence of meningococcal infections along with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The campaign led to the development of a national immunisation register (NIR), which is still in existence today. As well as considering the legacies of the MeNZB vaccination programme, this paper examines whether there are any lessons to be learned, specifically concerning active vaccine safety monitoring, which may be important if, and when, a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and a national immunisation campaign instituted.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Rationale: To analyze the evolution of the nutritional status of Elementary School children, over four years, and to infer the impact of nutritional imbalances to child infection susceptibility. Method(s): A convenience sample of two elementary schools were studied during 4 school years, starting in 2016/2017. Weight and height were collected. Body mass index (BMI) z-score was calculated using the WHO AnthroPlus software. Nutritional status was evaluated according to WHO guidelines. Result(s): 1155 students (6 - 14 years-old, 48.5% female) were included. The mean z-scores of each year were: 0.43 +/-1.17 in 2016/2017, 0.70 +/-1.31 in 2017/2018, 0.38 +/-1.30 in 2018/2019, and 0.34 +/-1.86 in 2019/2020. The 2019/2020 school year recorded the highest percentage of underweight (10%), the highest percentage of normal weight was recorded in 2016/2017 (67.2%), 2017/2018 registered the highest percentage of overweight (24.6%) and the highest percentage of obesity was registered in 2019/2020 (18.2%). In these 4 years there has been an increase in the percentage of underweight (2.2% to 10%) and obesity (8.1% to 18.2%) and a decrease in the percentage of normal weight (67.2% to 54.6%) and overweight (22.5% to 17.1%). Conclusion(s): The increase in the prevalence of underweight and obesity between 2016 and 2020 is worrying, mainly during a pandemic that has obesity and malnutrition as risk factors. Also, the decrease in the prevalence of overweight may be related to conversion of these cases into obesity cases, since normal weight cases also decreased. We are implementing a nutrition education program in these schools to try reverting this serious public health problem, although facing some resistance. Therefore, nutritionists are needed in Portuguese schools, to promote health and nutrition literacy among students, especially during pandemic times.

It is necessary and constructive to compare and analyze COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help clinicians to have a potential option for COVID-19. Evidence Acquisition: In this study, eight databases were searched on May 1, 2020, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and Cochrane Library, with the search fields of \"Title Abstract Keyword\"of \"Convalescent plasma AND COVID-19\"or \"Convalescent plasma AND SARS-CoV-2\". The outcome of interest was clinical RCTs for COVID-19. Result(s): The search retrieved nine relevant CCP protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). All nine trials were randomized, parallel assignment, interventional, clinical treatment studies with NCT04344535, NCT04345289, and NCT04323800 masking and the rest open-label. The estimated enrollment is within the range of 40-1,500 subjects, and five trials will be finished in 2020 as opposed to two in 2021 and two in 2022. Except for NCT04323800 on the prevention of COVID-19, other eight trials will test and verify the effectiveness and safety of CCP for the treatment of COVID-19. The used dosage of CCP is within the range of 200-600 mL. NCT04344535, NCT04323800, and NCT04346446 use standard donor plasma in controlled groups in comparison to NCT04348656, NCT04342182, NCT04333251, and NCT04345523 without any positive drug in controlled groups. NCT04332835 adds hydroxychloroquine to both groups, and only NCT04345289 is a six-armed placebo-controlled trial. Primary and secondary outcome measures are differently expressed in the nine trials. Nevertheless, they can be summarized as changes in time, day, and number of a 7-point ordinal scale. There are changes in SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (i.e., viral load), anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (i.e., immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G), C-reactive protein, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin 6 on a specified day or during a specific period. Conclusion(s): The nine well-designed RCT trials will establish the efficacy of CCP for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of evidence-based medicine.

{"text": "Potential and demonstrated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexually transmissible infections. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review considers the potential and demonstrated impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the sexually transmissible infection (STI)/HIV transmission., RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities., SUMMARY: In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

{"text": "Antibody tests for diagnosing COVID-19: how relevant are they?. The current standards for detecting active coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection are molecular tests by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, using swabs from the lower or upper respiratory tract. Because of the expertise required and the long turnaround time for the availability of test results, faster and easier point-of-care methods are necessary. The latter may include the detection of antibodies specific to COVID-19. We highlight a recent Cochrane review that assessed the accuracy of antibody tests for diagnosing COVID-19. The review shows that, at present, antibodies have little use in the diagnosis of COVID-19 within the first seven days from onset of symptoms. However, as time progresses, the sensitivity of the antibody tests increases. Antibody tests are more useful in detecting previous COVID-19 infection if used 15 days or more from onset of symptoms. Data presented in the review should be interpreted with caution as most studies (85%) recruited in-hospital patients and 11% recruited suspected COVID-19 patients, while only 4% recruited convalescent patients. This limits generalisability of the results to most settings. Copyright: Muki Shehu Shey et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Differential effects of antiseptic mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting a potential benefit from the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load and reduce virus spread. Published studies on reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by antiseptics do not exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and of a non-pathogenic, recombinant, SARS-CoV-2 infection vector (pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus). We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). Potent anti-viral activities of povidone iodine and Colgate peroxyl mouth rinses was the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts anti-viral activity. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated-viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Prolonged incubation of virus with mouth rinses was not required for viral inactivation. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread., Importance: SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting the potential necessity for the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load to reduce virus spread. Published studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of antiseptics determined by virus-induced cytotoxic effects cannot exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. We found that all mouth rinses tested inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Listerine and CHG were less cytotoxic than Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine and were active against the virus. When mouth rinses were present in the cell culture during the infection, the potent anti-viral effect of mouth rinses were in part due to the mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that assessing anti-viral candidates including mouth rinses with minimal potential disruption of cells may help identify active agents that can reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Breath biomarkers of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection: a pilot study. COVID-19 control efforts have been hampered by transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV2. Prolonged asymptomatic respiratory viral shedding in children has been described and may be another important reservoir for ongoing transmission. The primary diagnostic approach to identify SARS-CoV2 infection relies on qPCR of specific viral sequences from respiratory samples, which is expensive, uncomfortable, relatively slow, and susceptible to false-negative results. A rapid non-invasive method to detect mild or asymptomatic infection would have a major impact on public health campaigns to control COVID-19. We hypothesize that candidate biomarkers characterize the exhaled breath of children with SARS-CoV2 infection. To test this hypothesis, we enrolled SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected children admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center and analyzed their breath volatile composition. Targeted volatiles analysis revealed that six volatile organic compounds increased significantly in SARS-CoV-2-infected children. Three aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, and heptanal) drew special attention as candidate biomarkers, because viral infections have previously been shown to induce aldehyde production. Together, these biomarkers demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 66.6% specificity.

{"text": "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction Before and During COVID in New York. Little is known about regional differences in volume, treatment, and outcomes of STEMI patients undergoing PCI during the pandemic. The objectives of this study were to compare COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods with respect to regional volumes, outcomes, and treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) between 01/01/19-3/14/20 (pre-COVID period) and between 3/15/20-4/25/20 (COVID period) in 51 New York State hospitals certified to perform PCI. The hospitals were classified as being in either high-density or low-density COVID-19 counties on the basis of deaths/10,000 population. There was a decrease of 43% in procedures/week in high-density COVID-19 counties (P < 0.0001) and only 4% in low-density counties (P=0.64). There was no difference in the change in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rates in either type of county, but STEMI PCI patients in high-density counties had longer times from symptom onset to hospital arrival and lower cardiac arrest rates in the pandemic period. In conclusion, the decrease in STEMI PCIs during the pandemic was mainly limited to counties with a high density of COVID-19 deaths. The decrease appears to be primarily related to patients not presenting to hospitals in high-density COVID regions, rather than PCI being avoided among STEMI patients or a reduction in the incidence of STEMI. Also, high-density COVID-19 counties experienced delayed admissions and less severely ill STEMI PCI patients during the pandemic. This information can serve to focus efforts on convincing STEMI patients to seek life-saving hospital care during the pandemic. Copyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "[Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare Personnel in Cameroon]. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon., METHOD: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020., RESULT: The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers., DISCUSSION: The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Evaluation of current diagnostic methods for COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which triggers lung failure, pneumonia, and multi-organ dysfunction. This enveloped, positive sense and single-stranded RNA virus can be transmitted through aerosol droplets, direct and indirect contacts. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has reached a pandemic level in a few months. Since COVID-19 has caused numerous human casualties and severe economic loss posing a global threat, the development of readily available, accurate, fast, and cost-effective diagnostic techniques in hospitals and in any places where humans spread the virus is urgently required. COVID-19 can be diagnosed by clinical findings and several laboratory tests. These tests may include virus isolation, nucleic acid-based molecular assays like real-time polymerase chain reactions, antigen or antibody-based immunological assays such as rapid immunochromatographic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunofluorescence techniques, and indirect fluorescent antibody techniques, electrochemical sensors, etc. However, current methods should be developed by novel approaches for sensitive, specific, and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 cases to control and prevent this outbreak. Thus, this review will cover an overview and comparison of multiple reports and commercially available kits that include molecular tests, immunoassays, and sensor-based diagnostic methods for diagnosis of COVID-19.

Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus, significantly impacting Germany among other countries since its emergence. Because of heterogeneous symptoms and a subset of patients even being asymptomatic at presentation, fast identification of infected patients remains challenging., Objective: The goal of this study is the evaluation of different patient groups with a focus on symptoms and pre-existing illness at admission, as this is important for initial assessment and adequate emergency care., Methods: COVID-19 positive patients at the University Hospital Heidelberg were retrospectively analyzed for disease history and symptoms at the initial presentation as well as mortality. The authors obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval by the Ethics Committee (Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University) prior to commencing the study., Results: Dyspnea was more common in patients admitted to intermediate care/intensive care units (48 vs 13%, P<0.001) and showed a significantly higher percentage in the deceased (91 vs 48%, P=0.004). The symptoms of all presenting patients were highly variable, and many manifestations commonly associated with COVID-19 like cough, fever, and sore throat were only detected in a subset of patients, 60%, 43%, and 33%, respectively., Conclusion: Dyspnea was present significantly more often in patients dying of COVID-19 compared to all patients admitted to the IMC/ICU, necessitating adequate observation and monitoring. In all presenting patients, initial symptoms showed large variation; therefore, COVID should be considered as a main differential diagnosis at every patient presentation, and patients with high pre-test probability should, if possible, be isolated until testing results are known.

{"text": "The role of Interleukin-6 in the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of severe COVID-19. A newly identified virus appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 presents similarities with two previous coronavirus pandemics, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV, concerning phylogenetic origin, structural composition, and clinical symptoms, thus, leading to common pathogenic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to declare the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 by comparing its effect on SARS-CoV and MERS cases. Increased levels of IL-6 comprise the key for the stimulation of cytokine storm and the progression of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cases. Especially, in COVID-19 patients, the overactivation of NF-kBeta, which is caused by the binding of coronavirus spike protein S to alveolar epithelial cells, up-regulates IL-6 and promotes its systematic circulation, causing alveolar damage and extrapulmonary injury. Additionally, IL-6 can be used to evaluate respiratory failure and identify asymptomatic patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-6 signaling, comprises a remedial option against COVID-19. TCZ improves oxygenation, reduces fever, and decreases levels of IL-6. IL-6 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 and may be used as a therapeutic target against COVID-19. However, further research is needed concerning the relation of IL-6 in COVID-19 cases and more clinical trials are required to declare TCZ as a treatment option.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in December 2019 and has been rapidly escalating throughout the world. Clinical findings show that the patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 can be a potential source of infection. Although respiratory droplets and close contact are considered to be the main routes of transmission, there is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment. The nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces, urine and so on, but whether it exists in the semen has not been confirmed. It is reported that the novel coronavirus may affect the testis that highly expresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and theoretically the semen is a possible carrier of the virus considering the fact that it is discharged from the same channel as the urine. Andrology laboratorians are exposed to most of the specimens above, including semen, and some open operations in the laboratory increase the risk of aerosol generation. Therefore, corresponding protective procedures are necessitated in andrology laboratories to reduce the risk of infection during the outbreak of COVID-19.

{"text": "D614G Spike Mutation Increases SARS CoV-2 Susceptibility to Neutralization. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form. To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates, and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD \"up\" conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization.

Over the past decade, pandemics caused by pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza virus in 2009 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 have emerged. Both are high-impact respiratory pathogens originating from animals. Their wide distribution in the human population subsequently results in an increased risk of human-to-animal transmission: reverse zoonosis. Although there have only been rare reports of reverse zoonosis events associated with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 so far, comparison with the pH1N1 influenza pandemic can provide a better understanding of the possible consequences of such events for public and animal health. The results of our review suggest that similar factors contribute to successful crossing of the host species barriers in both pandemics. Specific risk factors include sufficient interaction between infected humans and recipient animals, suitability of the animal host factors for productive virus infection, and suitability of the animal host population for viral persistence. Of particular concern is virus spread to susceptible animal species, in which group housing and contact network structure could potentially result in an alternative virus reservoir, from which reintroduction into humans can take place. Virus exposure in high-density populations could allow sustained transmission in susceptible animal species. Identification of the risk factors and serological surveillance in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible animal species that are group-housed should help reduce the threat from reverse zoonosis of COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected the psychological well-being and mental health of many people. Data on prevalence rates of mental health problems are needed for mental health service planning. Psychological well-being and prevalence of clinically significant mental distress were measured in a large sample from Wales 11-16 weeks into lockdown and compared to population-based data collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using an online survey disseminated across Wales and open to adults (age 16+) from 9th June to 13th July 2020. Psychological well-being was indexed via the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, and psychological distress was indexed via the K10. Data from 12,989 people who took part in this study were compared to that from April 2018 - March 2019, gathered by the National Survey for Wales (N = 11,922). Well-being showed a large decrease from 2019 levels. Clinically significant psychological distress was found in around 50% of the population (men = 47.4%, women = 58.6%), with around 20% showing \"severe\" effects (men = 17.0%, women = 20.9%): a 3-4-fold increase in prevalence.

The impact of COVID-19 on public health and the global economy has led to an unprecedented research response, with a major emphasis on the development of safe vaccines and drugs. However, effective, safe treatments typically take over a decade to develop and there are still no clinically approved therapies to treat highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Repurposing of known drugs can speed up development and this strategy, along with the use of biologicals (notably monoclonal antibody therapy) and vaccine development programmes remain the principal routes to dealing with the immediate impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the development of broadly-effective highly potent antivirals should be a major longer term goal. Structural biology has been applied with enormous effect, with key proteins structurally characterised only weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was released.

Here, we determined a crystal structure of the COVA1-16 antibody fragment (Fab) with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and negative-stain electron microscopy reconstructions with the spike glycoprotein trimer to elucidate the structural basis of its cross-reactivity. COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly through a long complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3, and competes with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor because of steric hindrance rather than epitope overlap. COVA1-16 binds to a flexible up conformation of the RBD on the spike and relies on antibody avidity for neutralization. These findings, along with the structural and functional rationale for epitope conservation, provide insights for development of more universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines and therapies.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread globally since December 2019 from Wuhan, China. Headache has been observed as one of the clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify studies published between December 2019 and March 2020. Adult (>=18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020182529). Results: We identified 2,055 studies, of which 86 studies (n = 14,275, 49.4% female) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of headache in COVID-19 patients was 10.1% [95% CI: 8.76-11.49]. There was no significant difference of headache prevalence in severe or critical vs. non-severe (RR: 1.05, p = 0.78), survived (recovered or discharged) vs. non-survived (RR: 1.36, p = 0.23), and ICU vs. non-ICU (RR: 1.06, p = 0.87) COVID-19 patients. We detected 64.0, 34.9, and 1.1% of the included studies as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively. Conclusions: From the first 4-month data of the outbreak, headache was detected in 10.1% of the adult COVID-19 patients.

The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research including several clinical trials, currently there are no completely safe or effective therapeutics to cure the disease.

The photothermal nanoparticle is comprised of a semiconducting polymer core and a biocompatible polyethylene glycol surface decorated with neutralizing antibodies. Such nanoparticles displayed efficient capture of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, excellent photothermal effect, and complete inhibition of viral entry into ACE2-expressing host cells via simultaneous blocking and inactivating of the virus. This photothermal nanoparticle is a flexible platform that can be readily adapted to other SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and extended to novel therapeutic proteins, thus providing a broad range of protection against multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Patients with statin exposure were more often men and had a greater prevalence of comorbidities. The median follow-up was 44 days. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and comorbidities, statin exposure was not associated with a significantly different risk of mortality (HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.18); 30-day standardised absolute risk (SAR), 9.8% (8.7% to 11.0%) vs 9.5% (8.2% to 10.8%); SAR difference, -0.4% (-1.9% to 1.2%)), severe COVID-19 infection (HR 1.16 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.41); 30-day SAR, 13.0% (11.8% to 14.2%) vs 14.9% (12.8% to 17.1%); SAR difference, 1.9% (-0.7% to 4.5%)), and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality or severe COVID-19 infection (HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23); 30-day SAR, 17.6% (16.4% to 18.8%) vs 18.2% (16.4% to 20.1%); SAR difference, 0.6% (-1.6% to 2.9%)).

{"text": "Impact of low serum calcium at hospital admission on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. BACKGROUND: Calcium is an essential ion for pathogen survival and virulence and is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Hypocalcemia is a common laboratory finding in critically ill patients. Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with hypocalcemia could have a worse outcome., METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72 hours since hospital admission. Main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support - defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation-, intensive care unit admission or death., RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the study. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-74), 65% were men. Hypocalcemia within 72 hours since hospital admission was present in 63% of patients. A higher number of patients in the hypocalcemia group required high oxygen support during hospitalization (49% vs 32%; p = 0,01) and were admitted to the ICU (42% vs 26%; p = 0,005). No differences in mortality were observed between groups., CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia is frequent in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and can identify patients with worse outcome.

Objective: Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland that causes destructive thyrotoxicosis and is attributed to a viral or post-viral response. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that caused a global pandemic in 2020. We present a case that suggests that there may be a relationship between SAT and corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)., Methods: We describe the clinical findings, thyroid function tests, and neck ultrasound of a patient presenting with anterior neck pain., Results: A 47-year-old, Filipino female presented with anterior neck pain associated with neck tenderness and goiter. She did not have fever or respiratory symptoms but had right lower lobe pneumonia on chest radiograph. Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.05 muIU/mL (reference range is 0.47 to 4.68 muIU/mL), free thyroxine of 1.68 pg/mL (reference range is 0.78 to 2.19 pg/mL), and total triiodothyronine of 1.4 ng/mL (reference range is 0.97 to 1.69 ng/mL).

{"text": "The Acquisition of Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria in Patients Admitted to COVID-19 Intensive Care Units: A Monocentric Retrospective Case Control Study. Whether the risk of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) acquisition in the intensive care unit (ICU) is modified by the COVID-19 crisis is unknown. In this single center case control study, we measured the rate of MDRB acquisition in patients admitted in COVID-19 ICU and compared it with patients admitted in the same ICU for subarachnoid hemorrhage (controls) matched 1:1 on length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation. All patients were systematically and repeatedly screened for MDRB carriage. We compared the rate of MDRB acquisition in COVID-19 patients and in control using a competing risk analysis. Of note, although we tried to match COVID-19 patients with septic shock patients, we were unable due to the longer stay of COVID-19 patients. Among 72 patients admitted to the COVID-19 ICUs, 33% acquired 31 MDRB during ICU stay. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. Antimicrobial therapy and exposure time were associated with higher rate of MDRB acquisition. Among the 72 SAH patients, 21% acquired MDRB, with an incidence density was 18/1000 patient days. The septic patients had more comorbidities and a greater number of previous hospitalizations than the COVID-19 patients. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. The association between COVID-19 and MDRB acquisition (compared to control) risk did not reach statistical significance in the multivariable competing risk analysis (sHR 1.71 (CI 95% 0.93-3.21)).

{"text": "COVID-19 Pandemic and Thalassemia Major Patients: Transfusion Practice and Treatment Assessment. BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 epidemic occurred for the first time in December 2019, the governments worldwide took some restriction measures for slowing the spread of novel coronavirus. Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated., RESULTS: In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.9+/-6.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.14+/-0.77 g/dL and 8.87+/- 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients., CONCLUSION: Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided. The results of the SF level showed that the management of chelation therapy should be more meticulous. However, we should be ready for the challenges in the transfusion practice of patients with TM due to fluctuations in the COVID-19 pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

All health maintenance organization enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the subjects with negative and positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and between COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive subjects with and without asthma were analyzed., RESULTS: A total of 37,469 subjects were tested for COVID-19 RT-PCR, and results for 2,266 (6.05%) of them were positive. A significantly higher proportion of smokers was observed in the COVID-19-negative group than in the COVID-19-positive group (4734 [13.45%] vs 103 [4.55%]; P < .001).

{"text": "Prevalence of autoantibody responses in acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immunopathology may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus-Induced Disease-19 (COVID-19). Immune-mediated tissue damage could result from development of rapid autoimmune responses, characterized by production of self-reactive autoantibodies. In this study, we tested specimens from acutely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for autoantibodies against nuclear, vasculitis-associated, and phospholipid antigens. Detectable autoantibodies were present in 30% of the patients in our cohort, with the majority of reactive specimens demonstrating antibodies to nuclear antigens. However, antinuclear antibodies were only weakly reactive and directed to single antigens, as is often seen during acute infection. We identified strongly reactive antibodies to nuclear antigens only in patients with a prior history of autoimmune disease. In our cohort, the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was low, and we did not detect any vasculitis-associated autoantibodies. We found similar levels of inflammatory markers and total immunoglobulin levels in autoantibody positive versus negative patients, but anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were increased in autoantibody positive patients. Together, our results suggest that acute COVID-19 is not associated with a high prevalence of clinically significant autoantibody responses of the type usually associated with autoimmune rheumatic disease.

Herein, we aimed to determine patient-perceived seizure control during the surge, specific variables associated with worsened seizures, the prevalence of specific barriers to care, and patient-perceived efficacy of epilepsy care delivered via telephone and live video visits during the pandemic., METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study of adult epilepsy patients who had a scheduled appointment at a single urban Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (Montefiore Medical Center) between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bronx. Subjects able to answer the questionnaire themselves in English or Spanish were eligible to complete a one-time survey via telephone or secure online platform (REDCap)., RESULTS: Of 1212 subjects screened, 675 were eligible, and 177 adequately completed the questionnaire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 75.1% of patients reported no change in seizure control, whereas 17.5% reported that their seizure control had worsened, and 7.3% reported improvement. Subjects who reported worsened seizure control had more frequent seizures at baseline, were more likely to identify stress and headaches/migraines as their typical seizure precipitants, and were significantly more likely to report increased stress related to the pandemic. Subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 did not report worsened seizure control. Nearly 17% of subjects reported poorer epilepsy care, and 9.6% had difficulty obtaining their antiseizure medications; these subjects were significantly more likely to report worse seizure control., SIGNIFICANCE: Of the nearly 20% of subjects who reported worsened seizure control during the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and barriers to care appear to have posed the greatest challenge. This unprecedented pandemic exacerbated existing and created new barriers to epilepsy care, which must be addressed.

Presentation: A septuagenarian male experienced sudden frightening onset of severe headache, marked nausea and vomiting, pharyngitis, severe upper respiratory congestion, fever, chills, weakness, malaise, and mild pulmonary congestion. O2 saturation=96%. Presumptive-diagnosis: \"Covid-19\". Treatment: Nausea and vomiting continued without respite for several hours. Anti-nausea tablets were twice regurgitated intact. Accordingly, treatment was initiated with 30 mg of the SOD-mimetic antioxidant drug Tempol PO as the hydroxylamine in a 6% water solution containing 90 mg vitamin-C. Patient kept this down. Along with Tempol-zinc gargles for pharyngitis, intranasal treatment was then initiated with a medication-soaked cotton swab and insufflation, repeated q 6h as symptoms returned. This was followed by similar doses of Tempol-H three and six hours later, repeated BID PO for the next ten days. On days 2-3, treatment was briefly initiated with hydroxychloroquine, zinc, doxycycline, ivermectin, and famotidine, then withdrawn. Result(s): Within one-hour post-Tempol-H, vomiting ceased, headache eased significantly, and the patient felt objectively better. Nasal congestion also reversibly eased upon intranasal treatment. By days 5-7 remaining symptoms were mild reversible-on-treatment nasal congestion, pharyngitis, and malaise. Excepting slight malaise, patient was essentially asymptomatic by days 8-9. As expected, PCR was negative day 10. Although the diagnosis is reasonably sure, IgG was negative at days 11 and 58. Conclusion(s): The usual objections to N=1 case-reports apply. However, the almost immediate relief of gastrointestinal symptomology was striking and arguably reflects some direct action of Tempol-H on coronavirus-infected gastric mucosa, as does the effect on nasal mucosa. Minimally, Tempol/Tempol-H may be used with relative safely and arguable effectiveness in presumptive early Covid-19. Similarly, we have used Tempol without incident for decades, e.g., for treatment of fibrocystic disease, breast cancer prophylaxis, respiratory infections, and for alopecia, a classic redox-signaling-mediated process.

Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes are known to be associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and resultant mortality. In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. Method(s): We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. Result(s): The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, p = 0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5-41.2, p = 0.2).

{"text": "A Patient with Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Presented 86 Days Later with COVID-19 Pneumonia Possibly Due to Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has radically changed the world, and promising vaccine trials are currently underway. The immune responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still under investigation, and data are evolving. While it is known that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are elicited, it is uncertain whether these responses protect against reinfection or that they provide definitive evidence of viral clearance. Very few cases have been reported in the literature regarding reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT We present a case of a middle-aged man with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection who later developed mild symptomatic COVID-19 after a period of 3 months. The source of reinfection was likely from the community, which had a soaring burden of infection with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million in the world at that time. The patient had 2 negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 2 weeks after the initial infection. During the second infection, a nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription PCR test and tests for the presence of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were all positive. CONCLUSIONS Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is a strong possibility. This case raises concerns that asymptomatic infections may not provide long-term protective immunity to all patients, which could make them susceptible to reinfection. Possible explanations for reinfection include an interval decrease in protective antibodies titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be more prevalent in patients who had an asymptomatic infection. Other possibilities include viral reactivation after a prolonged carriage of the virus or delayed immune response.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Biventricular Takotsubo Syndrome with COVID-19 in an Asian Male. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to affect the cardiovascular system, and several cases of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) induced by COVID-19 have been reported. TTS predominantly affects postmenopausal women in western countries, but the prevalence in men is higher in Asian populations. It should be noted that male patients with either TTS or COVID-19 are associated with higher mortality. Despite the higher prevalence of TTS in Asian men, little is known about Asian men with TTS induced by COVID-19. This is a case report of a 60-year-old Asian male with biventricular TTS precipitated by COVID-19. He presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic shock, and acute kidney injury. He required intubation, multiple vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 15%, but it normalized in 5 weeks. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay in a critical condition, but was eventually discharged alive. The scarce literature about this condition in Asian male populations and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Asian countries highlight the rarity and importance of this case. Further studies are warranted to investigate the uneven sex distribution and outcomes of TTS triggered by COVID-19 in an Asian population.

This study aims to find out the perception and approaches of Indian oncologists - which might prove to be useful in nation specific delivery of cancer care during COVID Pandemic. Method(s): After taking consent, a survey form was circulated online amongst oncologists (haemato/ radiation/ medical/ surgical) across the country and responses collected. Result(s): 79.2% oncologists represent private sector, 16.8% government sector. 50% oncologists were willing to postpone investigations for stable cancer patients. 42.6% willing to start treatment without knowing the COVID status, while 44.6% were against the idea and 12.9% were indecisive. 73% willing to perform surgery right away for operable nonemergency cases with a negative COVID status and rest 27 % willing to postpone surgery. Concurrent Chemoradiation (57%) was preferred over sequential approach (43%). Majority (53.5%) were comfortable prescribing chemotherapy via telemedicine. Asymptomatic COVID positive patients requiring chemotherapy 64.4% were willing to wait for the virus to resolve and then start therapy and 35.6% were suggesting some form of oral therapy and ongoing isolation. 89.1% preferred oral route if option present. 83.7 % preferred targeted therapy, 8.2% immunotherapy and rest went for other options. 93.1 % preferred day care chemotherapy during COVID and not admission. 61 % thought extended course of dexamethasone given as premedication during chemotherapy did not have a protective role for patients during COVID outbreak. Treatment initiation criteria in descending order - 39.6% stage of the disease, 36.6 % performance status, 22.8% COVID status and for rest it was the cost. 91% oncologists thought nurses were at a higher risk of exposure to COVID infection than the doctors. 54.5% were not taking anti COVID prophylaxis.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is still spreading, finding out the initial hits of viral infection is important to minimize the mild/moderate population, prevent disease aggravation and organs dysfunction. Objective: We investigated COVID-19 patients with different serum calcium levels., DESIGN: We checked the serum calcium level of the patients based on days after symptom onset as well as the severity of COVID-19. We also checkeed multi-organ injuries and immune cytokines level in their blood., RESULTS: Both mild/moderate and severe critical cases we observed showed low calcium level in the early stage of viral infection, while the severe/critical cases showed significant lower calcium level than mild/moderate cases in the early stage. We also found that low calcium level related to severe/critical multi-organ injuries especially in the mild/moderate population. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 also correlated to calcium change in both mild/moderate and severe/critical cases., CONCLUSIONS: Our finding indicates that calcium balance is a primal hit of COVID-19 and a biomarker of clinical severity at the beginning of symptom onset.

{"text": "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of angiotensin II receptor signaling in epithelial cells. Cytokine storm is suggested as one of the major pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the mechanism for initiation of a hyper-inflammatory response, and multi-organ damage from viral infection is poorly understood. In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-kappaB and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in epithelial cells promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of the AT1 axis to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has drawn the attention of researchers and clinicians from several disciplines and sectors who are trying to find durable solutions both at preventive and treatment levels. To date, there is no approved effective treatment or vaccine available to control the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The preliminary in vitro studies on viral infection models showed potential antiviral activities of type I and III interferons (IFNs), chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and azithromycin (AZM); however, the clinical studies on COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ and AZM led to controversies in different regions due to their adverse side effects, as well as their combined treatment could prolong the QT interval. Interestingly, the treatment with type I IFNs showed encouraging results. Moreover, the different preliminary reports of COVID-19 candidate vaccines showcase promising results by inducing the production of a high level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and specific T cell-mediated immune response in almost all participants. The present review aims to summarize and analyze the recent progress evidence concerning the use of IFNs, CQ/HCQ, and AZM for the treatment of COVID-19. The available data on immunization options to prevent the COVID-19 are also analyzed with the aim to present the promising options which could be investigated in future for sustainable control of the pandemic.

PURPOSE: To evaluate pooled prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiographic findings for novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHOD(S): We performed systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify articles reporting baseline imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. RESULT(S): Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1-70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1-8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8-72.4%), 44.9% (38.7-51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6-41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%-80%) and 61% (41%-78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%-68%)/ 58% (41%-73%) and 49% (20%-78%)/ 56% (30%-78%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of GGO and consolidation on chest radiograph was 38.7% (22.2%-58.3%) and 46.9% (29.7%-64.9%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of radiographic findings could not be assessed due to small number of studies. CONCLUSION(S): GGO on CT has the highest diagnostic performance for COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only.

The recurrent zoonotic spillover of coronaviruses (CoVs) into the human population underscores the need for broadly active countermeasures. Here, we employed a directed evolution approach to engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. One of the affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) and neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with remarkable potency. Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that ADG-2 employs a unique angle of approach to recognize a highly conserved epitope overlapping the receptor binding site. In murine models of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of ADG-2 provided complete protection against respiratory burden, viral replication in the lungs, and lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents a promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging SARS-like CoVs.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals following diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Further, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be two-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were on average fifteen times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target.

Nevertheless, there has been limited information on the impact of COVID-19 to society's psychological health., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological issues and identify the factors associated with the psychological impact of COVID-19 during the first nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam., METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. A self-administered, online survey was used to collect data and assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants from April 10 to 15, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were utilized to assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants during COVID-19 social distancing.

{"text": "Phenotyping mental health: Age, community size, and depression differently modulate COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. INTRODUCTION: When the first COVID-19 infections were reported in Germany, fear and anxiety spread faster than the pandemic itself. While moderate amounts of fear of a COVID-19 infection may be functional, generalized anxiety and the potentially resulting distress and psychopathology may possibly be detrimental to people's health. Authorities need to avoid a countrywide panic, on the one hand, but foster a realistic awareness of the actual threat, on the other hand., OBJECTIVES: The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate psychological reactions in response to the real or perceived infection threats. In particular, the analysis should reveal whether COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety in times of COVID-19 have distinct correlates., METHODS: A nationwide study was conducted from March 10th to May 4th 2020 in Germany (n = 15,308; 10,824 women, 4433 men, 51 other). Generalized anxiety was assessed using the GAD-7, while COVID-19-related fear was measured using a self-generated item. Both outcome variables were entered into linear regression models. Demographic information, depressive symptoms, trust in governmental interventions, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 and media use were used to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related fear., RESULTS: The data revealed distinct correlates of COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. Although COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety had overlapping predictors, such as neuroticism, they most prominently differed in age distribution and direction of an urban-rural disparity: generalized anxiety decreases with age, but COVID-19-related fear is most pronounced in elderly participants. Generalized anxiety is also more prevalent in rural communities, but COVID-19-related fear is elevated in metropoles. Furthermore, the presence of a risk disease increases COVID-19-related fear, but not generalized anxiety., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COVID-19-related fear is often justified considering the individual risk of infection or complication due to infection. Some of the characteristics that predict COVID-19-related fear leave generalized anxiety unaffected or show divergent predictive directions. The present findings hint toward two related, but discriminant constructs. Copyright \u00a9 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develops within 3-14 days when CoV2 invades epithelial, myeloid cells in the nasopharynx and pneumocytes in the respiratory tract through angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). Infection swiftly disseminates to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal organs as well as immune system to deregulate their normal functioning through unique and distinct mechanisms. The health system and economy has been intensely thwarted by the rapid spread and exorbitant mortality caused by COVID-19 disease across the globe. The acute progression of the disease and high infection rate pose an enormous challenge for its therapeutic management and critical care. The viral structure, genome and proteome have been deciphered which yielded cues for targeting already available therapeutic entities.

Immunosuppression (IS) and autoimmune disease (AD) are prevalent in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their impact on its clinical course is unknown. We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94-3.12; p = 0.081).

The current global fight against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to flatten the transmission curve is put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) as there is no immediate diagnosis or cure for COVID-19 so far. In order to stop the spread, researchers worldwide are working around the clock aiming to develop reliable tools for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) understanding the infection path and mechanisms. Currently, nucleic acid-based molecular diagnosis (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test) is considered the gold standard for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Antibody-based serology detection is ineffective for the purpose of early diagnosis, but a potential tool for serosurveys, providing people with immune certificates for clearance from COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, there are various blooming methods developed these days. In this review, we summarise different types of coronavirus discovered which can be transmitted between human beings. Methods used for diagnosis of the discovered human coronavirus (SARS, MERS, COVID-19) including nucleic acid detection, gene sequencing, antibody detection, antigen detection, and clinical diagnosis are presented. Their merits, demerits and prospects are discussed which can help the researchers to develop new generation of advanced diagnostic tools for accurate and effective control of human coronavirus transmission in the communities and hospitals.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has proved to be an important diagnostic tool throughout the COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks. Increasing number of the infected personnel and shortage of real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as well as its lower sensitivity made the CT a backbone in diagnosis, assessment of severity, and follow-up of the cases. Result(s): Two hundred forty patients were evaluated retrospectively for clinical, laboratory, and radiological expression in COVID-19 infection. One hundred eighty-six non-severe cases with home isolation and outpatient treatment and 54 severe cases needed hospitalization and oxygen support. Significant difference between both groups was encountered regarding the age, male gender, > 38degree fever, dyspnea, chest pain, hypertension, <= 93 oxygen saturation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, elevated D-dimer, high serum ferritin and troponin levels, and high CT-severity score (CT-SS) of the severe group. CT-SS showed a negative correlation with O2 saturation and patients' outcome (r - 0.73/p 0.001 and r - 0.56/p 0.001, respectively). Bilateral peripherally distributed ground glass opacities (GGOs) were the commonest imaging feature similar to the literature. Conclusion(s): Older age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, low O2 saturation, increased CT score, high serum ferritin, and high D-dimer level are the most significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Chronic infectious-immune myocarditis of severe course can potentially be considered as a factor that aggravates the course of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and increases the risk of adverse outcomes. The interaction of chronic myocarditis and COVID-19 during long-term immunosuppressive therapy has not been studied. We present a description of a 35-year-old female patient with chronic infectious-immune myocarditis (morphologically confirmed, with a history of infarction-like onset and thromboembolic complications), who had continuous immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient also received new oral anticoagulants and tenofovir (for chronic HBV infection). COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2 RNA+) was diagnosed in May 2020. Risk factors for the adverse course of coronavirus infection included severe obesity, heart failure, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Correction of immunosuppressive therapy (withdrawal of the cytostatic agent, administration of hydroxychloroquine) and therapy with levofloxacin, an interleukin-17 inhibitor (netakimab) were performed. The severity of pneumonia and respiratory failure was moderate despite high fever and high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood (including interleukin-6). Signs of exacerbation of myocarditis, increased levels of troponin T and anticardial antibodies (compared with the initial ones) were not found. It can be assumed that supportive immunosuppressive therapy for myocarditis has a positive effect on the course of coronavirus pneumonia and avoids exacerbation of myocarditis. Careful continuation of immunosuppressive therapy with temporary withdrawal of aggressive cytostatics can be recommended in chronic myocarditis.

BACKGROUND: Information regarding characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 amongst middle-aged (40-59 years) patients without comorbidities is scarce., METHODS: We therefore conducted this multicentre retrospective study and collected data of middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities at admission from three designated hospitals in China., RESULTS: Among 119 middle-aged patients without comorbidities, 18 (15.1%) developed into severe illness and 5 (3.9%) died in hospital. ARDS (26, 21.8%) and elevated D-dimer (36, 31.3%) were the most common complications, while other organ complications were relatively rare. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe illness associated with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, OR, 11.238; 95% CI 1.110-1.382; p < 0.001) and D-dimer greater than 1 microg/ml (OR, 16.079; 95% CI 3.162-81.775; p = 0.001) on admission. The AUCs for the NLR, D-dimer greater than 1 microg/ml and combined NLR and D-dimer index were 0.862 (95% CI, 0.751-0.973), 0.800 (95% CI 0.684-0.915) and 0.916 (95% CI, 0.855-0.977), respectively.

There was significant difference in the AUC between SOFA and combined index (z = 2.574, p = 0.010)., CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to the monitoring and early treatment of respiratory and coagulation abnormalities in middle-aged COVID-19 patients without comorbidities. In addition, the combined NLR and D-dimer higher than 1 mug/ml index might be a potential and reliable predictor for the incidence of severe illness in this specific patient with COVID-19, which could guide clinicians on early classification and management of patients, thereby relieving the shortage of medical resource.

{"text": "From Influenza Virus to Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2)-The Contribution of Obesity. From the beginning of 2020, the governments and the health systems around the world are tackling infections and fatalities caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a \"cytokine storm\" and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals. We look at the many lessons learnt from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic and relate it to the very little but fast incoming information that is available from the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with overweight and obesity.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Bhattacharya, Ghayor, Perez Dominguez and Weber.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Due to alarming levels of spread and severity, on the 11th of March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak as a global pandemic. As of September 14 2020, more than 29 million cases have been reported, with over 900,000 deaths globally. Since the outbreak, although not conclusive, discoveries have been made regarding the understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, clinical treatment, and prevention of the disease. SARS-COV-2 has been detected in saliva, respiratory fluids, blood, urine, and faeces. Findings are however controversial regarding its presence in the semen or the testis.

OBJECTIVES: Quantitative estimates of the impact of infectious disease outbreaks are required to develop measured policy responses. In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers., DESIGN: Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak., RESULTS: The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo., CONCLUSIONS: Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline.

Background: There is a paucity of data describing the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 on placental pathology, especially in asymptomatic patients. Although the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 is not completely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response and results in a hypercoagulable state with widespread microthrombi. We hypothesized that it is plausible that a similar disease process may occur in the fetal-maternal unit. Objective(s): This study aimed to determine whether coronavirus disease 2019 in term patients admitted to labor and delivery, including women without coronavirus disease 2019 symptomatology, is associated with increased placental injury compared with a cohort of coronavirus disease 2019-negative controls. Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at NYU Winthrop Hospital between March 31, 2020, and June 17, 2020. During the study period, all women admitted to labor and delivery were routinely tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 regardless of symptomatology. The placental histopathologic findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (n=77) who delivered a singleton gestation at term were compared with a control group of term patients without coronavirus disease 2019 (n=56). Controls were excluded if they had obstetrical or medical complications including fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy, or thrombophilia. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for variables that were significant (P<.05) in univariable analyses. A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases with negative controls. Result(s): In univariable analyses, coronavirus disease 2019 cases were more likely to have evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion, that is, presence of avascular villi and mural fibrin deposition (32.5% [25/77] vs 3.6% [2/56], P<.0001) and villitis of unknown etiology (20.8% [16/77] vs 7.1% [4/56], P=.030). These findings persisted in a subgroup analysis of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with coronavirus disease 2019-negative controls. In a multivariable model adjusting for maternal age, race and ethnicity, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and oligohydramnios, the frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion abnormalities remained significantly higher in the coronavirus disease 2019 group (odds ratio, 12.63; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-66.40). Although the frequency of villitis of unknown etiology was more than double in coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with controls, this did not reach statistical significance in a similar multivariable model (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-8.97). All neonates of mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion(s): Despite the fact that all neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, we found that coronavirus disease 2019 in term patients admitted to labor and delivery is associated with increased rates of placental histopathologic abnormalities, particularly fetal vascular malperfusion and villitis of unknown etiology.

In this article, we take the reported cases in India and various states within the country till September 1, as the specimen to understand the progression of the COVID-19. Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19 by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering reported infection primarily due to symptomatic, we compare the model predicted results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would have been much less.

The concurrence of COVID-19 with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) can increase the likelihood of neuromuscular respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, and other life-threatening symptoms. Currently, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, clinical course, and prognostic implications of comorbid COVID-19 in patients with GBS. We reviewed COVID-19-associated GBS case reports published since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a database search up to August 2020, including a manual search of the reference lists for additional relevant cases. Fifty-one (51) case reports of COVID-19 patients (aged 23-84 years) diagnosed with GBS in 11 different countries were included in this review. The results revealed atypical manifestations of GBS, including para-infectious profiles and onset of GBS without antecedent COVID-19 symptoms. Although all tested patients had signs of neuroinflammation, none had SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and only four (4) patients had antiganglioside antibodies. The majority had a 1- to 10-day time interval between the onset of COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, and many had a poor outcome, with 20 out of the 51 (39.2%) requiring mechanical ventilation, and two deaths within 12 to 24 h. The atypical manifestations of COVID-19-associated GBS, especially the para-infectious profile and short time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, increase the likelihood of symptom overlap, which can complicate the treatment and result in worsened disease progression and/or higher mortality rates.

One of the targets that can be affected is the WHO's End TB Strategy goal to eliminate catastrophic costs of TB-affected households by 2030. Disruptions to TB programs and healthcare services due to COVID-19 could potentially prolong diagnostic delays and worsen TB treatment adherence and outcomes. The economic recession caused by the pandemic could significantly impact household financial capacity because of the reduction of income and the rise in unemployment rates. All of these factors increase the risk of TB incidence and the gravity of economic impact on TB-affected households, and hamper efforts to eliminate catastrophic costs and control TB. Therefore, efforts to eliminate the incidence of TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs will be very challenging. Because financial constraint plays a significant role in TB control, the improvement of health and social protection systems is critical.

We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes., RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.94). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%.

The authorities worldwide use clinical science to identify infected people, but this approach is not able to track all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases due to limited sampling capacity of the testing laboratories. This drawback is eliminated by the Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach. In this review, we summarized the peer-reviewed published literature (available as of 28th September 2020), in the field of WBE. The commonly used steps (sampling, storage, concentration, isolation, detection) of the analytical protocols were identified. The potential limitations of each stage of the protocols and good practices were discussed. Finally, new methods for the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 were proposed.

{"text": "Severe COVID-19: A multifaceted viral vasculopathy syndrome. The objective of this study was to elucidate the pathophysiology that underlies severe COVID-19 by assessing the histopathology and the in situ detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and viral capsid proteins along with the cellular target(s) and host response from twelve autopsies. There were three key findings: 1) high copy infectious virus was limited mostly to the alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells of the septal capillaries; 2) viral spike protein without viral RNA localized to ACE2+ endothelial cells in microvessels that were most abundant in the subcutaneous fat and brain; 3) although both infectious virus and docked viral spike protein was associated with complement activation, only the endocytosed pseudovirions induced a marked up-regulation of the key COVID-19 associated proteins IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, p38, IL8, and caspase 3. Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as the expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Spectrum of HRCT findings among asymptomatic and recovered COVID-19 patients: how did they impact the clinical decision?. Background: Decisions about asymptomatic COVID-19 patients are always critical, either during initial screening or during recovery. Spread of infection will be inevitable if those patients were left non-isolated. This study aimed not only to survey spectrum of HRCT findings of COVID-19 among asymptomatic and recovered patients but also to record unexpected results and document their impact upon the clinical decision. Result(s): The study was retrospectively conducted, during June and July 2020, on 120 patients proved with COVID-19, during initial HRCT screening or delayed following announcement of recovery. All patients were completely asymptomatic. They included 72 males and 48 females (60%:40%). Their age ranged from 10 to 58 years (mean 35.95 +/- 12.25 SD). HRCT was analyzed by three expert consultant radiologists in consensus. Among asymptomatic initially screened COVID-19 patients, additional to GGOs, bilateral consolidative changes were unexpectedly found together with secondary fibrosis (23.3% and 10%). HRCT results significantly impacted the clinical decision (P < 0.0001); PCR had to be repeated with home isolation (43.3%). Infected health care providers had to stop their duty immediately (20%). Isolated hospitalization replaced routine ward admission (25%). Cautious surgical interference was performed using full personal protective equipment (PPE) (8.3%). Among asymptomatic recovered COVID-19 patients, unexpected large lesions (> 3 cm) were found (70%). Near 50% of lung volume was persistently affected (10%). Secondary fibrosis was striking (33%). Encysted hydro-pneumothorax persisted for a whole month (1.7%). \"No-isolation\" decision remained unchanged because of clinical and laboratory stability; however, steroids were prescribed to speed lung recovery. Conclusion(s): HRCT findings among asymptomatic and recovered COVID-19 patients can be unexpected and can definitely impact the clinical decision.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America since May 2020, reporting the highest number of cases and deaths in the region. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiencing a significant burden from COVID-19. Identifying and understanding the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with infection are of paramount importance to inform screening strategies and infection control practices in this scenario. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms., METHODS: Between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020 a cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary university hospital in Sao Paulo. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs with COVID-19 symptoms was determined by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. Participants were asked to complete an electronic structured questionnaire including clinical and demographic data., RESULTS: Overall, 125 (42.37%) of 295 symptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Over the 10-week study period, positivity rates varied from 22.2% (95% CI 15.9-60.3%) in the second week to 55.9% (95% CI 43.2-68.6%) in the sixth week, reaching a plateau (38-46%) thereafter. Median (SD) age was 34.2 (9.9) years and 205 (69.5%) were female. We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the most commonly reported underlying medical condition among healthcare workers that tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. After multivariable analysis, using logistic regression, anosmia (adjusted OR 4.4 95% CI 2.21-8.74) and ocular pain (adjusted OR 1.95 95% CI 1.14-3.33) were the only symptoms independently associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Follow-up information on clinical outcomes showed that 9 (7.2%) HCWs were hospitalized (seven were male) and 2 (1.6%) died., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirmed the high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in the hardest hit city by the pandemic in Latin America. Anosmia and ocular pain were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. In low and middle-income countries, where limited availability of tests is frequent, these findings may contribute to optimize a targeted symptom-oriented screening strategy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "The legacy of MeNZB and possible implications for COVID-19 vaccination. It is now over a decade since the meningococcal B vaccine, MeNZB, was in routine use in New Zealand. From July 2004 until June 2008 it was administered in a three-dose schedule to over a million individuals, aged six weeks to 20 years, to provide protection against the epidemic strain of group B Meningococci. The cost of the campaign, including the development of the vaccine was substantial, in excess of $200M, but it contributed to a reduced incidence of meningococcal infections along with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The campaign led to the development of a national immunisation register (NIR), which is still in existence today. As well as considering the legacies of the MeNZB vaccination programme, this paper examines whether there are any lessons to be learned, specifically concerning active vaccine safety monitoring, which may be important if, and when, a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and a national immunisation campaign instituted.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SARS-COV2 and P. falciparum common immunodominant regions may explain low COVID-19 incidence in the malaria-endemic belt. COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality, and new cases are on the rise globally, yet malaria-endemic areas report statistically significant lower incidences. We identified potential shared targets for an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 by immune determinants shared identities with Plasmodium falciparum using IEDB's Immune browser tool 9.0. Probable cross-reactivity is suggested through HLA-A*02:01 and subsequent CD8+ T cell activation. The apparent immunodominant epitope conservation between SARS-COV-2 (N and Orf1ab) and P. falciparum thrombospondin-anonymous-related protein (TRAP) may underlie the low COVID-19 incidence in the malaria-endemic zone by providing immunity against virus infection to those previously infected with plasmodium. Additionally, the shared epitopes lie within antigens which aid in the establishment of the P. falciparum invasion to the erythrocytes may hypothesize an alternative route for SARS-CoV-2, though yet to be proven, via erythrocyte CD147 receptor.

{"text": "Contact Dermatitis from Hand Hygiene Practices in the COVID-19 Pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread globally at a staggering speed. At present, there is no effective treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Hand disinfection is a cost-effective way to prevent its transmission. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, we should wash our hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) with at least 60% alcohol are the alternative. With diligent hand disinfection reinforced during COVID-19, there is an increased prevalence of contact dermatitis. This commentary highlights the fact that contact dermatitis is a readily treatable condition and should not cause any deviation of proper hand hygiene. In irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), the management strategies are selection of less irritating hand hygiene products, frequent use of moisturisers to rebuild the skin barrier, and education on proper hand hygiene practices. In allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the identification and avoidance of the contact allergen is the key to treatment. However, ACD is less common and only accounts for 20% of the cases. The identified allergens in hand cleansers are predominantly preservative excipients and ACD attributable to ABHR are very uncommon. Alcohol-free hand rubs are widely available on the market but it is not a recommended alternative to ABHRs by the CDC.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Convalescent Memory T Cell Immunity in Individuals with Mild or Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection May Result from an Evolutionarily Adapted Immune Response to Coronavirus and the 'Common Cold'. Recent studies have shown a significant level of T cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and unexposed healthy individuals. Also, SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells occur in unexposed healthy individuals from endemic coronaviruses that cause the 'common cold.' The finding of the expression of adaptive SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cells in unexposed healthy individuals may be due to multiple cross-reactive viral protein targets following previous exposure to endemic human coronavirus infections. The opinion of the authors is that determination of protein sequence homologies across seemingly disparate viral protein libraries may provide epitope-matching data that link SARS-CoV-2-reactive T memory cell signatures to prior administration of cross-reacting vaccines to common viral pathogens. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 initiates diverse cellular immune responses, including the associated 'cytokine storm'. Therefore, it is possible that the intact virus possesses a required degree of conformational matching, or stereoselectivity, to effectively target its receptor on multiple cell types. Therefore, conformational matching may be viewed as an evolving mechanism of viral infection and viral replication by an evolutionary modification of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and host cell entry. The authors propose that convalescent memory T cell immunity in individuals with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may result from an evolutionarily adapted immune response to coronavirus and the 'common cold'.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have focused on pregnant women hospitalized due to moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or asymptomatic women diagnosed through universal screening at the time of obstetric admission. Many pregnant women who have symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may not meet criteria for hospitalization; however, whether and how these women can be managed safely in outpatient setting is not well described., Methods: We sought to describe the time to symptom and viral clearance and to identify predictors of hospitalization to better understand the safety of monitoring pregnant patients with symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. We performed a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 illness at a large, academic medical center. Patients had systematic telehealth follow up by a clinician team to assess for symptoms, provide virtual prenatal care, and arrange in-person visits when appropriate in a dedicated outpatient center. Data were collected via chart abstraction., Results: Of 180 pregnant patients presenting with symptoms and undergoing reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, 67 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified during the study period. Nineteen (28%) required acute care given worsening of COVID-19 symptoms, and 95% of these were directed to this acute care setting due to symptom severity telehealth evaluation. Nine women (13%) were admitted to the hospital given worsening symptoms, 3 required intensive care unit care, 2 required ventilatory support, and 2 required delivery. Women with the presenting symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or nausea and vomiting were more likely to require admission. The median duration from initial positive test to RT-PCR viral clearance was 26 days. Disease progression, time to viral clearance, and duration of symptoms did not vary significantly by trimester of infection., Conclusions: Management of the majority of pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 illness can be accomplished in the outpatient setting with intensive and protocol-driven monitoring for symptom progression.

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to affect all aspects of healthcare delivery and neurosurgical practices are not immune to its impact. We aim to evaluate neurosurgical practice patterns as well as perioperative incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients and their outcomes., METHODS: A retrospective review of neurosurgical and neurointerventional cases at two tertiary centers during the first three months of the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic (March 8-June 8) as well as following three months (post-peak pandemic; June 9-September 9) was performed. Baseline characteristics, perioperative COVID-19 test results, modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients through bivariate and multivariate analysis., RESULTS: 652 neurosurgical and 217 neurointerventional cases were performed during post-peak pandemic period. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, functional/pain, cranioplasty, and cerebral angiogram cases were significantly increased in the post-pandemic period. There was a 2.9% (35/1,197) positivity rate for COVID-19 testing overall and 3.6% (13/363) positivity rate postoperatively. Age, mMeNTS score, complications, length of stay, case acuity, ASA status, length of stay, and disposition were significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in elective case volume during the post-peak pandemic period is feasible with low and acceptable incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients. COVID-19 positive patients were younger, less likely to undergo elective procedures, had increased length of stay, had more complications, and were discharged to a location other than home.

Over 20 million children under 5 years old in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have stunted growth, as a result of chronic malnutrition, with damaging long-term consequences for individuals and societies. This review extracted and analyzed data from the UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank malnutrition estimates to present an overall picture of childhood stunting in the region. The number of children under 5 in the region who are affected by stunting has dropped from 24.5 million (40%) in 1990 to 20.6 million (24.2%) in 2019. The reduction rate since the 2012 baseline is only about two fifths of that required and much more rapid progress will be needed to reach the internationally agreed targets by 2025 and 2030. Prevalence is highest in low-income countries and those with a lower Human Development Index. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine efforts to reduce stunting, through its impact on access and affordability of safe and nutritious foods and access to important health services. Priority areas for action to tackle stunting as part of a comprehensive, multisectoral nutrition strategy are proposed. In light of the threat that COVID-19 will exacerbate the already heavy burden of malnutrition in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, implementation of such strategies is more important than ever.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis of the published literature on household SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters (n=213 from 12 countries). Only 8 (3.8%) transmission clusters were identified as having a paediatric index case. Asymptomatic index cases were associated with a lower secondary attack in contacts than symptomatic index cases (estimate risk ratio [RR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.29). To determine the susceptibility of children to household infections the secondary attack rate (SAR) in paediatric household contacts was assessed. The secondary attack rate in paediatric household contacts was lower than in adult household contacts (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91).

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in covid-19 pregnancies and identify factors associated with perinatal viral transmission. Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched to 3 June 2020. Overall, 16 observational studies and 44 case reports/series were included. Fever was the most frequent maternal symptom, followed by cough and shortness of breath, while about 15 % of infected were asymptomatic. Severe disease was estimated to occur in 11 % of women in case reports/series and in 7 % (95 % CI: 4 %-10 %) in observational studies. Two maternal deaths were reported. The rate of neonatal transmission did not differ between women with and without severe disease (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 0.50-7.60). Preterm birth occurred in 29.7 % and 16 % (95 % CI: 11 %-21 %) in data obtained from case series and observational studies, respectively.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a very high transmission disease with a variable prognosis in the general population. Patients in hemodialysis therapy are particularly vulnerable to developing an infectious disease, but the incidence and prognosis of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. The main objective is to describe the experience of our dialysis unit in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection., METHODS: Preventive structural and organizational changes were applied to all patients and health care personnel in order to limit the risk of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection., FINDINGS: The Nephrology department at Sant Joan Despi Moises Broggi Hospital-Consorci Sanitari Integral is a reference for two satellite hemodialysis centers caring for 156 patients. We combine our own hemodialysis maintenance program for 87 patients with hospitalized patients from peripheral hemodialysis centers. In this area, the reported incident rate of COVID-19 in these peripherical hemodialysis centers was 9.5% to 19.9% and the death rate 25% to 30.5%. In our hemodialysis program, the incidence rate was 5.7%. Three out of five required hospitalization (60%) and nobody died., DISCUSSION: Although the risk of local transmission of the disease was very high due to the increase in hemodialysis patients from peripheral centers admitted to hospital, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was very low in our own hemodialysis patients. We believe that the structural and organizational changes adopted early on and the diagnosis algorithm played an important role in minimizing the spread of the disease.

{"text": "Myocardial Injury and Myocarditis in SARS-CoV-2 Patients. Myocarditis is one of the relatively common complications of respiratory infection with SARSCoV-2. As several patients confirmed with the new SARS-CoV-2 are known with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and data from the literature show negative prognosis and a higher risk of complications, this subgroup of subjects represents a particular situation. Therefore, an adequate understanding of the mechanisms involved in myocardial injury and interaction between COVID-19 and CVD is essential for optimal further management. Studies have proved that in COVID-19 patient myocarditis is determined via three pathological mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury: direct viral cell entry and binding to ACE2, vasculitis-mediated injury, and systemic inflammatory response leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine discharge. Studies show that the incidence of myocarditis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low, 4.8%, but myocardial damage occurs in more than 25% of critical cases in the form of acute fulminant myocarditis with severe hemodynamic degradation, or develops when the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection intensifies. The mortality rate in myocarditis from COVID-19 infection ranges between 50-70%, with poorer prognosis and a higher risk of complications in CVD patients. As in all of these cases increased troponin and natriuretic peptide levels proved to be a negative prognostic factor, for risk stratification and prompt treatment, cardiac biomarkers should be evaluated in all patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify the meaning of elevated cardiac troponin in elite soccer athletes previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and screened for cardiovascular involvement in the wake of competitive sport resumption., METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study with the collaboration of two Italian Serie A teams. Soccer players from both rosters (58 athletes) were systematically analysed. For every SARS-CoV-2 positive athlete, the Italian Soccer Federation protocol requested full blood tests including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), along with a complete cardiovascular examination. We extended the analysis to SARS-CoV-2 negative athletes., RESULTS: A total of 13/58 players (22.4%) suffered from SARS-CoV-2infection: all had a negative cardiovascular examination and 2/13 (15%) showed increased hs-cTnI values (120.8 pg/ml and 72,6 pg/ml, respectively; upper reference level 39.2 pg/ml), which did not track with inflammatory biomarkers.

Introduction: The ever-growing number of COVID-19 patients stresses upon the need to identify effective yet readily available predictors of disease severity to ensure better clinical outcomes. D-dimer is a fibrin specific degradation product derived by enzymatic action of plasmin on factor XIIIa cross-linked fibrin. It serves as an ideal marker for activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Identification of coagulopathy as an important complication in COVID-19 patients has brought to focus D-dimer as a possible predictor of clinical severity in patients. Aim(s): In this study, we analysed the role of D-dimer levels in assessing the clinical severity of the COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 217 in-patients of Tirunelveli Medical College in this single centre observational study and classified them into asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe according to \"Clinical Management Protocol: COVID 19\", by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Director General of Health Services. D-dimer was estimated in the separated plasma, using latex based assay using semi automated coagulation analyser. Data were presented as percentages for categorical variables and median+/-Inter Quartile Range (IQR) for continuous variables. Chi-square test was used to compare the D-dimer values between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Among the 217 cases 88.9% were asymptomatic cases, 8.8% presented with mild clinical severity and 2.3% had moderate clinical presentation. In our study population, the Mean+/-SD and Median+/-IQR of D-dimer values (in ng/mL) were 223.4+/-230.6 and 157.0+/-187.7, respectively. The mean D-dimer value was found to increase as the category of our study group ascended from asymptomatic patients to mild and moderate clinical cases. It was noted that 91.1% of the cases who had D-dimer values <500 ng/mL were asymptomatic. Also, the odds of patients with high levels of D-dimer being clinically symptomatic was 5.5 times more than the odds of patients with D-dimer levels <500 ng/mL. Conclusion(s): Elevation of D-dimer levels associated with the severity of clinical course of patients infected with SARS CoV-2 when compared to patients with mild or asymptomatic clinical presentations.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

{"text": "The virology of SARS-CoV-2. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has far-reaching effects on society, the economy and medical treatment. Therefore, it is all the more important to understand the characteristics of the virus and to utilize them in the diagnostics, treatment and epidemiology. This article firstly elucidates the medical significance of coronaviruses in general. Then angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and the possible influence on disease susceptibility are explained. The gold standard for detection of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection is the direct detection of the pathogen with nucleic acid amplification techniques. At the onset of symptoms a swab of the upper airway is especially suitable due to the high viral load. At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or in stool and anal swabs. Antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies is of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated and can only be carried out in secure laboratories (L3). In addition, the importance of these antibodies with respect to immunity against a second infection is uncertain. Thanks to modern techniques thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences are already available, which show a genomic variability. The D614G mutation in the S spikes seems to cause a higher infectiousness. Mutations can impair the diagnostics and treatment, which makes monitoring necessary.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

PURPOSE: To explore the psychological status of infertile women and men who had in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment interrupted or postponed because of the COVID-19 emergency., MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic survey (NCT04400942) was e-mailed between April and June 2020 to couples whose IVF treatments have been interrupted or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The presence and severity of symptoms suggestive of anxiety and/or depression were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Subjects with preexisting psychiatric disorders were excluded., RESULTS: Overall, 524 out of 646 patients completed the survey. The prevalence of anxiety and/or depression feelings was significantly higher in women, mainly if aged more than 35 years and with a previous IVF attempt. The occurrence of these psychological symptoms was significantly associated with the time spent on COVID-19 related news per day and partner with evidence of psychological disorder and, in females, with a diagnosis of poor ovarian reserve, diagnosis of endometriosis or uterine fibroids., CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the infertile couples who should have undergone IVF treatment has been significant.

Population-based prevalence surveys of Covid-19 contribute to establish the burden of infection, the role of asymptomatic and mild infections in transmission, and allow more precise decisions about reopen policies. We performed a systematic review to evaluate qualitative aspects of these studies, assessing their reliability and compiling practices that can influence the methodological quality. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, bioRxiv and medRxiv, and included cross-sectional studies using molecular and/or serological tests to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in the general population. Survey quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies. A correspondence analysis correlated methodological parameters of each study to identify patterns related to higher, intermediate and lower risks of bias. The available data described 37 surveys from 19 countries. The majority were from Europe and America, used antibody testing, and reached highly heterogeneous sample sizes and prevalence estimates. Minority communities were disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Important risk of bias was detected in four domains: sample size, data analysis with sufficient coverage, measurements in standard way and response rate. The correspondence analysis showed few consistent patterns for high risk of bias. Intermediate risk of bias was related to American and European studies, municipal and regional initiatives, blood samples and prevalence >1%. Low risk of bias was related to Asian studies, nationwide initiatives, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests and prevalence <1%.

{"text": "Development and External Validation of a Machine Learning Tool to Rule Out COVID-19 Among Adults in the Emergency Department Using Routine Blood Tests: A Large, Multicenter, Real-World Study. BACKGROUND: Conventional diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (hereafter, PCR) is associated with prolonged time to diagnosis and significant costs to run the test. The SARS-CoV-2 virus might lead to characteristic patterns in the results of widely available, routine blood tests that could be identified with machine learning methodologies. Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients., OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments., METHODS: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged >=20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV)., RESULTS: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%. At the cutoff of 2.0, the NPVs at a prevalence of 1%, 10%, and 20% were 99.9%, 98.6%, and 97%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning model developed with multicenter clinical data integrating commonly collected ED laboratory data demonstrated high rule-out accuracy for COVID-19 status, and might inform selective use of PCR-based testing.

Background: People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters., Methods: We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors., Results: During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with >20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98)., Conclusions: We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

We have previously hypothesized that pentoxifylline could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 given its potential to restore the immune response equilibrium, reduce the impact of the disease on the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, and improve the circulatory function.Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count are accessible biomarkers that correlate with the severity of COVID-19, the need for hospitalization, and mortality, reflecting the host immune response's contribution to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

{"text": "Viral nucleoprotein antibodies activate TRIM21 and induce T cell immunity. Nucleoprotein (N) is an immunodominant antigen in many enveloped virus infections. While the diagnostic value of anti-N antibodies is clear, their role in immunity is not. This is because while they are non-neutralising, they somehow clear infection by coronavirus, influenza and LCMV in vivo. Here, we show that anti-N immune protection is mediated by the cytosolic Fc receptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. Exploiting LCMV as a model system, we demonstrate that TRIM21 uses anti-N antibodies to target N for cytosolic degradation and generate cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) against N peptide. These CTLs rapidly eliminate N-peptide-displaying cells and drive efficient viral clearance. These results reveal a new mechanism of immune synergy between antibodies and T cells and highlights N as an important vaccine target. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "The impact of episodic screening interruption: COVID-19 and population-based cancer screening in Canada. BACKGROUND: Population-based cancer screening can reduce cancer burden but was interrupted temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated the long-term clinical impact of breast and colorectal cancer screening interruptions in Canada using a validated mathematical model., METHODS: We used the OncoSim breast and colorectal cancers microsimulation models to explore scenarios of primary screening stops for 3, 6, and 12 months followed by 6-24-month transition periods of reduced screening volumes. For breast cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, additional advanced-stage cases diagnosed, and excess cancer deaths in 2020-2029. For colorectal cancer, we estimated changes in cancer incidence over time, undiagnosed advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in 2020, and lifetime excess cancer incidence and deaths., RESULTS: Our simulations projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, a three-month interruption could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and cancer deaths (110 more) in 2020-2029. A six-month interruption could lead to 670 extra advanced cancers and 250 additional cancer deaths. For colorectal cancers, a six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Interruptions in cancer screening will lead to additional cancer deaths, additional advanced cancers diagnosed, and a surge in demand for downstream resources when screening resumes.

BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is known to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic. Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) concentrations are elevated in patients with various cardiovascular disorders including heart failure., METHODS: In a total of 182 consecutive adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and 63 healthy controls, sACE2 concentrations were measured in serum using the Human ACE2 R assay by Cloud-Clone Corporation and associated with clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters., RESULTS: Median sACE2 levels were increased in patients with complex CHD as compared to healthy controls (761.9 pg/ml vs 365.2 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Moreover, sACE2 concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with a higher NYHA class >= III (1856.2 pg/ml vs 714.5 pg/ml in patients with NYHA class I/II, p < 0.001). Using linear regression analysis, higher sACE2 levels were associated with a higher NYHA class >= III, more severe CHD, a morphological left systemic ventricle, higher creatinine and the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in the univariable model. The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) was associated with lower sACE2 levels. In the multivariable model, higher sACE2 levels were independently associated with a higher NYHA class >= III (p = 0.002) and lower sACE2 levels with the use of ACE inhibitors or ARB (p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Soluble ACE2 concentrations were significantly increased in all types of complex CHD with highest levels found in patients with NYHA class >= III.

{"text": "Analyzing and forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using ARIMA and SIR models. The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is spreading all across the globe. By June 29, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the number of cases worldwide had reached 9 994 206 and resulted in more than 499 024 deaths. The earliest case of COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was registered on March 2 in 2020. Since then, the number of infections as per the outcome of the tests increased gradually on a daily basis. The KSA has 182 493 cases, with 124 755 recoveries and 1551 deaths on June 29, 2020. There have been significant efforts to develop models that forecast the risks, parameters, and impacts of this epidemic. These models can aid in controlling and preventing the outbreak of these infections. In this regard, this article details the extent to which the infection cases, prevalence, and recovery rate of this pandemic are in the country and the predictions that can be made using the past and current data. The well-known classical SIR model was applied to predict the highest number of cases that may be realized and the flattening of the curve afterward. On the other hand, the ARIMA model was used to predict the prevalence cases. Results of the SIR model indicate that the repatriation plan reduced the estimated reproduction number. The results further affirm that the containment technique used by Saudi Arabia to curb the spread of the disease was efficient. Moreover, using the results, close interaction between people, despite the current measures remains a great risk factor to the spread of the disease. This may force the government to take even more stringent measures. By validating the performance of the applied models, ARIMA proved to be a good forecasting method from current data. The past data and the forecasted data, as per the ARIMA model provided high correlation, showing that there were minimum errors.

{"text": "Sequential Data Assimilation of the Stochastic SEIR Epidemic Model for Regional COVID-19 Dynamics. Newly emerging pandemics like COVID-19 call for predictive models to implement precisely tuned responses to limit their deep impact on society. Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peaking before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed individuals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with relatively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The aim of this multicentre study is to gain a greater understanding of the impact lockdown has had on the rates, mechanisms and types of injuries together with their management across a regional trauma service., Methods: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019., Results: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019.

Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period in central Germany on overall and cardiovascular deaths. Simultaneously we looked at catheterization activities in the same region., METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 22 of 24 public health-authorities in central Germany were aggregated during the pandemic related lockdown period and compared to the same time period in 2019. Information on the total number of deaths and causes of death, including cardiovascular mortality, were collected. Additionally, we compared rates of hospitalization (n = 5178) for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 26 hospitals in this area. Data on 5,984 deaths occurring between March 23, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated. In comparison to the reference non-pandemic period in 2019 (deaths: n = 5832), there was a non-significant increase in all-cause mortality of 2.6% [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.06; p = 0.16].

CONTEXT: The ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected abortion providers and abortion care, and the strategies clinics are adopting to navigate the pandemic, have not been well documented., METHODS: In April-May 2020, representatives from 103 independent abortion clinics (i.e., those not affiliated with Planned Parenthood) completed a survey that included close-ended questions about how the pandemic, the public health response, and designations of abortion as a nonessential service had affected their clinic, as well as open-ended questions about the pandemic's impact. Analyses were primarily descriptive but included an exploration of regional variation., RESULTS: All U.S. regions were represented in the sample. At 51% of clinics, clinicians or staff had been unable to work because of the pandemic or public health responses. Temporary closures were more common among clinics in the South (35%) and Midwest (21%) than in the Northeast and West (5% each). More than half of clinics had canceled or postponed nonabortion services (e.g., general gynecologic care); cancelation or postponement of abortion services was less common (25-38%, depending on type) and again especially prevalent in the South and Midwest. Providers reported the pandemic had had numerous effects on their clinics, including disrupting their workforce, clinic flow and work practices; increasing expenses; and reducing revenues. State laws (including designations of abortion as nonessential) had exacerbated these difficulties., CONCLUSIONS: Although independent abortion clinics have faced considerable challenges from the pandemic, most continued to provide abortion care. Despite this resiliency, additional support may be needed to ensure sustainability of these clinics. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

While the disease is not rare, but the symptoms may be atypical in children. Case Presentation: A 12-month-old boy with fever and rash without respiratory com-plaints at the onset of the disease presented to the hospital. His illness was then accompanied by severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoxemia, and pleural effusion. The nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test was positive for the novel coronavirus. Despite primary normal lung imaging, the second imaging was typical for the disease on the third day of admission. Discussion(s): Dermatologic manifestations of the novel coronavirus infection are not rare during the illness but rarely occur at the onset of the disease. Information about the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its time interval from the onset of the disease in children are not clear yet. Severe anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and pleural effusion are not reported as classic findings of the novel SARS-CoV-2. They may be considered as a consequence of the hyperinflammatory response or direct effect of the virus. Conclusion(s): As a different manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, infected children may initially present fever and rash. More studies are needed to discover the cause of these complications. The correct answer may lead to better insight and more effective treatment.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Navaeifar et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVES: Examine possible pooling strategies designed to expand SARS-CoV-2 serological testing capacity., METHODS: Negative pools were assessed to determine optimal optical density (OD) cutoffs, followed by spiking weak or strong positive samples to assess initial assay performance. Samples were then randomly subjected to pool and individual testing approaches., RESULTS: Single positive specimens consistently converted pools of 5, 10, or 20 into positive outcomes. However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes. Finally, examination of 150 samples configured into pools of 5, 10, 20 or 50 accurately predicted the presence of positive or negative specimens within each pool., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pooling strategies may allow expansion of serological testing capacity.

Respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated with high mortality in SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These manifestations are linked to a hypercoaguable, pro-inflammatory state with persistent, systemic complement activation. Three critical COVID-19 patients recalcitrant to multiple interventions had skin biopsies documenting deposition of the terminal complement component C5b-9, the lectin complement pathway enzyme MASP2, and C4d in microvascular endothelium. Administration of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab led to a marked decline in D-dimers and neutrophil counts in all three cases, and normalization of liver functions and creatinine in two. One patient with severe heart failure and AKI had a complete remission. The other two individuals had partial remissions, one with resolution of his AKI but ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure, and another with a significant decline in FiO2 requirements, but persistent renal failure.

Objective: Determine whether various stresses change the expression in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated lineages, of a large set of viral receptors and susceptibility genes. Design(s): Experimental. Material(s) and Method(s): ESC were tested by bulk or single cell (sc) RNAseq after 72 hr exposures to 0-300 mM hyperosmotic sorbitol (with stemness-maintaining Leukemia Inhibitory Factor, LIF) to quantify stress-forced differentiation. Controls for normal stemness were LIF+ and normal differentiation were LIF-. RNA was isolated by RNAeasy lysis or 10XGenomics Dropseq, RNA quality was checked by Agilent TapeStation, cDNA was synthesized using Lexogen's QuantSeq library kit, and barcoded, multiplexed and sequenced by Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Data were demultiplexed by CASAVA software and FC expression was compared between conditions. In triplicate experiments, significant fold change (FC) genes (FC>=2; FDR<=0.05, P<0.05) identified affected pathways. Proliferation or death were assayed by Hoechst staining or Trypan blue staining, respectively. Validating studies including qPCR. Result(s): Using bulk RNAseq it was shown that VIM and TMPRSS2, two genes necessary for Covid-19 cell uptake are up-regulated significantly as measured by P-value and FDR. VIM is up-regulated 5.6 fold higher at 300 mM sorbitol compared with normal differentiation and TMPRSS2 is also up-regulated 3.1 fold higher by high sorbitol despite LIF presence. Havcr1 the hepatitis A virus receptor was up-regulated 55 fold over normal ESC differentiation with significance by p-Value and FDR. Pvrl1 the Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor was up-regulated 4.5 fold compared with ESC undergoing normal differentiation by LIF removal. Conclusion(s): These are proof-of-principle studies that suggest that some viruses have high susceptibility when ESC and their progeny differentiated lineages undergo hyperosmotic stress. HSV1 is known to cross the placenta, and recent data suggest that Covid-19 may cross the placenta and induce IgM detected in cord blood. We intend to extend these tests using Phthalates and cortisol and to test human embryonic stem cells for similar stress-enhanced susceptibility.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM IN PATIENTS WITH SARS-COV-2 VIRUS (COVID-19). SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Disorders of the Mediastinum Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: In March, 2020 the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") declared SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has been noted to present a variety of symptoms including anosmia (loss of sense of smell), dyspnea, cough, fever, diarrhea and acute respiratory failure. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a rare complication with viral pneumonia. We here present one of the two cases with this finding. CASE PRESENTATION: 63-years-old male presented with fever, chills, and progressive shortness of breath over the past week. Patient was previously diagnosed with corona virus disease with reverse transcriptase RNA PCR test. Past medical history was significant for diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On presentation, patient was hypoxic (SaO2 84%). Physical examination revealed reduced breath sounds bilaterally and soft-tissue crepitus in bilateral clavicle area. Laboratory test results showed elevated C-reactive protein concentration, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) showed diffuse lower neck/chest wall subcutaneous emphysema with associated diffuse pneumomediastinum and bilateral ground-glass airspace infiltrates (Figure 1,2,3). Patient was started on anti-infective therapy with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin, and placed on nasal cannula at 4 liter/minute. On day four of admission, patient developed multi-organ failure requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Later on day twelve, patient expired due to cardiopulmonary arrest. DISCUSSION: Pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of free air in the mediastinum with an incidence of 1 in every 25,000 cases in ages between 5-34 years, predominantly found in males. It may be spontaneous from a predisposing factor or due to secondary causes. SARS-CoV-2 is a new addition to secondary pulmonary causes, being reported recently in literature. The pathophysiology of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is explained due to pressure gradient difference between alveoli and lung interstitial tissue. SARS-CoV-2 infects type I and II pneumocytes, disrupting alveolar membrane integrity leading to alveolar rupture and leakage of air into interstitial tissue, as well as severe hypoxemia increasing respiratory effort. Associated clinical symptoms of pneumomediastinum are varying, including dyspnea, although a portion of patient are asymptomatic. Pneumomediastinum is typically identified through chest x-ray with management being primary conservative. CONCLUSION(S): Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in association with SARS-CoV-2 is a serious condition and merits early recognition. Despite early diagnosis and optimal management, the mortality was 100% in our two patients of Covid-19 associated mediastinum. Reference #1: Wang J, Su X, Zhang T, Zheng C.

{"text": "The psychological impact on an orthopaedic outpatient setting in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the coronavirus claimed 4628 lives worldwide. Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. RESULT(S): A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. \"Work adjustments\" (74.2%), \"changes in personal plans\" (72.6%), and finding it \"confining\" (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, \"financial concerns\" garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). CONCLUSION(S): The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Targeting SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain by Therapeutic Antibodies. As the number of people infected with the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is continuously increasing every day, development of potential therapeutic platforms is vital. Based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, it seems crucial to assay the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with SARS-CoV2 spike (S)-protein. Indeed, developing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope-specific vaccines (ESV). Herein, we present an overview on the discovery of new CoV followed by some explanation on the SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD site. Furthermore, we surveyed the novel therapeutic mAbs for targeting S-protein RBD such as S230, 80R, F26G18, F26G19, CR3014, CR3022, M396, and S230.15. Afterwards, the mechanism of interaction of RBD and different mAbs were explained and it was suggested that one of the SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs, namely CR3022, could show the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for rapid and sensitive advancement of therapeutic mAbs targeting S-protein RBD were discussed. In conclusion, it may be proposed that this review may pave the way for recognition of RBD and different mAbs to develop potential therapeutic ESV.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objective: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably burdened the healthcare system in the Hubei Province, the most severely affected region in China. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare workers in Hubei. Method(s): A total of 2737 healthcare workers were sampled using a two-dimensional code shared online between Mar 4 and Mar 9, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of three elements: baseline characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome variables were PQSI, anxiety and depression scores of non-medical staff, non-frontline medical staff and frontline medical staff. Binary logistical regression analyses were used to compare between respondents with and without sleep disturbance. Result(s): About 61.6% of the respondents reported sleep problems, 22.6% experienced anxiety, and 35% exhibited depressive symptoms. The prevalence of sleep disorders was higher among the frontline healthcare workers compared to the non-frontline and non-medical staff, while anxiety and depression were prevalent in the entire cohort. Logistic regression analysis identified medical occupation, family burden, bereavement, anxiety, and depression as significantly predictive of poor sleep quality. Conclusion(s): Frontline medical staff are more vulnerable to sleep disturbances. Psychosocial interventions are needed to help allied healthcare personnel to better respond to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wang, Song, Xia, He, Tang, Hou and Lei.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Physical exam showed no neurologic deficit. Two weeks later, respiratory symptoms were improving but she developed sudden leg pain, numbness, and weakness. She described it as a \"pain crisis\". Neurological exam showed bilateral symmetrical, non-ascending lower extremity weakness and normal, symmetric reflexes. She had normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, spinal fluid analysis, serum studies including creatinine kinase and C-reactive protein. She had elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low serum copper (72.9 (ref: 80.0-155.0 ug/dL)) and low vitamin B6 (14.6 (ref: 20.0-125.0 nmol/L)). A diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2-associated peripheral neuropathy was considered. We pursued empiric treatment with intravenous steroids (1000 mg methylprednisolone for three days), followed by a total of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) given over five days. Pain management was done with gabapentin and ketorolac. We replaced copper and vitamin B6.

Previous reports of treatment of SARS-Cov-2-associated neuropathy included corticosteroids and IVIG. Our patient saw the most symptomatic improvement with gabapentin. In our case, the preserved reflexes, lack of ascending pattern, sudden onset of symptoms, and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) argued against Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to examine the overall distribution of chronic comorbidities in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infected populations and the risk of the underlying burden of disease in terms of the case fatality ratio (CFR). Method(s): We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on COVID-19 patients published before 10th April 2020. Twenty-three studies containing data for 202,005 COVID-19 patients were identified and included in our study. Pooled effects of chronic comorbid conditions and CFR with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models. Result(s): A median age of COVID-19 patients was 56.4 years and 55% of the patients were male. The most prevalent chronic comorbid conditions were: any type of chronic comorbidity (37%; 95% CI 32-41%), hypertension (22%; 95% CI 17-27%), diabetes (14%; 95% CI 12-17%), respiratory diseases (5%; 95% CI 3-6%), cardiovascular diseases (13%; 95% CI 10-16%) and other chronic diseases (e.g., cancer) (8%; 95% CI 6-10%). Furthermore, 37% of COVID-19 patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition, 28% of patients had two conditions, and 19% of patients had three or more chronic conditions. The overall pooled CFR was 7% (95% CI 6-7%). The crude CFRs increased significantly with increasing number of chronic comorbid conditions, ranging from 6% for at least one chronic comorbid condition to 13% for 2 or 3 chronic comorbid conditions, 12% for 4 chronic comorbid conditions, 14% for 5 chronic comorbid conditions, and 21% for 6 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Furthermore, the overall CFRs also significantly increased with higher levels of reported clinical symptoms, ranging from 14% for at least four symptoms, to 15% for 5 or 6 symptoms, and 21% for 7 or more symptoms. Conclusion(s): The chronic comorbid conditions were identified as dominating risk factors, which should be considered in an emergency disease management and treatment choices.

Until recently, this infection in humans was mainly observed during the autumn-winter period and characterized by a mild, often asymptomatic, course. The situation changed dramatically in 2003, when SARS outbreak caused by pathogenic CoV (SARS-CoV) was recorded in China. A decade later, a new CoV outbreak occurred in the form of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), whereas in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases were recorded, which transformed within the first months of 2020 into the pandemic. In all three cases, CoV disease led to severe bronchopulmonary lesions, varying from dry, debilitating cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). At the same time, multiple changes in innate immunity were noted most often manifested as a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the lower respiratory tract, featured by damaged type II pneumocytes, apoptosis, hyalinization of alveolar membranes, focal or generalized pulmonary edema. Destructive processes in the respiratory tract were accompanied by migration of monocytes/macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils to the inflammatory focus. Such events were accompanied by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which magnitude could ascend up to a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV is characterized by symptoms of secondary immunosuppression, manifested by the late onset of interferon production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes - the key inflammatory factor. The reason for such reaction may be accounted for by CoV arsenal containing extensive set of structural and non-structural proteins exerting pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Delayed IFN production allowed CoV to replicate actively and freely, and when type I IFN synthesis was eventually triggered, its activity was detrimental and accompanied by an aggravated infection course. Thus, SARS can surely be referred to immune-dependent infections with a marked immunopathological component. The purpose of this review was to describe some mechanisms underlying formation of innate immune response to infection caused by pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).Copyright \u00a9 2020 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

{"text": "Increased incidence of precocious and accelerated puberty in females during and after the Italian lockdown for the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The timing of puberty in girls is occurring at an increasingly early age. While a positive family history is recognised as a predisposing factor for early or precocious puberty, the role of environmental factors is not fully understood., AIMS OF THE STUDY: To make a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of newly diagnosed central precocious puberty (CPP) and the rate of pubertal progression in previously diagnosed patients during and after the Italian lockdown for COVID-19, comparing data with corresponding data from the previous 5 years. To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and the use of electronic devices increased during lockdown in these patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 49 females with CPP. We divided the patients into two groups: group 1, patients presenting a newly diagnosed CPP and group 2, patients with previously diagnosed slow progression CPP whose pubertal progression accelerated during or after lockdown. We collected auxological, clinical, endocrinological and radiological data which were compared with data from two corresponding control groups (patients followed by our Unit, March to July 2015-2019). Patients' families completed a questionnaire to assess differences in the use of electronic devices before and during lockdown., RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients presented newly diagnosed CPP (group 1) and 12, with previously diagnosed but untreated slow progression CPP presented an acceleration in the rate of pubertal progression (group 2). The number of new CPP diagnoses was significantly higher than the mean for the same period of the previous 5 years (p < 0.0005). There were no significant differences between patients in group 1 and control group 1 regarding time between appearance of B2 and CPP diagnosis, although group 1 patients had a significantly earlier chronological age at B2, a more advanced Tanner stage at diagnosis (p < 0.005), higher basal LH and E2 levels, higher LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05) and increased uterine length (p < 0.005) and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). The number of patients with previously diagnosed CPP whose pubertal development accelerated was also statistically higher compared to controls (p < 0.0005). In this group, patients' basal LH (p < 0.05) and E2 levels (p < 0.0005) became more markedly elevated as did the LH peak after LHRH test (p < 0.05). These patients also showed a significantly accelerated progression rate as measured by the Tanner scale (p < 0.0005), uterine length (p < 0.005), and ovarian volume (p < 0.0005). In both group 1 and group 2, BMI increased significantly (p < 0.05) and patients' families reported an increased use of electronic devices (p < 0.0005)., CONCLUSION: Our data show an increased incidence of newly diagnosed CPP and a faster rate of pubertal progression in patients with a previous diagnosis, during and after lockdown compared to previous years. We hypothesize that triggering environmental factors, such as the BMI and the use of electronic devices, were enhanced during lockdown, stressing their possible role in triggering/influencing puberty and its progression. However, more studies are needed to determine which factors were involved and how they interacted.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the outcomes of children with MIS-C., METHOD: Multicenter, prospective cohort study, conducted in 17 pediatric intensive care units in five states in Brazil, from March to July 2020. Patients from 1 month to 19 years who met the MIS-C diagnostic criteria were included consecutively., RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included, with the following conditions: Kawasaki-like disease (n=26), incomplete Kawasaki disease (n=16), acute cardiac dysfunction (n=10), toxic shock syndrome (n=3), and macrophage activation syndrome (n=1). Median age was 6.2 years (IQR 2.4-10.3), 70% were boys, 59% were non-whites, 20% had comorbidities, 48% reported a contact with COVID-19 cases, and 55% had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 71%, shock symptoms in 59%, and severe respiratory symptoms in less than 20%. d-Dimer was increased in 80% and cardiac dysfunction markers in more than 75%. Treatment included immunoglobulin (89%); corticosteroids, antibiotics, and enoxaparin in about 50%; and oseltamivir and antifungal therapy in less than 10%. Only 11% needed invasive mechanical ventilation, with a median duration of five days (IQR 5-6.5). The median length of PICU stay was six days (IQR 5-11), and one death occurred (1.8%)., CONCLUSIONS: Most characteristics of the present MIS-C patients were similar to that of other cohorts. The present results may contribute to a broader understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and its short-term consequences. Long-term multidisciplinary follow-up is needed, since it is not known whether these patients will have chronic cardiac impairment or other sequelae.

{"text": "Maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis. Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and may adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. We estimated the adverse maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women and determined heterogeneity in the estimates and associated factors. Study Designs: PubMed search was performed of confirmed COVID-19 pregnant cases and related outcomes were ascertained prior to July 8, 2020, in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies reporting premature birth, low birth weight, COVID-19 infection in neonates, or mode of delivery status were included in the study. Two investigators independently performed searches, assessed quality of eligible studies as per the Cochrane handbook recommendations, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled proportions of maternal and neonatal outcomes were estimated using meta-analyses for studies with varying sample sizes while a systematic review with descriptive data analysis was performed for case report studies. Maternal and neonatal outcomes included C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, adverse pregnancy events and COVID transmission in neonates. Result(s): A total of 790 COVID-19 positive females and 548 neonates from 61 studies were analyzed. The rates of C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy events were estimated as 72 %, 23 %, 7 %, and 27 % respectively. In the heterogeneity analysis, the rate of C-section was substantially higher in Chinese studies (91 %) compared to the US (40 %) or European (38 %) studies. The rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy events were also lowest in the US studies (12 %, 15 %) compared to Chinese (17 %, 21 %), and European studies (19 %, 19 %). In case reports, the rates of C-section, preterm birth, and low birth weight were estimated as 69 %, 56 %, and 35 %, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were associated with infection acquired at early gestational ages, more symptomatic presentation, myalgia symptom at presentation, and use of oxygen support therapy. Conclusion(s): Adverse pregnancy outcomes were prevalent in COVID-19 infected females and varied by location, type, and size of the studies. Regular screening and early detection of COVID-19 in pregnant women may provide more favorable outcomes.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Lymphopenia, peak platelet/ lymphocyte ratio and neu-trophil/lymphocyte ratio are some of the parameters that could be considered as prognostic markers of the disease. Disseminated intravascular coag-ulation, along with elevated D-dimer levels, are commonly encountered and are usually associated with a worsening clinical picture.

Context: COVID 19 vertical transmission is a great concern in different aspects of mother, child, healthcare staff and community safety and protection. There is lack of definitive evidence confirming or declining mother to child COVID 19 transmission. This article is an update on this challenging issue. Evidence Acquisition: This article is a comprehensive search in scientific major database from 1 January 2020 up to 25 April 2020 with the key words of \"COVID 19\" and \"vertical transmission\" or \"neonatal\". Two researchers reviewed all selected articles to extract data about neonatal COVID 19 and vertical transmission. Those reports that provided the results of PCR on fetus or neonate blood, amniotic fluid or pharyngeal secretion samples or elevated COVID 19 specific IgM were included. Those reports based on clinical COVID 19 characteristics or radiological findings were not included in data extraction. Thirty six articles have been reviewed and evidence supporting or against COVID 19 Vertical transmission have been extracted and discussed. Result(s): Most previous studies on vertical COVID 19 transmission have been tested placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and newborn blood or pharyngeal swab sample using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that may show false negative results due to suboptimal sampling or inefficient viral load. Increased COVID 19 specific IgG/IgM antibodies have been reported in newborns from COVID 19 mothers; however, data is limited and longitudinal follow up is needed. Evidence supporting COVID 19 vertical transmission: Recent reports indicated that pharyngeal PCR test turned positive in first few hours of life in several neonates. Also increased level of COVID 19 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in newborns to COVID 19 positive mothers were observed. Rate of perinatal complications were higher among newborns of COVID 19 mothers. Evidence against COVID 19 vertical transmis-sion: All tissue or blood specimens and pharyngeal swab qRT-PCR tests among neonates born from COVID 19 mothers were negative. Rate of cross reactivity and false positive results are high in serologic studies. Conclusion(s): COVID 19 vertical transmission is a growing health care concern that needs further investigation; however, it is sug-gested to be equipped with PPE on contacts with both COVID 19 pregnant woman and her newborn baby and apply early separation, isolation, testing and close follow up for both mother and child.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID-19: The influence of ACE genotype and ACE-I and ARBs on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients. Since the beginning of 2020, the whole world has been struggling with the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147, which are expressed on host cells. Several studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2 might be a risk factor of COVID-19 infection. Genotypes affect ACE2 structure, its serum concentration, and levels of circulating angiotensin (1-7). Moreover, there is evidence that ACE genotype affects the outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment, the most severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 morbidity, infection course, and mortality might depend on ACE D allele frequency. The aim of this narrative review was to analyze and identify the mechanisms of ACE-I and ARBs with particular emphasis on angiotensin receptors and their polymorphism in the light of COVID-19 pandemic as these medications are commonly prescribed to elderly patients. There is no direct evidence yet for ACE-I or ARBs in the treatment of COVID-19. However, for those already taking these medications, both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing the treatment, because at present, there is no clear clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of ACE-I or ARBs. Individualized treatment decisions should be based on the clinical condition and co-morbidities of each patient.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Sienko et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The current study aimed to explore mental health problems in patients diagnosed with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cluster sampling, cross-sectional survey with 6213 cancer patients was conducted in one of the largest cancer centers in China. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, psychosomatic conditions, interpersonal relationships and social support, COVID-19 infection-related psychological stress, and mental health status were measured. Medical conditions were extracted from patients' electronic healthcare records. Among the 6213 cancer patients, 23.4% had depression, 17.7% had anxiety, 9.3% had PTSD, and 13.5% had hostility. Hierarchical liner regression models showed that having a history of mental disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, having a higher frequency of worrying about cancer management due to COVID-19, having a higher frequency feeling of overwhelming psychological pressure from COVID-19, and having a higher level of fatigue and pain were the predominant risk factors for mental health problems in cancer patients. However, there were only 1.6% of them were seeking psychological counseling during COVID-19. We also revealed the protective factors associated with lower risk of mental health problems among cancer patients. The present study revealed a high prevalence of mental health problems and gaps in mental health services for cancer patients, which also indicated high distress from COVID-19-elevated risks.

{"text": "Impact analysis of COVID-19 responses on energy grid dynamics in Europe. When COVID-19 pandemic spread in Europe, governments imposed unprecedented confinement measures with mostly unknown repercussions on contemporary societies. In some cases, a considerable drop in energy consumption was observed, anticipating a scenario of sizable low-cost energy generation, from renewable sources, expected only for years later. In this paper, the impact of governmental restrictions on electrical load, generation and transmission was investigated in 16 European countries. Using the indices provided by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, precise restriction types were found to correlate with the load drop. Then the European grid was analysed to assess how the load drop was balanced by the change in generation and transmission patterns. The same restriction period from 2020 was compared to previous years, accounting for yearly variability with ad hoc statistical technique. As a result, generation was found to be heavily impacted in most countries with significant load drop. Overall, generation from nuclear, and fossil coal and gas sources was reduced, in favour of renewables and, in some countries, fossil gas. Moreover, intermittent renewables generation increased in most countries without indicating an exceptional amount of curtailments. Finally, the European grid helped balance those changes with an increase in both energy exports and imports, with some net exporting countries becoming net importers, notably Germany, and vice versa. Together, these findings show the far reaching implications of the COVID-19 crisis, and contribute to the understanding and planning of higher renewables share scenarios, which will become more prevalent in the battle against climate change.

Background: Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain largely unknown. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. Clinical data were collected from medical records from 13 January 2020 to 26 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result(s): A total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0-70.0) years. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%). Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%). The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%). A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%.

{"text": "Postoperative Onset and Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Surgically Resected Specimens From Gastrointestinal Cancer Patients With Pre/Asymptomatic COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiologic features and clinical courses of gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 and to explore evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the surgically resected specimens. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The advisory of postponing or canceling elective surgeries escalated a worldwide debate regarding the safety and feasibility of performing elective surgical procedures during this pandemic. Limited data are available on gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 undergoing surgery. METHOD(S): Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Surgically resected specimens of the cases with confirmed COVID-19 were obtained to detect the expression of ACE2 and the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULT(S): A total of 52 patients (male, 34) with a median age 62.5 years were enrolled. All the patients presented no respiratory symptoms or abnormalities on chest computed tomography before surgery. Six patients (11.5%) experienced symptom onset and were confirmed to be COVID-19. All were identified to be preoperatively pre/asymptomatic, as 5 were with SARS-CoV-2 presenting in cytoplasm of enterocytes or macrophages from the colorectal tissues and 1 had symptom onset immediately after surgery. The case fatality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 16.7%, much higher than those without COVID-19 (2.2%). CONCLUSION(S): Gastrointestinal cancer patients with pre/asymptomatic COVID-19 were at high risk of postoperative onset and death. At current pandemic, elective surgery should be postponed or canceled. It highlights the need for investigating the full clinical spectrum and natural history of this infection. The early colorectal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may have major implications on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Introduction: Hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndromes are a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by deficiencies in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). Patients with HIGM are predisposed to infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant complications. We describe a case of a 21-year-old male with HIGM presenting with fever and severe oral ulcers. Case Description: A 21-year-old male with HIGM due to a CD40L mutation on immunoglobulin therapy was admitted for 4-week history of painful erosive oral lesions, sore throat, and fever. He had deep ulcers on his hard palate, tonsils, and tongue that worsened despite treatment with valacyclovir and azithromycin as an outpatient. Neutrophil counts were normal. Blood and respiratory cultures were negative; one out of two throat fungal cultures showed Candida albicans. Biopsy of the ulcers was negative for fungal elements and HSV. COVID-19 PCR was negative, but COVID-19 IgM to the receptor-binding domain was positive (1:80). IgG was negative, which was expected with HIGM. The patient was treated with acyclovir, fluconazole, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole while undergoing infectious work-up. He continued to have fevers with no improvement in stomatitis. After adding prednisone, his ulcers and fever quickly resolved. Discussion(s): This remains an unclear case of chronic fevers and severe oral ulcers in a patient with HIGM. Candida albicans was unlikely to be the cause. Surprisingly, COVID-19 IgM was positive, suggesting that an infection had occurred. Mucosal involvement has been increasingly reported with COVID-19, and lesions may be more severe in patients with primary immunodeficiency. Steroids may be an effective therapy once other infections are excluded. [Formula presented]Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Explaining among-country variation in COVID-19 case fatality rate. While the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide, there is much concern over the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate had varied temporally (as the epidemic has progressed) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries. We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. We found that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found several factors associated with temporal changes in case fatality rate both among variables describing comorbidity risk and demographic, economic and political variables. In particular, countries with the highest values of DALYs lost to cardiovascular, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases had the highest values of COVID-19 CFR. CFR was also positively associated with the death rate due to smoking in people over 70 years. Interestingly, CFR was negatively associated with share of death due to lower respiratory infections. Among the demographic, economic and political variables, CFR was positively associated with share of the population over 70, GDP per capita, and level of democracy, while it was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1000. Overall, these results emphasize the role of comorbidity and socio-economic factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the population level.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Development of a hyperimmune equine serum therapy for covid-19 in Argentina. The disease named COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is currently generating a global pandemic. Vaccine development is no doubt the best long-term immunological approach, but in the current epidemiologic and health emergency there is a need for rapid and effective solutions. Convalescent plasma is the only antibody-based therapy available for COVID-19 patients to date. Equine polyclonal antibodies (EpAbs) put forward a sound alternative. The new generation of processed and purified EpAbs containing highly purified F(ab')2 fragments demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. EpAbs are easy to manufacture allowing a fast development and scaling up for a treatment. Based on these ideas, we present a new therapeutic product obtained after immunization of horses with the receptor-binding domain of the viral Spike glycoprotein. Our product shows around 50 times more potency in in vitro seroneutralization assays than the average of convalescent plasma. This result may allow us to test the safety and efficacy of this product in a phase 2/3 clinical trial to be conducted in July 2020 in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas.

Objectives: In order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on oral health and possible saliva transmission, we performed RNA-seq profiles analysis from public databases and also a questionnaire survey on oral-related symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): To analyse ACE2 expression in salivary glands, bulk RNA-seq profiles from four public datasets including 31 COVID-19 patients were recruited. Saliva and oropharyngeal swabs were collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in saliva were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, a questionnaire survey on various oral symptoms such as dry mouth and amblygeustia was also carried out on COVID-19 patients. Result(s): ACE2 expression was present at detectable levels in the salivary glands. In addition, of four cases with positive detection of salivary SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, three (75%) were critically ill on ventilator support. Furthermore, we observed the two major oral-related symptoms, dry mouth (46.3%) and amblygeustia (47.2%), were manifested by a relatively high proportion of 108 COVID-19 patients who accepted the questionnaire survey. Conclusion(s): This study confirms the expression of ACE2 in the salivary glands and demonstrates the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection of salivary glands. Saliva may be a new source of diagnostic specimens for critically ill patients, since it can be easily collected without any invasive procedures. In addition, dry mouth and amblygeustia can be considered as initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "Defining facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Twitter analysis. Objectives: Using Twitter, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine amplified tweets among social distancing facets. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed English and US-based tweets containing \"coronavirus\" between January 23-March 24, 2020 using the Twitter API. Tweets containing keywords were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Result(s): A total of 259,529 unique tweets were included in the analyses. Social distancing tweets became more prevalent from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. Early facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle: the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the \"implementation\" and \"negative emotions\" facets largely dominated in combination with topics of \"social disruption\" and \"adaptation\", albeit to lesser degree. Social disruptiveness tweets were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. Discussion(s): Social distancing can be defined by facets that respond to and represent certain events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising case counts. For example, Miami had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March corresponding with the rise of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion(s): The evolution of social distancing facets on Twitter reflects actual events and may signal potential disease hotspots. Our facets can also be used to understand public discourse on social distancing which may inform future public health measures.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become pandemic worldwide. A better understanding of asymptomatic infections is crucial to prevent and control this epidemic. Here, we report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of a family cluster with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the family cluster, a 32-year-old male (case 1) and a 53-year-old female (case 2, the mother-in-law of case 1) exhibited clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while case 1's 32-year-old wife (case 3) and their 11-month-old daughter (case 4) were both asymptomatic. Notably, case 4's nasopharyngeal swab samples was negative for nearly 80 days, and her immune system has been boosted for at least 57 days, but the fecal samples have tested positive for 100 days (May 13, 2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may invade enterocytes and may exist in individuals with low antiviral immunity for a long term. This report highlights that asymptomatic infections should be managed with caution and vigilance. For SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic cases, besides the normally used nasopharyngeal swab, fecal sample testing is also needed.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Chen, Si, Tang, Zhang, Pan, An, Zhang, Xue, Wu, Chen, Zhang, Liu and Fu.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of viral load and host immune response throughout the disease course depending on disease severity. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed viral load, antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, and cytokines/chemokines during the disease course, and identified the factors related to severity. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and plasma specimens were obtained from 31 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Viral RNA in NP specimens was quantified by reverse transcription-PCR. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokines/chemokines in plasma specimens were analyzed by ELISA and cytometric bead array. The viral load in patients with COVID-19 peaked at the early stage of the disease and continuously decreased. Severe and critical cases showed higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding than asymptomatic and mild cases. Whereas plasma IgG was gradually increased and maintained during hospitalization, plasma IgM peaked at 3 weeks after symptom onset and dissipated. The antibody response in severe and critical cases was slightly delayed but stronger than those in others. High levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma-induced protein-10, monokine induced by IFN-gamma, and interleukin-6 at 5-10 days from symptom onset were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our data indicate that high viral load in the respiratory tract and excessive production of cytokines and chemokines between 1 and 2 weeks from the symptom onset were significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-driven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented human death and has seriously threatened the global economy. Early data suggest a surge in proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe COVID-19, which has been associated with poor outcomes. We recently postulated that the inflammatory response in patients with severe COVID-19 disease is not inhibited by natural killer (NK) cells, resulting in a \"cytokine storm.\" Here, we assessed the NK-cell functional activity and the associated cytokines and soluble mediators in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Significantly impaired NK-cell counts and cytolytic activity were observed in COVID-19 patients when compared with healthy controls. Also, cytokines like interleukin 12 (IL12), IL15, and IL21 that are important for NK-cell activity were not detected systematically. Serum concentrations of soluble CD25 (sCD25)/soluble IL2 receptor alpha (sIL2-Ralpha) were significantly elevated and were inversely correlated with the percentage of NK cells. Impaired NK-cell cytolytic activity together with other laboratory trends including elevated sCD25 were consistent with a hyperinflammatory state in keeping with macrophage-activation syndrome. Our findings suggest that impaired counts and cytolytic activity of NK cells are important characteristics of severe COVID-19 and can potentially facilitate strategies for immunomodulatory therapies.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged from China in December 2019 and progressed to become a global pandemic. Our understanding of its pathophysiology and potential management was initially extrapolated from previous epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic in more than 80% of patients and requires no additional management; however, the remaining patients progress to pneumonia and hypoxemia with ranging severity, including a smaller group that requires intensive care unit admission. To date, there are no approved treatments for SARS-CoV-2, and current management is focused on supplemental oxygen and supportive care. The antiviral medication remdesivir recently received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe disease. Multiple clinical trials evaluating different treatment modalities such as antivirals, immunomodulators, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies, among others, are still ongoing.

As a novel concept of responding to disease epidemics, Fangcang shelter hospitals were deployed to expand the health system's capacity and provide medical services for non-severe COVID-19 patients during the outbreak in Wuhan. To give insights on patient management within Fangcang hospitals, we conducted a retrospective analysis to: 1) describe the characteristics of the patients admitted to Fangcang hospitals and 2) explore risk factors for longer length of stay (LOS). We enrolled 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms, who were hospitalized in the Wuti Fangcang Hospital. 58 patients completed the treatment and discharged before 1 March 2020. After describing patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure history, treatment received and time course of the disease, we conducted linear regression analysis to identify factors influencing LOS. We found that patients having fever before admission were hospitalized 3.5 days (95%CI 1.39 to 5.63, p = 0.002) longer than those without fever and that patients having bilateral pneumonia were hospitalized 3.4 days (95%CI 0.49 to 6.25, p = 0.023) longer than those with normal CT scan results. We also found weak evidence suggesting that patients with diabetes were hospitalized 3.2 days longer than those without diabetes (95%CI -0.2 to 6.56, p = 0.065). However, we observed no significant differences in LOS between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and between patients who received treatment and those without treatment. Longer duration of hospitalization among non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with having fever, bilateral pneumonia on CT scan and diabetes. However, being asymptomatic and using supportive medications at the early stage of infection do not have significant influences on LOS. Our study is a single-centered study with relatively small sample size. The findings provide evidence for predicting hospital bed demand in a novel response scenario and may help decision-makers in preparing for ramping up the health system capacity.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

PURPOSE: The optimal approach to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection among college students returning to campus is unknown. Recommendations vary from no testing to two tests per student. This research determined the strategy that optimizes the number of true positives and negatives detected and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests needed., METHODS: A decision tree analysis evaluated five strategies: (1) classifying students with symptoms as having COVID-19, (2) RT-PCR testing for symptomatic students, (3) RT-PCR testing for all students, (4) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting symptomatic students with a negative first test, and (5) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting all students with a negative first test. The number of true positives, true negatives, RT-PCR tests, and RT-PCR tests per true positive (TTP) was calculated., RESULTS: Strategy 5 detected the most true positives but also required the most tests. The percentage of correctly identified infections was 40.6%, 29.0%, 53.7%, 72.5%, and 86.9% for Strategies 1-5, respectively. All RT-PCR strategies detected more true negatives than the symptom-only strategy. Analysis of TTP demonstrated that the repeat RT-PCR strategies weakly dominated the single RT-PCR strategy and that the thresholds for more intensive RT-PCR testing decreased as the prevalence of infection increased., CONCLUSION: Based on TTP, the single RT-PCR strategy is never preferred. If the cost of RT-PCR testing is of concern, a staged approach involving initial testing of all returning students followed by a repeat testing decision based on the measured prevalence of infection might be considered.

{"text": "Human Hematopoietic Stem, Progenitor, and Immune Cells Respond Ex Vivo to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein. Despite evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is systemic in nature, there is little known about the effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure has on many host cell types, including primitive and mature hematopoietic cells. The hematopoietic system is responsible for giving rise to the very immune cells that defend against viral infection and is a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) which are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to treat hematologic disorders, thus there is a strong need to understand how exposure to the virus may affect hematopoietic cell functions. We examined the expression of ACE2, to which SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to facilitate viral entry, in cord blood derived HSCs/HPCs and in peripheral blood derived immune cell subtypes. ACE2 is expressed in low numbers of immune cells, higher numbers of HPCs, and up to 65% of rigorously defined HSCs. We also examined effects of exposing HSCs/HPCs and immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 S protein ex vivo. HSCs and HPCs expand less effectively and have less functional colony forming capacity when grown with S protein, while peripheral blood monocytes upregulate CD14 expression and show distinct changes in size and granularity. That these effects are induced by recombinant S protein alone and not the infectious viral particle suggests that simple exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may impact HSCs/HPCs and immune cells via S protein interactions with the cells, regardless of whether they can be infected. These data have implications for immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and for HCT. Graphical Abstract * Human HSCs, HPCs, and immune cells express ACE2 on the cell surface, making them potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. * SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which binds to ACE2, induces defects in the colony forming capacity of human HPC and inhibits the expansion of HSC/HPC subpopulations ex vivo. These effects can be at least partially neutralized by treatment with SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibody, recombinant human ACE2, or Angiotensin1-7. * S protein also induces aberrant morphological changes in peripheral blood derived monocytes ex vivo. * Thus, there are many different manners in which SARS-CoV-2 virus may impact the functional hematopoietic system, which has important implications for hematological manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e. thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia), immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the era of COVID-19.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Periodontitis, one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, leads to alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss, and develops due to pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontopathic bacteria are involved in respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other systemic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Patients with these diseases have an increased COVID-19 aggravation rate and mortality. Because aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene can lead to COVID-19 aggravation. Conversely, oral care, including periodontal treatment, prevents the onset of pneumonia and influenza and the exacerbation of COPD. The reduced chance of receiving professional oral care owing to long-term hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 may increase the aggravation risk of infection in the lower respiratory tract. It can be hypothesized that periodontopathic bacteria are involved in the COVID-19 aggravation and therefore, the management of good oral hygiene potentially contributes to its prevention.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The envelope glycoprotein (E) is the smallest structural component of SARS-CoVs; plays an essential role in the viral replication starting from envelope formation to assembly. The in silico analysis of 2086 whole genome sequences from India performed in this study provides the first observation on the extensive deletion of amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the envelope glycoprotein in 34 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These amino acid deletions map to the homopentameric interface and PDZ binding motif (PBM) present in the C-terminal region of E protein as well as immediately after the reverse primer binding region as per Charite protocol in 26 of these genomes, hence, their detection through RT-qPCR may not be hampered and therefore E gene-based RT-qPCR would still detect these isolates. Eight genomes from the State of Odisha had deletion even in the primer binding site. It is possible that the deletions in the C-terminal region of E protein of these genomes are a result of adapting to a newer geographical area and host.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases., METHODS: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases., RESULTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity scores and earlier follow up blood sampling. Sensitivity of the two IgG assays was comparable in hospitalized patients tested >= 14 days (EI-assay: 88%, CI95% 67.6-99.9; VT-assay: 96%, CI95% 77.7-99.8).

Hospitalized individuals with DS are on average ten years younger than patients without DS. Patients with DS have more severe disease than controls, particularly an increased incidence of sepsis and mechanical ventilation. Conclusion(s): We demonstrate that individuals with DS who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are younger than their non-DS counterparts, and that they have more severe disease than age-matched controls. We conclude that particular care should be considered for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.Copyright \u00a9 2020, American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Patients with cancer and other comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this infection., CASE: In this case report we present a 75-year-old patient with a localized gastric adenocarcinoma, currently treated by perioperative chemotherapy regimen, who had an rT-PCR proven novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed in order to assess disease severity; however, the findings were not altered in accordance with the findings associated with COVID-19 disease., RESULTS: On the first hospital day the patient had a low grade fever with chills. Subsequently a pharmacological therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was started. After pharmacologic and symptomatic treatment, the patient was reassessed for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results. At discharge, the patient was ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine. After 57 days of follow-up, the patient underwent a new rapid antibody test by Acro Biotech inc., which gave negative results for IgM and IgG., CONCLUSION: An infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a more severe disease in patients with comorbidities and cancer; however, this case patient had a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this case report is to share the information on the clinical course and outcomes of a patient with malignancy.

{"text": "Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. An essential mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be predesigned for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent patients.

With the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2, we have become acutely aware of the inadequacies of our ability to respond to viral epidemics. Although disrupting the viral life cycle is critical for limiting viral spread and disease, it has proven challenging to develop targeted and selective therapeutics. Synthetic lethality offers a promising but largely unexploited strategy against infectious viral disease; as viruses infect cells, they abnormally alter the cell state, unwittingly exposing new vulnerabilities in the infected cell. Therefore, we propose that effective therapies can be developed to selectively target the virally reconfigured host cell networks that accompany altered cellular states to cripple the host cell that has been converted into a virus factory, thus disrupting the viral life cycle.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Comparison of admission chest computed tomography and lung ultrasound performance for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in populations with different disease prevalence. Purpose: Chest computed tomography (CT) is considered a reliable imaging tool for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis, while lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a potential alternative to characterize lung involvement. The aim of the study was to compare diagnostic performance of admission chest CT and LUS for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Method(s): We included patients admitted to emergency department between February 21-March 6, 2020 (high prevalence group, HP) and between March 30-April 13, 2020 (moderate prevalence group, MP) undergoing LUS and chest CT within 12 h. Chest CT was considered positive in case of \"indeterminate\"/\"typical\" pattern for COVID-19 by RSNA classification system. At LUS, thickened pleural line with >= three B-lines at least in one zone of the 12 explored was considered positive. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC were calculated for CT and LUS against real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology as reference standard. Result(s): The study included 486 patients (males 61 %; median age, 70 years): 247 patients in HP (COVID-19 prevalence 94 %) and 239 patients in MP (COVID-19 prevalence 45 %). In HP and MP respectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90-95 %, 43-69 %, 96-72 %, 20-95 % for CT and 94-93 %, 7-31 %, 94-52 %, 7-83 % for LUS. CT demonstrated better performance than LUS in diagnosis of COVID-19, both in HP (AUC 0.75 vs 0.51; P < 0.001) and MP (AUC 0.85 vs 0.62; P < 0.001).

Background: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to patients treated with kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Moreover, the impact of the disease on hemodialysis centers, the patients, and the health care workers is still not completely understood. Objective(s): We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design(s): A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting(s): A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patient(s): A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients' characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Method(s): Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and chi2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Result(s): Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P =.4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P =.3). Advanced age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were all found to be significantly related to death. Of the 18 infected health care professionals, 13 (72%) were symptomatic and 2 (11%) were hospitalized. There was no reported death among the health care workers. Limitation(s): Limited follow-up time compared with the course of the disease along with a small sample size.

{"text": "Liver and Kidney Transplant During a 6-Month Period in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single-Center Experience. Objectives: With the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, many studies have indicated that elective surgeries should be postponed. However, post-ponement of transplants may cause diseases to get worse and increase the number in wait lists. We believe that, with precautions, transplant does not pose a risk during pandemic. Here, we aimed to evaluate our transplant results, which we safely performed during a 6-month pandemic period. Materials and Methods: Until September 2020, 3140 kidney and 667 liver transplants have been performed in our centers. We evaluated 38 kidney transplants and 9 liver transplants procedures performed during the pandemic (March 1 to September 2, 2020). Recipient and donor candidates were screened for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction and thoracic computed tomography. All recipients had routine immunosuppressive protocol. During hospitalization at our COVID-19-free transplant facility, we restricted the interactions during multidisciplinary rounds. Results: During the pandemic, 38 kidney transplants with an average length of hospital stay of 8.1 days were performed. Mean serum creatinine values of recipients were 0.91, 0.86, and 0.74 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. During the pandemic, 9 living donor liver transplants (1 adult, 8 pediatric) were performed with an average length of hospital stay of 17.1 days. Mean serum total bilirubin levels were 0.9, 0.5, and 0.4 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. Mean serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were 38.1, 28.3, and 22.3 U/L on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. All recipients and donors were successfully discharged. Only 1 liver recipient died (on day 55 after discharge as a result of oxalosis-induced heart failure). Conclusions: According to our results, when precautions are taken, transplant does not pose a risk to patients during the pandemic period.

BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and dynamic clinical changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed in the early phase of illness. This study is a case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to 11 hospitals in Korea. METHOD(S): Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory specimens by active surveillance that were finally discharged between February 20 and April 30, 2020 were included. Patients were classified into mild and non-mild groups on initial admission according to oxygen demand and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the mild group was followed up and subgrouped into non-aggravation and aggravation groups. RESULT(S): A total of 161 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection were enrolled. Among the mild group of 136 patients, 11.7% of patients experienced clinical aggravation during hospitalization, but there was no initial clinical parameter on admission predicting their aggravation. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.56), thrombocytopenia (OR, 12.87), fever (OR, 27.22) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 300 U/L (OR, 18.35), and CRP > 1 mg/dL (OR, 11.31) significantly indicated aggravation in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-day periods, respectively. PCR positivity lasted for a median of 22 days and 32 days after the onset of illness in the non-aggravation and aggravation groups, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Old age was associated with early severe presentation.

{"text": "Neutralizing Antibody Responses in COVID-19 Convalescent Sera. Passive transfer of antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients is being used as an experimental treatment for eligible patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) guidelines for convalescent plasma initially recommended target antibody titers of 160. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera from recovered COVID-19 patients using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) at moderate (PRNT50) and high (PRNT90) stringency thresholds. We found that neutralizing activity significantly increased with time post symptom onset (PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having neutralizing titers of at least 160 was ~93% (PRNT50) and ~54% (PRNT90). Sera with high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (>960 ELISA titers) showed maximal activity, but not all high titer sera contained neutralizing antibody at FDA recommended levels, particularly at high stringency. These results underscore the value of serum characterization for neutralization activity. Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS IN NON-MECHANICALLY VENTILATED SURVIVORS OF COVID-19. SESSION TITLE: Pulmonary Vascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and high mortality, however, 70-81% of all cases are classified as non-severe. COVID-19 disease is being increasingly recognized as a prothrombotic state with a high incidence of coagulopathy. Up to 30% of intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 develop a venous thromboembolism (VTE). Limited studies of non-ICU and non-mechanically ventilated patients have suggested a 5 to 10% risk of VTE. However, these studies have been limited in scope and may not be generalizable to patients seen in the United States. The goal of this study is to further characterize non-critically ill COVID-19 patients at our institution who develop VTEs. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the electronic medical record. It examined all adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on a positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab who were not mechanically ventilated during hospitalization and who were discharged alive from three hospitals comprising an integrated health system in Bronx, NY between March 11, 2020 and May 2, 2020. Patients were eligible for study inclusion if an upper or lower extremity duplex or Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging with contrast to rule out PE was performed during admission or within 14 days of discharge. Summary statistics were used to characterize patients with and without VTE based on imaging findings. Unpaired two-tailed t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test or test of proportion were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 2671 adult inpatients with COVID-19 who were not mechanically ventilated and survived to discharge, 313 (11.7%) completed CT or duplex imaging to identify VTE, and 72 patients (72/2671, 2.7%) were found to have a confirmed VTE. Out of the 72 VTE identified, 31 were located in peripheral veins, 38 were in pulmonary veins, and 3 were in both peripheral and pulmonary veins. Compared to patients without VTE on imaging, patients with VTE were of similar age (60.3 vs 61.5 years, p=0.55) and body mass index (30.8 vs 30.2, p=0.56). Patients who developed a VTE had a longer length of stay (10 vs 8 days, p=0.02) and a more elevated admission white blood cell count (10.3 vs 8.4 k/uL, p=0.002), d-dimer (4.37 vs 1.67 ug/mL, p<0.001) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (474 vs 373 mg/dL, p=0.005). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19 who survive to discharge may be prone to developing VTE, though their baseline risk factors for COVID-19 related disease were the same as those without a VTE in our cohort. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Laboratory findings at the time of admission may help identify those patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of being diagnosed with VTE.

A better understanding of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response is necessary to finely evaluate commercial serological assays but also to predict protection against reinfection and to help the development of vaccines. For this reason, we monitored the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in infected patients. In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients 2 weeks post-symptom onset and that the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2, we also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 samples from asymptomatic individuals that were shown SARS-CoV-2 seropositive using commercial serological tests. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau 2 weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients but they were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic patients. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 does not induce a prolonged neutralizing antibody response. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Distribution and trafficking of JHM coronavirus structural proteins and virions in primary neurons and the OBL-21 neuronal cell line. The neurotropic murine coronavirus JHM is capable of inducing various forms of neurologic diseases, including demyelination. Neurons have been shown to act as a repository site at the early stages of the disease process (O. Sorensen and S. Dales, J. Virol. 56:434-438, 1985). JHM virus (JHMV) replication and trafficking of viral proteins and virions in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and a neuronal cell line, OBL-21, were examined, with an emphasis placed on the role of the microtubular network. We show here that JHMV spread within the central nervous system occurs transneuronally and that virus protein trafficking was dependent upon microtubules. Viral trafficking occurred asymmetrically, involving both the somatodendritic and the axonal domains. Thus coronavirus can be disseminated from neurons at either the basolateral or the apical domains. A specific interaction between antibodies derived against the microtubule-associated protein tau and JHMV nucleocapsid protein (N) was observed, which can presumably be explained by an overall amino acid similarity of 44% and an identity of 20% between proteins N and tau, with optimal alignment at the microtubule binding domain of tau. Collectively, our data suggest an important role of the microtubule network in viral protein trafficking and distribution. They also draw attention to protein sequence mimicry of a cell component by this coronavirus as one strategy for making use of the host's functions on behalf of the virus.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The UK Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has set the lowest level for defining sufficiency (10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L) of any national advisory body or scientific society and consequently recommends supplementation with 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day. We have searched for published evidence to support this but not found it. There is considerable evidence to support the higher level for sufficiency (20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and the American Institute of Medicine and hence greater supplementation (20 micrograms or 800 IU per day).

{"text": "Sudden cardiogenic shock mimicking fulminant myocarditis in a surviving teenager affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, myocardial injury is a relatively frequent finding. Progression to cardiogenic shock has been rarely described, especially in healthy young patients. The underlying mechanisms are to date controversial. A previously healthy 18-year-old female teenager affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) developed fulminant cardiogenic shock requiring a prompt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Cardiac involvement was predominant compared with the pulmonary one. Myocardial biopsies were performed; and in order to clarify the pathophysiology of the acute heart failure, optical and transmission electron microscopy study was realized. Two additional immunohistology techniques were developed in order to (i) detect a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant fusion nucleoprotein by using a specific antibody and (ii) study fractalkine expression induced by activated endothelium because this molecule is well known to be elevated in patients with severe cytokine release syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 genome was not detected in the myocardium. Even if the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, and cardiac imaging techniques strongly suggested fulminant myocarditis, histology and immunohistology were not fully consistent with this diagnosis according to the Dallas criteria. Although rare suspected coronavirus particles were found by transmission electron microscopy in the cardiac endothelium, neither significant immunoreactivity for the viral nucleocapsid protein nor image suggestive of endotheliitis was detected. Intense endothelial immunoreactivity pattern for fractalkine expression was observed. From a clinical point of view, the left ventricular systolic function gradually improved, and the patient survived after a long stay in the intensive care unit. Our observations suggest that a massive cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection was the main cause of the cardiogenic shock, making a direct viral injury pathway very unlikely.

Background Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death. Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta(2)GPI), and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies was not reported. Objective To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-beta(2)GPI antibodies. Methods ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events. Results Anti-beta(2)GPI IgG/IgA/IgM was the most frequent in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG/IgM was detected in 5.7/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by chemiluminescence. aPS/PT IgG/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association between thrombosis and aPL was found. Reactivity against domain 1 and 4-5 of beta(2)GPI was limited to 3/58 (5.2%) tested sera for each domain and did not correlate with aCL/anti-beta(2)GPI nor with thrombosis.

Objectives: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 mortality and morbidity is attributable to respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The pathogenesis underpinning coronavirus disease 2019-induced respiratory failure may be attributable to a dysregulated host immune response. Our objective was to investigate the pathophysiological relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and respiratory failure in severe coronavirus disease 2019., Design: Multicenter prospective observational study., Setting: ICU., Patients: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and noncoronavirus disease 2019 critically ill patients with respiratory failure (ICU control group)., Interventions: Daily measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines., Measurements and Main Results: Demographics, comorbidities, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory data were collected daily. Daily serum samples were drawn for measurements of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Pulmonary outcomes were the ratio of Pao2/Fio2 and static lung compliance. Twenty-six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and 22 ICU controls were enrolled. Of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 58% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 62% required mechanical ventilation, 12% underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 23% died. A negative correlation between interleukin-6 and Pao2/Fio2 (rho, -0.531; p = 0.0052) and static lung compliance (rho, -0.579; p = 0.033) was found selectively in the coronavirus disease 2019 group. Diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with significantly elevated serum interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta on the day of diagnosis., Conclusions: The inverse relationship between serum interleukin-6 and Pao2/Fio2 and static lung compliance is specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Similar observations were not found with interleukin-beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

{"text": "'POLIDON' Approach-A Novel Solution for the ENT & Skull Base Surgeons in COVID-19 era. Health care providers (HCP) of ENT and Skull base surgery are highly vulnerable and mostly infected by novel coronavirus as they have to examine and perform procedures directly in oral cavity, oropharynx, nose, nasopharynx, where coronavirus remains in plenty. ENT & Skull base surgeons need to do several aerosol generating procedures (AGP). Most of the endoscopic and microscopic ENT & skull base surgery are AGP; like-mastoid surgery, sinus surgery, surgery of pituitary, tympanomastoid paraganglioma, temporal bone malignancy, tracheostomy etc. All of we know, COVID negative by RT-PCR test is not always COVID negative. In COVID-19 pandemic-routine, even cancer surgeries are avoided or postponed for the sake of safety of HCPs. Moreover, in case of surgical emergency there's no way to refuse a patient for not having a report of COVID test. We thought about neutralizing or destroying the novel coronavirus from it's route of entry zone, as well as preventing aerosol to be transmitted in the air of OT. We designed a novel approach, i.e. 'POLIDON' (POLIDON = Polythene + Povidone Iodine), which can be the solution for these patients as well as surgeons or HCPs of above mentioned specialties. Use of Povidone Iodine as mouthwash and nasal spray or irrigation for both patient and HCPs prior to surgery is proposed. Then, use of simple polythene as barrier drape of patient or operative area for prevention of spread of aerosol in OT during surgery is the other component. With the POLIDON' approach-all these ENT & skull base surgeries can be done with more safety and confidence.

{"text": "COVID-19 patients in intensive care develop predominantly oliguric acute kidney injury. BACKGROUND: Acute kidney Injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk., METHODS: In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP-2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission., RESULTS: The majority (n=51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n=37, 65%) while stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30-day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n=9 (17%) patients., CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU develop AKI. The functional deficit is often low urinary volume, and initial levels of biomarkers are generally increased without clear relation to final AKI stage.

{"text": "Can the novel coronavirus be transmitted via RNAs without protein capsids?. The existing knowledge is insufficient to explain some infection events of SARS-CoV-2, and new ideas about the transmission modes may be needed. The present study proposes that the RNAs of this virus might be infectious and that the transmission of these RNAs might be one route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. I speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are infectious based on the following rationale and offer a putative mechanism: RNA is the most important biomolecule of the novel coronavirus for expression and replication, free RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to remain suspended in the air and retain their biological activity, and some exogenous RNAs can enter the host cell after contact. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. It is worthwhile to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 components (e.g., virus particles, positive RNA strands, negative RNA strands, and virus proteins) with symptoms to study the mechanism of asymptomatic infection. If additional detection results show that the proportion of RNA in the environment is higher than the proportion of RNA in the novel coronavirus particles, this would suggest the potential presence of free RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Research on the temporal and spatial distribution of infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA strands is necessary. The nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 should target not only positive RNA strands but also negative RNA strands. For medical purposes, studying environmental RNAs (eRNAs) is important. I believe that further investigation of the infection capabilities of viral RNAs will yield useful information.Copyright (c) 2020 Zhongneng Xu.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Human rhinovirus (HRV) accounts for a significant portion of common- cold illness, with the peak incidence being in the early fall. Three hundred forty-six adults who had self-diagnosed colds of 48 h or less were enrolled in a study during September and October 1994 to determine the frequency and clinical course of HRV infections. Nasal wash specimens for viral culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for HRV RNA and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E RNA detection were collected on enrollment, and participants recorded their symptoms twice daily for 14 days. Middle ear pressure (MEP) was measured with a digital tympanometer on days 1 and 7. Picornaviruses (224 HRV and 7 enterovirus isolates) were detected by culture in 67% (231 of 346) of the subjects. Among 114 samples negative by culture, HRV was detected by RT- PCR in 52 (46%) for an overall picornavirus infection rate of 82% (283 of 346 subjects). Among the remaining 62 negative samples, human coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 5 patients, so that 288 (83%) of patients had documented viral infection. The first symptom noticed most often was sore throat (40%) in HRV culture- or PCR-positive patients and stuffy nose in HRV- negative patients (27%). No differences in symptom scores over time or in the presence of individual symptoms were noted between groups. The median duration of the cold episodes was 11 days in HRV culture-positive patients, 9.5 days in HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 11.5 days in HRV-negative patients. On enrollment, abnormal MEPs (<=-100 or <=+100 mm of H2O) were found for 21% of HRV culture-positive patients, 14% of HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 10% of HRV-negative patients. No important differences in the clinical course of HRV culture-positive, HRV culture-negative and RT-PCR- positive, or HRV-negative colds were found. These results represent the highest frequency of virologically confirmed natural colds to date and document the importance of rhinoviruses as the cause of colds during fall months.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We investigated the serum cytokine and chemokine levels in asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected cases. Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production induced by SARS-CoV-2 were observed not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic cases, and returned to normal after recovery. IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-18, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10, MIG, and MIP-1alpha were found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, a set of cytokine and chemokine profiles were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected male than female patients. The serum levels of MCP-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were weakly and positively correlated with viral titers. We suggest that combinatorial analysis of serum cytokines and chemokines with clinical classification may contribute to evaluation of the severity of COVID-19 and optimize the therapeutic strategies.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "Immunity, endothelial injury and complement-induced coagulopathy in COVID-19. In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated from the respiratory epithelium of patients with unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, China. This pathogen, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a pathogenic condition that has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has reached pandemic proportions. As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases. In the early stages of the disease, most patients experience mild clinical symptoms, including a high fever and dry cough. However, 20% of patients rapidly progress to severe illness characterized by atypical interstitial bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Almost 10% of these critically ill patients subsequently die. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression are emerging and highlight the critical role of the immunological hyper-response - characterized by widespread endothelial damage, complement-induced blood clotting and systemic microangiopathy - in disease exacerbation. These insights may aid the identification of new or existing therapeutic interventions to limit the progression of early disease and treat severe cases.Copyright \u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a global threat due to substantial morbidity and mortality, and health education strategies need to be adjusted timely to prevent a possible epidemic rebound., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions of COVID-19 among individuals coming to, returning to, or living in the Jiangsu Province of China, and realize the impact of epidemic development on public's perceptions., METHODS: In this study, an online self-designed questionnaire was used between February 15 and April 21, 2020. Factors influencing the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score for COVID-19 were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) and its 95% credible interval were calculated and compared with the daily participation number and protection scores., RESULTS: A total of 52,066 participants were included in the study; their average knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were 25.58 (SD 4.22), 24.05 (SD 4.02), 31.51 (SD 2.84), and 90.02 (SD 8.87), respectively, and 65.91% (34,315/52,066) of them had a total protection score above 90 points. For the knowledge and skill sections, correct rates of questions on medical observation days, infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, cough or sneeze treatment, and precautions were higher than 95%, while those of questions on initial symptoms, transmission routes, selection of disinfection products, and measures of home quarantine were relatively low: 62.01%, 71.32%, 71.81%, and 76.90%, respectively. For the actual behavior section, 97.93% of participants could wear masks properly when going out. However, 19.76% could not disinfect their homes each week, and 18.42% could not distinguish the initial symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19. The regression analyses showed that the knowledge score, skill score, behavior score, and total score were influenced by sex, age, educational level, occupation, and place of residence at different degrees (P<.001). The government, television shows, and news outlets were the main sources for protection knowledge, and the information released by the government and authoritative medical experts was considered the most reliable. The current information needs included the latest epidemic development, disease treatment progress, and daily protection knowledge. The Rt in the Jiangsu Province and Chinese Mainland dropped below 1, while the global Rt remained at around 1. The maximal information coefficients (MICs) ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that public's perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic development., CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of the participants had better COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. It is then necessary to apply different health education measures based on the characteristics of resuming work and study to guide some specific populations to improve their protection perceptions ultimately to prevent the possible rebound of COVID-19., CLINICALTRIAL:", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "An ultrapotent synthetic nanobody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by stabilizing inactive Spike. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment, which enables aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia.

{"text": "Low incidence of COVID-19 in the West African sub-region: mitigating healthcare delivery system or a matter of time?. Background: This study examines the growth trends in the COVID-19 pandemic and fatalities arising from its complications among tested patients in West Africa. Countries around the world have employed several measures in order to control the spread of the disease. In spite of the poor state of the healthcare delivery system in West Africa, the spread of the pandemic is relatively low compared to reported cases in other regions of the world. The study addresses this phenomenon by asking the question: is the low incidence of COVID-19 in the West African sub-region a mitigating healthcare delivery system or just a matter of time? Methods: The study adopted a cross-sectional time series method. Data for Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Niger Republic, and global data were extracted from the World Health Organization COVID-19 databank. Data were extracted in intervals of 7 days from March 15 through April 19, 2020. Data regarding the incidence growth rate and fatalities arising from COVID-19 complications were generated from the total reported cases and fatalities over specified periods. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out using Stata version 14. Result(s): Results showed that the trends in growth patterns of COVID-19 for Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Republic of Niger, and West Africa generally followed the same fluctuating curves. The COVID-19 pandemic accounted for 92.3%, 97.8%, 90.3%, 65%, 90.4%, 93.6%, and 97% of complications that led to deaths of patients in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Niger Republic, Ivory Coast, and West Africa, respectively. Also, the results established that there was a significant positive association between increased incidence of COVID-19 and percentage increase in fatalities arising from its complications in West Africa (s = 0.032; t = 12.70; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The threat presently posed by COVID-19 seems to be minimal in West Africa despite the poor state of the healthcare delivery system in the region.

{"text": "The burden of anxiety among people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pune, India. INTRODUCTION: Globally, India has the third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited., METHODS: During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score >= 10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score >= 10 vs GAD-7 score < 10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis., RESULTS: Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income < 200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38 and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n = 41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score >= 10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p = 0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns., CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders on self-report anxiety and sleep quality, with a focus on sex differences. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased anxiety and decreased sleep quality, with stronger associations in women. METHOD(S): One hundred three participants (61 female, 38 +/- 1years) reported perceived changes in anxiety and sleep quality due to stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic and were administered the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Chi-square and T test analyses were utilized to assess sex differences in reported anxiety and sleep. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the associations between reported impact of COVID-19 and anxiety/sleep parameters. RESULT(S): Women (80.3%) reported higher prevalence of increased general anxiety due to COVID-19 when compared to men (50%; p = 0.001) and elevated STAI state anxiety compared to men (43 +/- 1 vs. 38 +/- 1a.u., p = 0.007). Despite these differences in anxiety, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on PSQI was not different between sexes.

INTRODUCTION: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major global health concern. Joint efforts for effective surveillance of COVID-19 require immediate transmission of reliable data. In this regard, a standardized and interoperable reporting framework is essential in a consistent and timely manner. Thus, this research aimed at to determine data requirements towards interoperability., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, a combination of literature study and expert consensus approach was used to design COVID-19 Minimum Data Set (MDS). A MDS checklist was extracted and validated. The definitive data elements of the MDS were determined by applying the Delphi technique. Then, the existing messaging and data standard templates (Health Level Seven-Clinical Document Architecture [HL7-CDA] and SNOMED-CT) were used to design the surveillance interoperable framework., RESULTS: The proposed MDS was divided into administrative and clinical sections with three and eight data classes and 29 and 40 data fields, respectively. Then, for each data field, structured data values along with SNOMED-CT codes were defined and structured according HL7-CDA standard., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The absence of effective and integrated system for COVID-19 surveillance can delay critical public health measures, leading to increased disease prevalence and mortality. The heterogeneity of reporting templates and lack of uniform data sets hamper the optimal information exchange among multiple systems. Thus, developing a unified and interoperable reporting framework is more effective to prompt reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak.

This study explored community hospital emergency department staff's perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. Result(s): Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincent's Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress. Conclusion(s): At baseline, providers reported caring for critically ill children, mass casualty events, and death of a patient as critical incidents, which typically occurred once per week. Death of a patient occurs at increased frequency during the protracted mass casualty experience of COVID-19 and threatens provider well-being. Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers' well-being during and after the pandemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in response to COVID-19: A study of the general population in China at the peak of its epidemic. Rationale: Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. Objective(s): This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Method(s): Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Result(s): The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized beta = -0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized beta = -0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized beta = -0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized beta = -0.256, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized beta = -0.268, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized beta = -0.236, P < 0.001; standardized beta = -0.126, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental illnesses among young people. Crisis like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the current prevalence of these illnesses. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to (1) explore the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among youth and (2) identify to what extent certain variables related to COVID-19 could predict depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) among young people in six different countries. Participants were requested to complete an online survey including demographics and the DAS scale. A total of 1,057 participants from Oman (n = 155), Saudi Arabia (n = 121), Jordan (n = 332), Iraq (n = 117), United Arab Emirates (n = 147), and Egypt (n = 182) completed the study. The total prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 57%, 40.5%, and 38.1%, respectively, with no significant differences between countries. Significant predictors of stress, anxiety, and depression were being female, being in contact with a friend and/or a family member with mental illness, being quarantined for 14 days, and using the internet. In conclusion, COVID-19 is an epidemiological crisis that is casting a shadow on youths' DAS. The restrictions and prolonged lockdowns imposed by COVID-19 are negatively impacting their level of DAS. Healthcare organisations, in collaboration with various sectors, are recommended to apply psychological first aid and design appropriate educational programmes to improve the mental health of youth.

The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of-Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population., METHOD: A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire., FINDINGS: The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p<0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p<0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p<0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week., INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3.1-3.6% for depressive disorders and 3.0-3.5% for anxiety disorders).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

BACKGROUND: The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants., METHODS: We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology., RESULTS: The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI=10.3-15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score., CONCLUSION: The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.

Objective: To evaluate a protocol of universal symptom and viral screening prior to initiation of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation among patients receiving care in New York City. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Material(s) and Method(s): Prior to initiation of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for oocyte cryopreservation or in vitro fertilization cycles, patients were screened by phone for symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, recent travel or contact with confirmed COVID cases. If negative, patients were scheduled for nasopharyngeal swabs at our center the following day, with visits spaced at 15 minute intervals to avoid crowding. Upon presentation for swab testing, patients were again screened for symptoms and fever. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in accordance with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, and delivered to the university's clinical microbiology laboratory. The swabs were tested using the Roche Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test, a qualitative assay, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Roche Diagnostics, USA), with results delivered in the same day. A negative test result was required prior to patients' baseline ultrasound and bloodwork the following morning. This study was conducted from April 21- May 21, 2020, Results: The study sample included 151 asymptomatic patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 149 (98.68%) tested negative for COVID-19, 1 (0.66%) tested indeterminate, 2 (1.32%) tested invalid, and 0 (0%) tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 149 patients who have tested negative, 81 have successfully undergone oocyte retrieval without complications. One patient screened positive for symptoms at the time of swab presentation and was instructed to return for testing in 2 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has shown preliminary signs of effectiveness in moderate to severely ill patients in reducing mortality1, 2 . While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to convalescent plasma is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult COVID-19 patients within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the FDA eIND and EAP approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics, clinical, and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed., RESULTS: Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and thirteen were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile non-hemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), allergic (1.8%), and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12-13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80-89 years., CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of CP as a safe therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.

The collection of nasopharyngeal swabs to test for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an invasive technique with implications for patients and clinicians. Alternative clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract may offer benefits in terms of collection, comfort and infection risk. The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tested saliva or nasal specimens compared with RT-PCR tested nasopharyngeal specimens. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and NHS evidence from December 2019 to 20 July 2020. Eighteen studies were identified; 12 for saliva, four for nasal and two included both specimen types. For saliva-based studies, the proportion of saliva samples testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 82.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 76.7% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 65.4% to 100%. For nasal-based studies, the proportion of nasal swabs testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 81.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 70% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 62.3% to 100%. The results indicate an inconsistency in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the specimen types included, often with neither the index nor the reference of interest detecting all known cases. Depending on the test environment, these clinical specimens may offer a viable alternative to standard.

{"text": "Neurological manifestations of Coronavirus Infections: Role of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in COVID-19. In December 2019, a highly pathogenic coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (formerly identified as2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan, China, and has since been spreading rapidly around the world. The most specific manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 patients is pulmonary distress, and several patients admitted to intensive care units were not able to breathe spontaneously. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has a significant effect on nervous systems and may even lead to serious neurological damage. The neuroinvasive pathobiology is still not fully elucidated and thus the effect of CoV infections on the nervous system needs to be explored. The spike protein of the virus and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) lead to the presence of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the cells and, subsequently,decreased ACE2 expression. The therapeutic possibilities of ACE2 antibody, ACE2-derived peptides, and small molecule blockers of ACE2 include a receptor-binding domain blocking approach. Hence,future studies of ACE2 may be very helpful in discovering a therapy for SARS-CoV-2.

{"text": "Pneumolysis and \"Silent Hypoxemia\" in COVID-19. COVID-19 can evolve to a severe lung compromise with life-threatening hypoxemia. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Their understanding is crucial to improve the outcomes. Initially, past-experience lead to the implementation of standardized protocols assuming this disease would be the same as SARS-CoV. Impulsive use of ventilators in extreme cases ended up in up to 88% fatality. We compare medical and physiological high altitude acute and chronic hypoxia experience with COVID-19 hypoxemia. A pathophysiological analysis is performed based on literature review and histopathological findings. Application of the Tolerance to Hypoxia formula = Hemoglobin/PaCO2 + 3.01 to COVID-19, enlightens its critical hypoxemia. Pneumolysis is defined as progressive alveolar-capillary destruction resulting from the CoV-2 attack to pneumocytes. The adequate interpretation of the histopathological lung biopsy photomicrographs reveals these alterations. The three theoretical pathophysiological stages of progressive hypoxemia (silent hypoxemia, gasping, and death zone) are described. At high altitude, normal low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels (with intact lung tissue and adequate acid-base status) could be considered silent hypoxemia. At sea level, in COVID-19, the silent hypoxemia starting at SpO2 <= 90% (comparable to a normal SPO2 {88-92%} at 3500 m) suddenly evolves to critical hypoxemia. This, as a consequence of progressive pneumolysis + inflammation + overexpressed immunity + HAPE-type edema resulting in pulmonary shunting. The proposed treatment is based on the improvement of the Tolerance to Hypoxia (Hemoglobin factor), oxygen therapy, inflammation reduction, antibiotics, antitussives, rehydration & anticoagulation if required.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide since its first incidence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the total fatality to surpass other viral diseases, reaching more than 1 million globally as of October 6, 2020. The rate at which the disease is spreading calls for a therapy that is useful for treating a large population. Multiple intersecting viral and host factor targets involved in the life cycle of the virus are being explored. Because of the frequent mutations, many coronaviruses gain zoonotic potential, which is dependent on the presence of cell receptors and proteases, and therefore the targeting of the viral proteins has some drawbacks, as strain-specific drug resistance can occur. Moreover, the limited number of proteins in a virus makes the number of available targets small. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common mechanisms of entry and replication, there are substantial differences in viral proteins such as the spike (S) protein. In contrast, targeting cellular factors may result in a broader range of therapies, reducing the chances of developing drug resistance. In this Review, we discuss the role of primary host factors such as the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cellular proteases of S protein priming, post-translational modifiers, kinases, inflammatory cells, and their pharmacological intervention in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

This may be due to higher frequency of comorbidities, but increased frailty and immunosenescence linked with aging may also contribute. Moreover, in elderly individuals, SARS-CoV-2 may adopt different molecular strategies to strongly impact on cardiac aging that culminate in exacerbating a pro-inflammatory state (cytokine storm activation), which, in turn, may lead to pulmonary vascular endothelialitis, microangiopathy, diffuse thrombosis, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes.

{"text": "Mini-Review on the Roles of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Selenium in the Immune System against COVID-19. Low levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections. Therefore, to maximize the nutritional defense against infections, a daily allowance of vitamins and trace elements for malnourished patients at risk of or diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be beneficial. Recent studies on COVID-19 patients have shown that vitamin D and selenium deficiencies are evident in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D improves the physical barrier against viruses and stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides. It may prevent cytokine storms by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. Selenium enhances the function of cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, selenium is important for maintaining T cell maturation and functions, as well as for T cell-dependent antibody production. Vitamin C is considered an antiviral agent as it increases immunity. Administration of vitamin C increased the survival rate of COVID-19 patients by attenuating excessive activation of the immune response. Vitamin C increases antiviral cytokines and free radical formation, decreasing viral yield. It also attenuates excessive inflammatory responses and hyperactivation of immune cells.

The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 may be due to various mechanisms such as direct invasion (due to the neurotropic properties of the virus) and indirect mechanisms (derived from the pro-inflammatory state, metabolic disorders, or dysregulation of the immune system). A review of the literature on the neurological clinical aspects of COVID-19 and neurological manifestations was performed.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Sociedad Neurologica Argentina", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Incidence, patterns, risk factors, and histopathological findings of liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a scoping review. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits many extrapulmonary manifestations, including liver injury. This scoping review aimed to provide insight into the incidence, patterns, risk factors, histopathological findings, and relationship with disease severity of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Furthermore, we identified existing gaps in the research on the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and highlighted areas for future investigations., METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis., RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult., CONCLUSIONS: Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised. Current use of hepatotoxic drugs necessitates close monitoring of liver function.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A Hydrophobic-Interaction-Based Mechanism Triggers Docking between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. A recent experimental study found that the binding affinity between the cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike (S) protein of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is more than tenfold higher than that of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, main chain structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are almost the same with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Understanding the physical mechanism responsible for the outstanding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 is an \"urgent challenge\" for developing blockers, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Taking into account the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surface tension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals a hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than that between SARS-CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portions of the hydrophilic side chains of SARS-CoV-2 S are found to be involved in the hydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2.

SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the new lung disease COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV, and together with MERS-CoV are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 outbreak is a rapidly evolving situation with higher transmissibility and infectivity compared with SARS and MERS. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe illness. The prevalent cause of mortality is pneumonia that progresses to ARDS. The ongoing pandemic has already resulted in more than 135,000 deaths and an unprecedented burden on national health systems worldwide. Pending the availability of a vaccine, there is a critical need to identify effective treatments and a number of clinical trials have been implemented worldwide. Trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other infections, have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy at present, as it is still unclear how well these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Most of those emerging re-introduced drugs are administered to patients in the context of clinical trials.

{"text": "Harnessing the immune system to overcome cytokine storm and reduce viral load in COVID-19: a review of the phases of illness and therapeutic agents. Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCov), a novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization by March 11th, 2020. Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a combination of direct tissue injury by viral replication and associated cytokine storm resulting in progressive organ damage. Discussion(s): We reviewed published literature between January 1st, 2000 and June 30th, 2020, excluding articles focusing on pediatric or obstetric population, with a focus on virus-host interactions and immunological mechanisms responsible for virus associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). COVID-19 illness encompasses three main phases. In phase 1, SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, triggering toll like receptor (TLR) mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling. It effectively blunts an early (IFN) response allowing unchecked viral replication. Phase 2 is characterized by hypoxia and innate immunity mediated pneumocyte damage as well as capillary leak. Some patients further progress to phase 3 characterized by cytokine storm with worsening respiratory symptoms, persistent fever, and hemodynamic instability. Important cytokines involved in this phase are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. This is typically followed by a recovery phase with production of antibodies against the virus. We summarize published data regarding virus-host interactions, key immunological mechanisms responsible for virus-associated CRS, and potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Conclusion(s): Evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with CRS and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and other therapeutic interventions.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 action on male gonadal function and fertility: Current status and future prospects. The novel coronavirus was recognised in December 2019 and caught humanity off guard. The virus employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into human cells. ACE2 is expressed on different organs, which is raising concern as to whether these organs can be infected by the virus or not. The testis appears to be an organ enriched with levels of ACE2, while the possible mechanisms of involvement of the male reproductive system by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully elucidated. The major focus of the present studies is on the short-term complications of the coronavirus and gains importance on studying the long-term effects, including the possible effects of the virus on the male reproductive system. The aim of this review was to provide new insights into different possible mechanisms of involvement of male gonads with SARS-CoV-2 including investigating the ACE2 axis in testis, hormonal alterations in patients with COVID-19, possible formation of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) and subsequently immunological infertility as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we suggest measuring the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) as a determiner of male fertility impairment in patients with COVID-19 along with other options such as sex-related hormones and semen analysis. Invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells can lead to sex hormonal alteration and impaired gonadal function. Once infected, changes in ACE2 signalling pathways followed by oxidative stress and inflammation could cause spermatogenesis failure, abnormal sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and male infertility.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is a new major concern and a global emergency in almost all countries worldwide; due to the higher sensibility of cancer patients, they are more susceptible to severe and fatal infections, being nearly 10 times more likely than in healthy individuals infected with this virus. Although the aggressive nature of a cancer is a matter of concern, our exact role as oncologists in this time of restricted resources is not fully clarified. Regarding some consensus recommendation for postponing surgery, there is still an essential need for a single approved protocol regarding each type of malignancy. Iran, as one of the first involved countries in this crisis in Asia, which also has a high prevalence of gynecological malignancies, will certainly require an individualized decision-making schedule based on the most accepted global consensus opinion. Considering our restricted health system resources, herein we tried to introduce a logical gynecologic cancer management protocol based on the stage and survival expectancy of each tumor, along with reviewing all recent recommendations. The limited statistics published in this short period of time have obliged us to mainly focus on expert opinions, and the individualized clinical judgments should be agreed upon by multidisciplinary tumor board consensus.

{"text": "Living with covid-19. From the beginning of 2020, the alarming news from Italy and the first known cases arrived in Greece, along with travelers from the Holy Land. Spain, France and all other countries followed. From the first week of March, restrictive measures began in Greece and then confinement in order to limit the spread of the pandemic and not drown the National Health System by serious cases. The policy of restrictive measures to stop the pandemic was the internationally accepted response1 and the generalized adherence proved effective, despite the shock and the various reactions from the unprecedented, generalized state of restriction, different scale from epidemics of other times.2-4 In other countries, the loose restrictive measures have cost thousands of deaths. The general restrictive measures, however, have serious consequences for people's mental equilibrium, economy and employment, and for this reason they can only be of limited duration.5 The gradual return to normal life rhythms began gradually from May. But the test of the holiday time and the gradual opening of the tourist season, that is, the open communication of moving populations with limited, random checks for the virus and only local restrictions of the gathering of citizens. We are experiencing now the gradual and severe increase in cases, with an uncertain spreading, with asymptomatic and younger in age likely playing a central role in the spread of the virus, while the fear of a potential large increase in serious cases remains. At the time of this writing, the only means of coping is to maintain and locally strengthen the protective measures, while we gradually realize that these measures came to stay for many more months.6,7 A major problem is that the initial small number of cases favored the underestimation of risk by part of the population, and the serious consequences on people's jobs and lives, along with the deregulation of employment and social security relations legislated in recent months, have provided substantial material to conspiracy theories. We carefully monitor the research on the epidemiological behavior of covid-19 and the clinical data, the discussion on the drugs that make the symptoms milder, the effect of the virus on the CNS and the expected vaccine or vaccines. Our role from the beginning concerned the enormous psychological burden of a global health crisis, with serious consequences on people's working and social lives and equally avoiding the deregulation of the management of our patients and of the units that provide it. At the time of confinement, the telephone contact, familiar to all generations, offered valuable information and support, the lines 10306 and 1110, as well as many local or voluntary help-lines. Telepsychiatry was used more widely - being also an initiative of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association - and seems to have entered impetuously in our work, as well as in education. Its central or complementary role and its safe use are issues that are widely discussed at the moment.8 Protection measures against the virus seriously affect the normal functioning of health and mental health services. The solution should be sought in the urgent operational upgrade, the very necessary reinforcement of the staff and its effective protection from the virus and stress from exposure to danger, which has emerged as important factors for the normal operation of the mental health units.9 The use of telepsychiatry has solved a number of operational problems, but in many cases, it remains complementary, as it cannot replace physical presence in more specific care operations. The need not only to normalize, but to improve the follow up of our patients, the need to strengthen the units that provide basic, community mental health services, is shown by the increase in cases of involuntary hospitalization in the psychiatric hospitals of Athens and Thessaloniki during the last two months. A health crisis that affects almost the entire planet and the working and social life of most is a major social and political problem that concerns all of us,10 while mental health professionals are called to offer their scientific tools for people to face a multifaceted threat and in particular to claim and ensure the continuation of the treatment of our patients and the normal operation of our units.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Kinetics and isotype assessment of antibodies targeting the spike protein receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 in COVID-19 patients as a function of age, biological sex and disease severity. Objectives: There is an incomplete understanding of the host humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, which underlies COVID-19, during acute infection. Host factors such as age and sex as well as the kinetics and functionality of antibody responses are important factors to consider as vaccine development proceeds. The receptor-binding domain of the CoV spike (RBD-S) protein mediates host cell binding and infection and is a major target for vaccine design to elicit neutralising antibodies., Methods: We assessed serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-S IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies by a two-step ELISA and neutralising antibodies in a cross-sectional study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients of varying disease severities. Anti-RBD-S IgG levels were also determined in asymptomatic seropositives., Results: We found equivalent levels of anti-RBD-S antibodies in male and female patients and no age-related deficiencies even out to 93 years of age. The anti-RBD-S response was evident as little as 6 days after onset of symptoms and for at least 5 weeks after symptom onset. Anti-RBD-S IgG, IgM and IgA responses were simultaneously induced within 10 days after onset, with anti-RBD-S IgG sustained over a 5-week period. Anti-RBD-S antibodies strongly correlated with neutralising activity. Lastly, anti-RBD-S IgG responses were higher in symptomatic COVID-19 patients during acute infection compared with asymptomatic seropositive donors., Conclusion: Our results suggest that anti-RBD-S IgG reflect functional immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, but do not completely explain age- and sex-related disparities in COVID-19 fatalities.

{"text": "Seasonal incidence of respiratory viral infections in Telangana, India: utility of a multiplex PCR assay to bridge the knowledge gap. Objective: The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. Method(s): A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. Result(s): Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. Conclusion(s): There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late November 2019 in Wuhan, China. Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from 24 December 2019, to 13 May 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (>10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein, and one in each of three proteins: Spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate which makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

There are currently around 200 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials throughout the world. The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical.

We assembled a transdisciplinary team of knowledgeable and dedicated physicians, scientists, technologists, and administrators who rapidly built a multiplatform, polymerase chain reaction- and serology-based detection program, established drive-through facilities, and drafted and implemented guidelines that enabled efficient testing of our patients and employees. This process was extremely complex, due to the limited availability of needed reagents, but outreach to our research scientists and multiple diagnostic laboratory companies, and government officials enabled us to implement both Food and Drug Administration authorized and laboratory-developed testing-based testing protocols. We analyzed our workforce needs and created teams of appropriately skilled and certified workers to safely process patient samples and conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing.

The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Furthermore, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact-tracing is time-consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously over-load public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for policymakers on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity. The prediction model uses k-means algorithm as an unsupervised machine learning technique for lockdown management.

Approximately 17 years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic, the world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to the most optimistic projections, it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, so the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virusspecific targets for small molecule-based interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed 21 ribosomal frameshift (21 PRF) to control the relative expression of their proteins. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV have revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that stimulates high 21 PRF rates and that it also harbors a 21 PRF attenuation element. Altering 21 PRF activity impairs virus replication, suggesting that this activity may be therapeutically targeted. Here, we comparatively analyzed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV- 2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar 21 PRF rates and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablate 21 PRF activity. We noted that the upstream attenuator hairpin activity is also functionally retained in both viruses, despite differences in the primary sequence in this region. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit21 PRF was similarly effective against 21 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may be promising lead compounds to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 Kelly et al.Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc..

Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and high prevalence of the infected patients, the drugs and the therapies of other past viral epidemics have been used for this disease. Many studies have been performed on the specific treatments to find whether or not they are effective on COVID-19 patients. In this review, we collected information about the most widely used drugs to treat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) belonging to groups of antivirals, antibiotics, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. Some of these compounds and drugs were used directly by inpatients, so researchers have examined others in laboratory conditions. This study considered the pros and cons of using these treatments separately and together and compared their results. By studying this review, we hope to provide useful information for researchers.

{"text": "Rapid High-Yield Production of Functional SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain by Viral and Non-Viral Transient Expression for Pre-Clinical Evaluation. Vaccine design strategies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are focused on the Spike protein or its subunits as the main antigen target of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we propose rapid production methods of an extended segment of the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in HEK293SF cells cultured in suspension, in serum-free media, as a major component of a COVID-19 subunit vaccine under development. The expression of RBD, engineered with a sortase-recognition motif for protein-based carrier coupling, was achieved at high yields by plasmid transient transfection or human type-5-adenoviral infection of the cells, in a period of only two and three weeks, respectively. Both production methods were evaluated in 3L-controlled bioreactors with upstream and downstream bioprocess improvements, resulting in a product recovery with over 95% purity. Adenoviral infection led to over 100 microg/mL of RBD in culture supernatants, which was around 7-fold higher than levels obtained in transfected cultures. The monosaccharide and sialic acid content was similar in the RBD protein from the two production approaches. It also exhibited a proper conformational structure as recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against key native Spike epitopes. Efficient direct binding to ACE2 was also demonstrated at similar levels in RBD obtained from both methods and from different production lots. Overall, we provide bioprocess-related data for the rapid, scalable manufacturing of low cost RBD based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, with the added value of making a functional antigen available to support further research on uncovering mechanisms of virus binding and entry as well as screening for potential COVID-19 therapeutics.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Impact of Social Distancing on Incidence of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, South Korea. BACKGROUND: While vaccination remains the cornerstone of controlling vaccine-preventive diseases (VPD), little is known about the effect of social distancing on incidence of VPDs. We investigated the impact of social distancing practiced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on the incidence of selected VPDs in South Korea. METHOD(S): National surveillance data on monthly incidence of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and pertussis were retrieved and compared the VPD incidences in 2020 to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019) of the corresponding months. RESULT(S): In 2020, there were 44% decline for mumps, 44% decline for varicella, 28% decline for pertussis, 22% decline for IPD, 14% decline in incidence of hepatitis A, and no change for hepatitis B incidences, compared to baseline years (2015-2019). The largest decline of total VPDs were in April (65%) and in May (67%), during the intensified social distancing measures. CONCLUSION(S): In the setting of sustained vaccination coverage, social distancing may provide additional public health benefit in controlling the VPDs. This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Deep learning analysis provides accurate COVID-19 diagnosis on chest computed tomography. INTRODUCTION: Computed Tomography is an essential diagnostic tool in the management of COVID-19. Considering the large amount of examinations in high case-load scenarios, an automated tool could facilitate and save critical time in the diagnosis and risk stratification of the disease., METHODS: A novel deep learning derived machine learning (ML) classifier was developed using a simplified programming approach and an open source dataset consisting of 6868 chest CT images from 418 patients which was split into training and validation subsets. The diagnostic performance was then evaluated and compared to experienced radiologists on an independent testing dataset. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Operating points with high positive (>10) and low negative (<0.01) likelihood ratios to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present were identified and validated., RESULTS: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.956 (AUC) on an independent testing dataset of 90 patients. Both rule-in and rule out thresholds were identified and tested. At the rule-in operating point, sensitivity and specificity were 84.4 % and 93.3 % and did not differ from both radiologists (p>0.05). At the rule-out threshold, sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (60 %) differed significantly from the radiologists (p<0.05). Likelihood ratios and a Fagan nomogram provide prevalence independent test performance estimates., CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 using a basic deep learning approach is feasible using open-source CT image data. In addition, the machine learning classifier provided validated rule-in and rule-out criteria could be used to stratify the risk of COVID-19 being present. Copyright \u00a9 2020.

{"text": "Folate intake, markers of folate status and oral clefts: An updated set of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. BACKGROUND: There has been a longstanding debate about the role of folate in the etiology of orofacial clefts (OFCs). Studies of different measures of nutritional intake or folate status have been done to investigate the possible role of folate in the prevention of OFC. Only one knowledge synthesis has attempted to bring together different types of evidence. The aim of the present work was to update it., METHODS: Evidence for associations between OFC and dietary folate, supplement use, folic acid fortification, biomarkers of folate status, and variants of MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) were included. Potentially eligible articles were systematically identified from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (2007-2020) and combined using random-effects meta-analysis when appropriate. Quality assessments were conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane's risk of bias tool., RESULTS: Sixty-four studies published since the previous knowledge synthesis were identified, with eight of these identified through a supplementary search from October, 2018 to August, 2020. There was an inverse association between folic acid-containing supplement use before or during pregnancy and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), with considerable between-study heterogeneity. The prevalence of CL/P showed a small decline post-folic acid fortification in seven studies (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02). No association was found between OFC and genetic markers of folate status. The coronavirus-19 pandemic has threatened food availability globally and therefore there is a need to maintain and even enhance surveillance concerning maternal intake of folate and related vitamins., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of non-syndromic OFC was reduced among pregnant women with folic acid-containing supplements during the etiologically relevant period. However, high heterogeneity between included studies, incomplete reporting of population characteristics and variation in timing of exposure and supplement types mean that conclusions should be drawn with caution.

{"text": "Possible vertical transmission and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mothers with COVID-19: A living systematic review. Current evidence suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is predominantly transmitted from human-to-human. However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/ MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95%CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, 6 studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/ M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95%CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49AU/mL (range: 7.25AU/mL-140.32AU/mL) and 3.79AU/mL (range: 0.16AU/mL-45.83AU/mL), p = 0.0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of hospitalised current smokers and COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It produces severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, characterised by the cytokine release syndrome (CRS). According to the World Health Organization, those who smoke are likely to be more vulnerable to infection. Here, in order to clarify the epidemiologic relationship between smoking and COVID-19, we present a systematic literature review until 28th April 2020 and a meta-analysis. We included 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies based on smoking patient status from 720 initial studies in China, the USA, and Italy. The percentage of hospitalised current smokers was 7.7% (95% CI: 6.9-8.4) in China, 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7-2.9) in the USA and 7.6% (95% CI: 4.2-11.0) in Italy. These percentages were compared to the smoking prevalence of each country and statistically significant differences were found in them all (p <0.0001). By means of the meta-analysis, we offer epidemiological evidence showing that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalised (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.14-0.23, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the analysis of data from 18 studies shows a much lower percentage of hospitalised current smokers than expected. As more studies become available, this trend should be checked to obtain conclusive results and to explore, where appropriate, the underlying mechanism of the severe progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

We present a meta-analysis of 176 published cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections that were defined by at least one positive nasopharyngeal swab and/or the presence of specific IgM. We report that 70% and 30% of infections are due to environmental and vertical transmission, respectively.

The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases. BCG vaccination has recently been proposed as a strategy to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, supported by its potential to boost innate immunity and initial epidemiological analyses which observed reduced severity of COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccination policies. Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively.

It is hypothesized that BCG and other childhood vaccinations may provide some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection through trained or adaptive immune responses. Here, we tested whether BCG, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae, Hepatitis B, Meningococcal, Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccines provide cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice.

{"text": "Social media and vaccine hesitancy. BACKGROUND: Understanding the threat posed by anti-vaccination efforts on social media is critically important with the forth coming need for world wide COVID-19 vaccination programs. We globally evaluate the effect of social media and online foreign disinformation campaigns on vaccination rates and attitudes towards vaccine safety., METHODS: Weuse a large-n cross-country regression framework to evaluate the effect ofsocial media on vaccine hesitancy globally. To do so, we operationalize social media usage in two dimensions: the use of it by the public to organize action(using Digital Society Project indicators), and the level of negative lyoriented discourse about vaccines on social media (using a data set of all geocoded tweets in the world from 2018-2019). In addition, we measure the level of foreign-sourced coordinated disinformation operations on social media ineach country (using Digital Society Project indicators). The outcome of vaccine hesitancy is measured in two ways. First, we use polls of what proportion ofthe public per country feels vaccines are unsafe (using Wellcome Global Monitor indicators for 137 countries). Second, we use annual data of actual vaccination rates from the WHO for 166 countries., RESULTS: We found the use of social media to organise offline action to be highly predictive of the belief that vaccinations are unsafe, with such beliefs mounting as more organisation occurs on social media. In addition, the prevalence of foreign disinformation is highly statistically and substantively significant in predicting a drop in mean vaccination coverage over time. A 1-point shift upwards in the 5-point disinformation scale is associated with a 2-percentage point drop in mean vaccination coverage year over year. We also found support for the connection of foreign disinformation with negative social media activity about vaccination. The substantive effect of foreign disinformation is to increase the number of negative vaccine tweets by 15% for the median country., CONCLUSION: There is a significant relationship between organisation on social media and public doubts of vaccine safety. In addition, there is a substantial relationship between foreign disinformation campaigns and declining vaccination coverage. Copyright \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

{"text": "Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health status of undergraduate medical students in a COVID-19 treating medical college: a prospective longitudinal study. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is found to affect the mental health of the population. Undergraduate medical students are especially prone to mental health disorders and hence could be more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic., Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 217 undergraduate medical students in a medical college at Chennai, India. Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were recorded using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Items (DASS21) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in India in December 2019 and June 2020, respectively. In the follow-up survey, in addition to DASS21, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 related stressors were used. The self-administered questionnaire assessed the status of COVID-19 testing, interactions with COVID-19 patients, self-perceived levels of concerns and worries related to academics (COVID-19-AA (academic apprehensions)) and those pertaining to the self and family/friends (COVID-19-GA (general apprehensions)). Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of overall scores of depression, anxiety, and stress and scores stratified by gender, year of study, place of residence and monthly family income were performed. Predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 were investigated using adjusted binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant., Results: The average scores of depression, anxiety, and stress during the baseline survey were 7.55 +/- 7.86, 4.6 +/- 6.19 and 7.31 +/- 7.34 with the prevalence (95% Cl) of 33.2% [27-39.9%], 21.2% [16-27.2%] and 20.7% [15.5-26.7%]; in follow-up survey, the mean scores were 8.16 +/- 8.9, 6.11 +/- 7.13 and 9.31 +/- 8.18 with the prevalence being 35.5% [29.1-42.2%], 33.2% [27-39.9%] and 24.9% [19.3-31.2%] for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress (P < 0.001), with depression remaining unchanged during COVID-19, irrespective of gender, year of study, place of residence and family's monthly income. Poor sleep quality, higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, higher COVID-19-GA, COVID-19 patients in family/friends and direct interactions with COVID-19 patients were found to be significant predictors of negative mental health in undergraduate medical students. COVID-19-AA was not significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress., Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to negatively affect the mental health of the undergraduate medical students with the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress being increased, and depression symptoms remaining unaltered. Addressing and mitigating the negative effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of this population is crucial. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Saraswathi et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

A polyethyleneimine (PEI)-assisted copper in-situ growth (CISG) strategy was proposed as a controlled signal amplification strategy to enhance the sensitivity of gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow sensors (AuNP-LFS). The controlled signal amplification is achieved by introducing PEI as a structure-directing agent to regulate the thermodynamics of anisotropic Cu nanoshell growth on the AuNP surface, thus controlling shape and size of the resultant AuNP@Cu core-shell nanostructures and confining free reduction and self-nucleation of Cu2+ for improved reproducibility and decreased false positives. The PEI-CISG-enhanced AuNP-LFS showed ultrahigh sensitivities with the detection limits of 50 fg mL-1 for HIV-1 capsid p24 antigen and 6 CFU mL-1 for Escherichia coli O157:H7. We further demonstrated its clinical diagnostic efficacy by configuring PEI-CISG into a commercial AuNP-LFS detection kit for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. Altogether, this work provides a reliable signal amplification platform to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of AuNP-LFS for rapid and accurate diagnostics of various infectious diseases.

PubMed and Embase were searched until September 2020 to identify studies assessing characteristics of recurrence and nonrecurrence subjects after discharge. Random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool estimates of odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across studies. Meta-analysis data were available for age, sex, hospital duration, disease severity, seven comorbidities, five symptoms, five indexes of blood routine, nine indexes of blood biochemistry, four treatment therapies, two antibodies, and history of high-risk contact. Among them, hospital duration of recurrence cases was significantly shorter than nonrecurrence subjects (WMD, -1.55 days; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.45). Fatigue, positive Immunoglobulin M (IgM), and positive IgG were associated with an increased risk of recurrence cases, with ORs and 95% CIs of 4.06 (1.14-14.4), 2.95 (1.15-7.61), and 3.45 (1.58-7.54), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic, raising widespread public health concerns. Our team treated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, and we suspected that SARS-CoV-2 may cause testicular infection in male patients. We conducted this study to explore that observation., METHODS: We enrolled male patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and performed a bedside ultrasound (US) examination of the scrotum, focused on findings of acute inflammation such as tunica albuginea thickening, enlargement and heterogeneous echogenicity of the testis, epididymis, or both, an abscess, scrotal wall edema, and hydrocele. Then we compared the proportions of observed epididymo-orchitis in patients from different age groups and COVID-19 severity groups., RESULTS: A total of 142 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study, and 32 (22.5%) patients had acute orchitis, epididymitis, or epididymo-orchitis on scrotal US imaging, according to the diagnosis criteria. The observed risk of acute scrotal infection increased with age, with the incidence reaching 53.3% in men older than 80 years. We also observed that men with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher possibility of epididymo-orchitis compared to the nonsevere COVID-19 group (P = .037)., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows US imaging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may cause infection of the testis or epididymis, and the risk is worthy of the attention of clinicians.

While mortality (OR=0.67, 95%-CI 0.49-0.91) and supraglottic airway use (OR=0.36, 95%-CI 0.27-0.46) was higher during the pandemic, automated external defibrillator use (OR=1.78 95%-CI 1.06-2.98), return of spontaneous circulation (OR=1.63, 95%CI 1.18-2.26) and intubation (OR=1.87, 95%-CI 1.12--3.13) was more common before the pandemic. More patients survived to hospital admission (OR=1.75, 95%-CI 1.42-2.17) and discharge (OR=1.65, 95%-CI 1.28-2.12) before the pandemic. Bystander CPR (OR=1.18, 95%-CI 0.95-1.46), unwitnessed OHCA (OR=0.84, 95%-CI 0.66-1.07), paramedic-resuscitation attempts (OR=1.19 95%-CI 1.00-1.42) and mechanical CPR device use (OR=1.57 95%-CI 0.55-4.55) did not defer significantly., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality following OHCA was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"text": "Can pollen explain the seasonality of flu-like illnesses in the Netherlands?. Current models for flu-like epidemics insufficiently explain multi-cycle seasonality. Meteorological factors alone, including the associated behavior, do not predict seasonality, given substantial climate differences between countries that are subject to flu-like epidemics or COVID-19. Pollen is documented to be allergenic, it plays a role in immuno-activation and defense against respiratory viruses, and seems to create a bio-aerosol that lowers the reproduction number of flu-like viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that pollen may explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, in combination with meteorological variables. We have tested the Pollen-Flu Seasonality Theory for 2016-2020 flu-like seasons, including COVID-19, in the Netherlands, with its 17.4 million inhabitants. We combined changes in flu-like incidence per 100 K/Dutch residents (code: ILI) with pollen concentrations and meteorological data. Finally, a predictive model was tested using pollen and meteorological threshold values, inversely correlated to flu-like incidence. We found a highly significant inverse correlation of r(224) = -0.41 (p < 0.001) between pollen and changes in flu-like incidence, corrected for the incubation period. The correlation was stronger after taking into account the incubation time. We found that our predictive model has the highest inverse correlation with changes in flu-like incidence of r(222) = -0.48 (p < 0.001) when average thresholds of 610 total pollen grains/m3, 120 allergenic pollen grains/m3, and a solar radiation of 510 J/cm2 are passed. The passing of at least the pollen thresholds, preludes the beginning and end of flu-like seasons. Solar radiation is a co-inhibitor of flu-like incidence, while temperature makes no difference. However, higher relative humidity increases with flu-like incidence. We conclude that pollen is a predictor of the inverse seasonality of flu-like epidemics, including COVID-19, and that solar radiation is a co-inhibitor, in the Netherlands.

Objective This study aimed to estimate and investigate the prevalence and the risk factors implicated in contact dermatitis among healthcare workers in the Al'Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional survey among healthcare workers at hospitals in the Al'Qassim region. Data was collected using a standardized and validated Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire version 2002. We included 408 participants in the analysis. Results The majority of the respondents (66.7%) were females. The mean age of participants was 34 (SD: +/- 9) years. Most of the participants who reported contact dermatitis were nurses (58.6%). Direct patient care roles represent 78% of participants. Respondents who work 40-50 hours per week represent 61.5% of the sample. The most commonly recorded symptoms were dryness (92.9%), itchiness (50%), and redness (46.4%) of the skin. The most affected site was hand 93.5%. Hand cleanser was the commonest substance implicated in the worsening of the skin changes (59.2%). Protective glove material that worsens contact dermatitis, such as natural rubber/latex, represents 76% of responses. A significant association (p=0.001)was seen in the occurrence of contact dermatitis in those with a history of allergic eye symptoms (33.3%) and those without (58%). Participants with a mean age of 26.47 years were more prone to develop contact dermatitis (CI: 1.19-7.06; p=0.067). Pharmacists and interns had 3.69 and 4.90 times higher odds of having contact dermatitis (CI: 0.95-7.33; CI: 22.1; p=0.027; p=0.038, respectively). Those involved in patient education and research activities at work were 6.48 (p=0.017) and 20.51 (p=0.024) times likely to develop contact dermatitis (CI: 1.38-30.31; CI: 1.49-282.15, respectively). Conclusions We explored the prevalence and risk factors for occupational contact dermatitis among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. The prevalence of reported skin changes during the pandemic was 46.4%.

{"text": "Postoperative mortality among surgical patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic puts perioperative providers and staff at risk of viral exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) during aerosol-generating procedures, particularly in asymptomatic carriers.However, the perioperative risk for adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients remain uncertain and the topic of debate. The current study was designed to determine the postoperative mortality in COVID-19 patients based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the global published peer-reviewed literature. Method(s): A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 29, 2019, to August15, 2020, without language restriction. All observational studies reporting the prevalence of mortality were included while case reports and reviews were excluded. The data from each study were extracted with two independent authors with a customized format excel sheet and the disagreements were resolved by the third author. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a standardized critical appraisal Tool adapted from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Result(s): A total of 715 articles were identified from different databases and 45 articles were selected for evaluation after the successive screening. Twenty-three articles with 2947 participants were included. The meta-analysis revealed a very high global rate of postoperative mortality among COVID-19 patients of 20% (95% CI: 15 to 26) and a postoperative ICU admission rate of 15% (95% confidence interval (CI):10 to 21). Conclusion(s): The unexpected high postoperative mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of 20% in the global literature mandates further scrutiny in assuring appropriate surgical indications and perioperative surgical safety measures in this vulnerable cohort of patients.

Healthcare workers (HCW) are confronting great mental stressors in coping with the crisis. In Saudi Arabia, research on the psychological effect of COVID-19 on HCW is lacking., Aim: To evaluate COVID-19 psychological impact on HCW and determine anxiety predictors to identify high-risk individuals., Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on HCW in First Health Cluster Institutes in Eastern Province. An English self-administered questionnaire was adopted from similar research done in China. The original questionnaires were modified to meet the objectives of our study and suit Saudi sociodemographic differences. Generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale was incorporated to be the main tool for assessing the psychological impact., Results: One-third of HCW were classified as having anxiety disorder. In univariate analyses, the age group in years (P = 0.026), gender (P = 0.001), nationality (P = 0.033), and living with family (P = 0.007) significantly influenced anxiety disorder.

{"text": "Epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic infection cases of COVID-19 in Guangdong province. Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of the cases firstly reported as \"asymptomatic infection of COVID-19\" in Guangdong province. Method(s): The follow-up observation method was used to continuously track and observe the cases firstly reported as \"asymptomatic patients with COVID-19\" in Guangdong province from January 14 to March 31, 2020. The epidemiological data of the cases were collected to analyze their epidemiological characteristics, outcome and influencing factors. Result(s): From January 14 to March 31, 2020, a total of 325 cases were firstly reported as \"asymptomatic infections of COVID-19\" in Guangdong province. The epidemic curve of asymptomatic infection cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and it had two peaks. The first peak was from January 27 to February 5, and the second peak was from March 17 to March 26. Of the 325 cases, 184 (56.6%) were subsequently converted to confirmed cases. These cases were defined as incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. The age median of the cases was 40 years, and 93.5% (172/184) of the cases showed symptoms within 3 days after the first positive nucleic acid tests were conducted, and 141 (43.4%) of the 325 cases remained asymptomatic status until they were cured and discharged. They were inapparent infection cases, accounting for 8.6% (141/1 642) of those diagnosed with COVID-19 in Guangdong province during the same period. The age median of inapparent infection cases was 27 years. The median of the interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and discharge was 14 days. Up to 90.8% (138/141) of the inapparent infection cases were discharged for centralized medical observation within 28 days. The longest interval between the first positive nucleic acid test and the last positive nucleic acid test was 73 days. The positive rate of nucleic acid test was 0.3% in close contacts of inapparent infection cases and 2.2% in close contacts of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases. There were significant differences in age distribution and source of infection between incubation period asymptomatic infection cases and inapparent infection cases (P<0.05). Old age was the risk factor for the conversion of firstly reported asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases. Compared with the 0-19-year-old group, The patients aged 40-59 years and 60 years and above were more likely to become confirmed cases. The OR (95%CI) values were 2.730 (1.380-5.402) and 5.302 (2.199-12.783), and P values were 0.004 and 0.000, respectively. People being infected in China were more likely to become confirmed cases (OR=7.121, P=0.000). Conclusion(s): There were asymptomatic infection cases among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The infectiousness of incubation period asymptomatic infection cases might be stronger than that of inapparent infection cases. The proportion of younger cases among asymptomatic infection cases was higher than that of the confirmed cases. Old age and domestic infection were the risk factors for the conversion of asymptomatic infection cases to confirmed cases, to which more attention should be paid.

Introduction: As the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become increasingly politicized in the United States (US), political party affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. We examined differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates stratified by governor party affiliation across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC)., Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining daily COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 through September 30, 2020, for each US state and DC. We fit a Bayesian negative binomial model to estimate adjusted daily risk ratios (RRs) and posterior intervals (PIs) comparing infection and death rates by gubernatorial (mayoral for DC) party affiliation. We adjusted for several state-level variables, including population density, age, race, poverty, and health., Results: From March to early June 2020, Republican-led states had, on average, lower COVID-19 incidence rates compared to Democratic-led states. However, on June 8, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had higher per capita COVID-19 incidence rates (RR=1.15, 95% PI: 1.02, 1.25). This trend persisted until September 30 (RR=1.26, 95% PI: 0.96, 1.51). For death rates, Republican-led states had lower average rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 13 (RR=1.22, 95% PI: 1.03,1.37) through September 30 (RR=1.74, 95% PI: 1.20, 2.24)., Conclusion: Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the US. As attitudes toward the pandemic become increasingly polarized, policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than political ideology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

To circumvent the devastating pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, a humanized decoy antibody (ACE2-Fc fusion protein) was designed to target the interaction between viral spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we demonstrated that ACE2-Fc could specifically abrogate virus replication by blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing pseudotyped virus into both ACE2-expressing lung cells and lung organoids. The impairment of viral entry was not affected by virus variants, since efficient inhibition was also observed in six SARS-CoV-2 clinical strains, including the D614G variants which have been shown to exhibit increased infectivity. The preservation of peptidase activity also enables ACE2-Fc to reduce the angiotensin II-mediated cytokine cascade. Furthermore, this Fc domain of ACE2-Fc was shown to activate NK cell degranulation after coincubation with Spike-expressing H1975 cells. These promising characteristics potentiate the therapeutic prospects of ACE2-Fc as an effective treatment for COVID-19. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to characterize the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and concurrent elevated left heart filling pressure in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 patients has evidence of pulmonary hypertension associated with elevated left heart filling pressure on transthoracic echocardiography., Design: Retrospective cohort study., Setting: Academic tertiary-care center., Patients: Hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who underwent clinical transthoracic echocardiography., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: The exposure variable of interest was right ventricular systolic pressure, calculated using the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as right ventricular systolic pressure greater than 40 mm Hg. Left heart filling pressure was estimated with Nagueh's method for pulmonary artery occlusion pressure using E/e' ratio, and normal was considered pulmonary artery occlusion pressure less than 16 mm Hg. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between the patients with and without pulmonary hypertension. A total of 73 patients (median age 66 yr [57-75 yr]; 46% women) were included. Median right ventricular systolic pressure was 39 mm Hg (interquartile range, 32-50 mm Hg), and 36 patients (49.3%) had evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypertension were more likely to require ICU admission (86% vs 65%; p = 0.035) and have acute respiratory distress syndrome (72% vs 49%; p = 0.0053) than those without. In-hospital mortality was 26% for those with pulmonary hypertension compared with 14% for those without (p = 0.19).

{"text": "Restricted Prevalence Rates of COVID-19's Infectivity, Hospitalization, Recovery, Mortality in the USA and Their Implications. This article constructs and demonstrates an alternate probabilistic approach (using incidence rate restricted model), compared with the deterministic mathematical models such as SIR, to capture the impact of healthcare efforts on the prevalence rate of the COVID-19's infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality in the eastern, central, mountain, and pacific time zone states in the USA. We add additional new properties for the incidence rate restricted Poisson probability distribution. With new properties, our method becomes feasible to comprehend not only the patterns of the prevalence rate of the COVID-19's infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality but also to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of social distancing, healthcare management's efforts to hospitalize the patients, the patient's immunity to recover, and lastly the unfortunate mortality itself. To make regional comparisons (as the people's movement is far more frequent within than outside the regional zone on daily basis), we group the COVID-19 data in terms of eastern, central, mountain, and pacific zone states. Several non-intuitive findings in the data results are noticed. They include the existence of imbalance, different vulnerability, and risk reduction in these four regions. For example, the impact of healthcare efforts is high in the recovery category in the pacific states. The impact is less in the hospitalization category in the mountain states. The least impact is seen in the infectivity category in the eastern zone states. A few thoughts on future research work are cited.

Protective variables for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unknown. \"Trained immunity\" of the populace as a result of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of \"trained immunity\" or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 epidemiological data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity-a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations-is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality.

{"text": "Resilience strategies to manage psychological distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review. The COVID-19 pandemic marks an extraordinary global public health crisis unseen in the last century, with its rapid spread worldwide and associated mortality burden. The longevity of the crisis and disruption to normality is unknown. With COVID-19 set to be a chronic health crisis, clinicians will be required to maintain a state of high alert for an extended period. The support received before and during an incident is likely to influence whether clinicians experience psychological growth or injury. An abundance of information is emerging on disease epidemiology, pathogenesis and infection control prevention. However, literature on interventions for supporting the psychological well-being of healthcare workers during disease outbreaks is limited. This article summarises the available management strategies to increase resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. It focuses on self-care and organisational justice. It highlights various individual as well as organisational strategies. With the success of slowing disease spread in many countries to date, and reduced work-load due to limitations on elective surgery in many institutions, there is more time and opportunity to be pro-active in implementing measures to mitigate or minimise potential adverse psychological effects and improve, restore and preserve the well-being of the workforce now and for years to come. The purpose of this review is to review available literature on strategies for minimising the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinicians and to identify pro-active holistic approaches which may be beneficial for healthcare workers both for the current crisis and into the future.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Association of Anaesthetists", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

We aimed to describe rates and characterize predictors and health outcomes associated with AKI in a national cohort of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In a cohort of 5216 US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 identified through July 23, 2020, we described changes in serum creatinine and examined predictors of AKI and the associations between AKI, health resource utilization, and death, utilizing logistic regressions. We characterized geographic and temporal variations in AKI rates and estimated variance explained by key variables utilizing Poisson regressions., RESULTS: In total, 1655 (32%) participants had AKI; 961 (58%), 223 (13%), and 270 (16%) met Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions of stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI, respectively, and 201 (12%) received KRT. Eight percent of participants had AKI within 1 day of hospitalization, and 47% did not recover to baseline serum creatinine by discharge. Older age, Black race, male gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lower eGFR were significant predictors of AKI during hospitalization with COVID-19. AKI was associated with higher mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 6.46; 95% confidence interval, 5.52 to 7.57) and longer hospital stay (5.56 additional days; 95% confidence interval, 4.78 to 6.34). AKI was also associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 6.71; 95% confidence interval, 5.62 to 8.04); this association was stronger in Blacks (P value of interaction <0.001). Hospital-level rates of AKI exhibited substantial geographic variability, ranging from 10% to 56%. Between March and July 2020, AKI rates declined from 40% to 27%; proportions of AKI stage 3 and AKI requiring KRT decreased from 44% to 17%. Both geographic and temporal variabilities were predominately explained by percentages of Blacks (31% and 49%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common during hospitalization with COVID-19 and associated with higher risk of health care resource utilization and death. Nearly half of patients with AKI did not recover to baseline by discharge. Substantial geographic variation and temporal decline in rates and severity of AKI were observed., PODCAST: This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_11_16_CJN09610620_final.mp3.

{"text": "Current status of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for immune/inflammatory lung disorders: Gleaning insights for possible use in COVID-19. The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials-including for COVID-19-of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

The clinical spectrum of COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is getting wider with the exponential increase of patients worldwide. Initially described with flu-like symptoms, variable cutaneous manifestations have been reported, with only few histopathological descriptions. Detection of the virus in cutaneous samples has been assessed in very few cases until now and the causative role of SARS-CoV-2 has not been proven for every type of cutaneous manifestations yet. We aimed to describe histological features of cutaneous eruptions occurring concomitantly to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess by immunochemistry and in situ hybridization using RNA scope validated technics the presence of the virus in skin lesions. We retrieved all skin biopsies received in the departments of Pathology and Dermatopathology, University Hospital of Strasbourg, performed in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting concomitant cutaneous manifestations since March 2020. In situ hybridization and immunostaining using a polyclonal Sars nucleocapsid protein antibody were performed on each sample. Skin biopsies from six patients presenting morbilliform eruption concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection were available for evaluation. All six samples showed varying degrees of spongiosis, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the dermis, and for some of them, discrete interface dermatitis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were negative in all cutaneous samples. Morbilliform rash concomitant to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by mild and unspecific histopathological features with no detectable viral RNA and protein and appears then not to be directly caused by the virus. Even if, at least for a few cases, the differential diagnosis with drug hypersensitivity reaction can be difficult, these cutaneous eruptions seem to rather correspond to paraviral rashes.

We developed a de novo protein design strategy to swiftly engineer decoys for neutralizing pathogens that exploit extracellular host proteins to infect the cell. Our pipeline allowed the design, validation, and optimization of de novo hACE2 decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The best decoy, CTC-445.2, binds with low nanomolar affinity and high specificity to the RBD of the spike protein. Cryo-EM shows that the design is accurate and can simultaneously bind to all three RBDs of a single spike protein. Because the decoy replicates the spike protein target interface in hACE2, it is intrinsically resilient to viral mutational escape. A bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, shows ~10-fold improvement in binding.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical outcomes of people living with HIV (PWH) coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic., RECENT FINDINGS: Several reports from single centers have described increased, decreased, or no difference in outcomes of COVID-19 in PWH. These studies have come from a range of locations, each with different underlying HIV prevalence and access to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Differences in healthcare quality, access and policies may also affect reported outcomes in PWH across different locations, making interpretation of results more challenging. Meanwhile, different components of ART have been proposed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or disease progression., SUMMARY: The current review considers 6 months of data across geographic regions with a range of healthcare quality and access and ART regimens to generate a wider view of COVID-19 outcomes in PWH. Taken together, these studies indicate that HIV infection may be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, but comorbidities appear to play a larger role than HIV-specific variables in outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH.

{"text": "Multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 applying immunoinformatics and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is severe respiratory illnesses leading to millions of deaths worldwide in very short span. The high case fatality rate and the lack of medical counter measures emphasize for an urgent quest to develop safe and effective vaccine. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on human host cell for the viral attachment and entry, hence considered as a key target to develop vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was employed to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine using RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The potential B- and T-cell epitopes were selected from RBD sequence using various bioinformatics tools to design the vaccine construct. The in silico designed multi-epitope vaccine encompasses 146 amino acids with an adjuvant (human beta-defensin-2), which was further computationally evaluated for several parameters including antigenicity, allergenicity and stability. Subsequently, three-dimensional structure of vaccine construct was modelled and then docked with various toll-like receptors. Molecular dynamics (MD) study of docked TLR3-vaccine complex delineated it to be highly stable during simulation time and the stabilization of interaction was majorly contributed by electrostatic energy. The docked complex also showed low deformation and increased rigidity in motion of residues during dynamics. Furthermore, in silico cloning of the multi-epitope vaccine was carried out to generate the plasmid construct for expression in a bacterial system. Altogether, our study suggests that the designed vaccine candidate containing RBD region could provide the specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

Globally, India has reported the third highest number of COVID-19 cases. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, witnessed a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting in the establishment of isolation facilities named COVID Care Center (CCC). In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health, social and economic tolls. In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid.

Here, we found that neuropilin-1 (NRP1), known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, an effect blocked by a monoclonal blocking antibody against NRP1. A SARS-CoV-2 mutant with an altered furin cleavage site did not depend on NRP1 for infectivity. Pathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected cells including olfactory neuronal cells facing the nasal cavity positive for NRP1.

{"text": "Cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lower in asymptomatic than symptomatic COVID-19 patients. The characterization of cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental to understand COVID-19 progression and the development of immunological memory to the virus. In this study, we detected T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins M, S and N, as well as serum virus-specific IgM, IgA, IgG, in nearly all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but not in healthy donors. Virus-reactive T cells exhibited signs of in vivo activation, as suggested by the surface expression of immune-checkpoint molecules PD1 and TIGIT. Of note, we detected antigen-specific adaptive immune response both in asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. More importantly, symptomatic patients displayed a significantly higher magnitude of both cell-mediated and humoral adaptive immune response to the virus, as compared to asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that an uncontrolled adaptive immune response contribute to the development of the life threatening inflammatory phase of the disease.

Healthcare workers in the regions with higher COVID-19 incidences reported greater PI levels. The main concerns were being infected by COVID-19 or infecting others. Levels of concern correlated with higher PI levels. The protection equipment was generally reported as insufficient, which correlated with higher PI levels. Professionals reporting to overwork during the crisis (60% mass-media, 38% of healthcare and grocery and 21.7% of protective service) showed higher PI levels. In the healthcare group, taking care of patients with COVID-19 (77%) or of dying patients with COVID-19 (43.9%) was associated with higher PI levels.

Background: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. Method(s): Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; >=4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; >=4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. Result(s): The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19., CONTENT: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70-100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1-20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72-94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0-6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates had a positive nasopharyngeal swab; one out of five neonates had elevated concentrations of serum IgM and IgG, but a negative swab., IMPLICATIONS: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated.

{"text": "Review of Cardiac Involvement in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19) is a recently described infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant cardiovascular implications. Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although the prevalence is unknown, there have been more than 300 cases reported in the literature. MIS-C appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the US. MIS-C typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present in vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Empiric treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other immunomodulatory agents have been frequently used. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known.

Therefore, the antimiR-18 roles were summarized in various primate models that aided in developing the therapy for ACE2 related diseases.Copyright \u00a9 2020 [The Author/The Authors]", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Where we missed? Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) epidemiology in Saudi Arabia; 2012-2019. MERS-CoV first case was reported on 23rd November 2012 in Saudi Arabia, Since, then MERS has remained on World Health Organization (WHO) Blueprint list and declared pandemic. This study was conducted on MERS lab confirmed cases reported to Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia and WHO for year 2012-2019. The epidemiology was investigated based on infection rate, death rate, case fatality rate, Gender, Age group, and Medical conditions (Comorbid and Symptomatic). The overall median age of infected male was 58 years and of female was 45 years. While average mortality age in male was 60 years and of female was 65 years which is greater than the global average of 50 years. The results also report that specially after age of 40 years in both men and women, chances of infection are more while comorbidities increase the infection rate. The men are more susceptible to infection than women. In case of asymptomatic distribution trend was vice versa with 69.4% women and 30.6% in men. Second, most infected age group was reduced by 20 years in case of men with 47.37% infection for age group of 20-39 years. This was also observed in age-group of 20-39 years for no comorbid cases (men (50%) & women (79%)). This explains MERS-CoV prevalence in Saudi Arabia, as young and healthy population were infected, and acted as carrier and on coming in contact with vulnerable population (Elderly, chronic and comorbid) transferred the infection. Hence, MERS-CoV outbreak kept on happening from time to time over past years. This finding might very well explain the exponential spread of Novel CoV-19 globally, as initial control measures required older people to stay indoors while younger generation brought infection from outside. Further studies are required for epidemiology analysis based on clusters, travel history and specific disease related mortality.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "COVID 19 mortality: Probable role of microbiome to explain disparity. There is a significant difference between COVID 19 associated mortality between different countries. Generally the number of deaths per million population are higher in the developed countries despite better health care efficiency, drinking water quality and expected healthy life span (HALE) at the time of birth. Developing and underdeveloped countries on the other hand have lower mortality even with higher rural and slum populations along with incidence of diarrhea because of lack of sanitation. We analyzed data from 122 countries out of which 80 were high or upper middle income and 42 were low or low middle income countries. There was statistically significant positive correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and water current score, health efficiency, and HALE. Statistically significant negative correlation was observed with % rural population and fraction of diarrhea because of inadequate sanitation for all ages. Moreover analysis of 51 countries showed that there is significant negative correlation between COVID 19 deaths /million population and proportion of total population living in slums. We propose that high microbial exposure particularly gram negative bacteria can possibly induce interferon type I which might have a protective effect against COVID 19 since the countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases. So, far none of the predictive models have taken into account immune status of populations engendered by environmental microbial exposure or microbiome. There might be a need to look at dynamics of COVID 19 pandemic using immune perspective. The approach can potentially inform better policies including interventions.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Objectives: We explored the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) history on clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV in a designated hospital. Patients were divided into medicine (n = 12) and non-medicine (n = 8) groups according to previous ART history before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Result(s): The median age was 46.5 years and 15 (75%) were female. Ten patients had initial negative RT-PCR on admission, five of which had normal computed tomography (CT) appearance and four were asymptomatic. Lymphocytes were low in nine patients (45%); CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 were low in all patients. The predominant CT features in 19 patients were multiple (42%) ground-glass opacities (58%) and consolidations (32%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was significantly lower in the medicine than the non-medicine group [median (interquartile range, IQR): 14.0 (10.0-34.0) vs 51.0 (35.8-62.0), P = 0.005]. Nineteen patients (95%) were discharged with a median hospital stay of 30 days (IQR 26-30). Conclusion(s): Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection exhibited mild to moderate symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both., OBJECTIVE: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures., DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)., SETTING: Denmark, April and May 2020., PARTICIPANTS: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use., INTERVENTION: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use., MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses., RESULTS: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection., LIMITATION: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others., CONCLUSION: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use.

Six months following the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic in China, data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases are now available. However, the rapid spread of the pandemic has not allowed proper design of prospective studies, thus evidence came mostly from case series and observational studies. The early enthusiasm on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) antiviral properties should not suggest that patients who are longterm treated with antimalarials, such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, a French report on 17 HCQ-treated SLE patients dampened the enthusiasm.1 A recent report from Covid-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance has described 80 SLE patients with Covid-19, mostly females under 65 years of age, 64% of whom were already taking HCQ before the infection: the rate of hospitalisation and the need for intensive care did not differ between patients who were and those who were not taking HCQ.2 A study group from Northern Italy - the Italian epicentre of the pandemic - reported an incidence of 2.5% of Covid-19 (higher compared to the general population of the same region) in 165 patients with SLE.3 Patients with SLE are possibly at risk of developing symptomatic or severe Covid-19, not only because of their disease or treatment but as a consequence of associated comorbidities known to worsen the outcome of SARS-COv-2 infection. 4 5 What do we know so far? SLE patients should not withdraw their medication. Before drawing any other conclusion, large registry data are needed to clarify the incidence and the outcome of Covid-19 in patients with SLE.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "COVID-19 and dentistry: A new challenge. OBJECTIVES A new virus has been identified in China between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. In few months, this coronavirus spread quickly all around the world, leading to an acute respiratory syndrome often asymptomatic but potentially lethal. This new coronavirus, named Sars-CoV-2, belongs to a pathogen family named Corona-viridae and presents a genomic sequence overlapped to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Epidemiological and genetic studies performed on Chinese infected subjects led to the hypothesis that this pandemic originated from a transmission between animal and humans, followed by a contagion between humans. Sars-CoV-2 transmission potential is extremely high and infection pathways are different. This virus appears highly infective through droplets originated by cough, sneeze or exhala-tion of infected patients, but also through direct contact of hands or other body parts with contaminat-ed surfaces. Incubation period seems to vary from three to fourteen days but some cases with a longer incubation period had been reported. Also patients in the incubation phase or asymptomatic subjects are considered potential virus carriers. Since the contagion window seems to be open already in the early phase of infection and seems to include also asymptomatic subjects, the difficulty in restricting the infection transmission is evident. Symptomatic patients mostly present fever, asthenia and dry cough, weather dyspnoea affects more severe subjects. In the worst cases, a severe involvement of respiratory functions leads to hospitalization. Form a clinical point of view, Sars-CoV-2 infection shows a bilateral interstitial pneumonia, radio-graphically evident as a bilateral opacity with no lobar involvement. In this environment, the high in-fection risk of dental professionals is undeniable. MATERIALS AND METHODS This work is a literature review on this topic, since current published articles have been selected and valuable indications are given to the dentist. COVID-19 features, transmission and clinical aspects are given to the reader, as well as prevention and protections aspects in dentistry. CONCLUSIONS Telephonic triage, an accurate an-amnesis and a careful hand hygiene of both patients and operators are considered essential preliminary aspects to be considered. Moreover, big attention has to be placed on antimicrobial agents for personal hygiene effective on coronaviruses and on disinfectant agents for instruments and surfaces. Various methods for environment sanification are reported, through air changing and purification. For the most practical aspects in-stead, expedients suggested are the use of rubber dams, high-speed ejectors and anti-retraction handpieces. Very important is also the selection of the most adequate personal protection devices for airways and ocular protection. Differences between surgical masks and respirators are illustrated, highlighting indications towards Sars-CoV-2. Also indications and information are provided about eye protection devices. These aspects play an important role mostly in this historical period featured by the coronavirus diffusion. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This contribution highlights the risks of coronavirus contamination in dental environments and provides practical indications on preventive and protective systems that can be implemented in daily clinical practice.Copyright \u00a9 2020 EDRA SpA.

Objectives: Patients with rheumatologic diseases might be more susceptible to COVID-19 and carry a poorer prognosis. The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and outcomes of all COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic conditions in Hong Kong. Method(s): This is a population-based retrospective study. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR with a previous diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases were reviewed. The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic conditions was calculated and compared to the general population in Hong Kong. Descriptive data of those rheumatologic patients with COVID-19 and the clinical course of the index infection were presented. Result(s): Up till 27 May 2020, there were 1067 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Hong Kong which had a population of 7.5 million. Out of the 39,835 patients with underlying rheumatologic diseases, we identified 5 PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. The estimated incidence of COVID-19 was 0.0126% patients with rheumatologic diseases, compared to 0.0142% in the general population. All 5 patients had inflammatory arthropathies. One patient was on hydroxychloroquine and sulphasalazine, and one was on methotrexate. None of the 3534 patients on b/tsDMARDs was infected.

Objectives To evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients presented with acute self-poisoning at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. Methods and Patients A comparative study was conducted at Lady Reading Hospital MTI between May 2018 to May 2019 for a duration of 12 months. All patients diagnosed with acute self-poisoning were included in the study. Patients with inconclusive diagnosis, who were dead prior to the arrival to the hospital, or had an incomplete history of poison exposure were excluded from the study. At the time of arrival to the emergency department, the patient was first stabilized. Patients were grouped into two according to the type of exposure, i.e., accidental self-poisoning and deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded in a preformed proforma. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The mortality rate in patients with accidental poisoning was 9.62%, whereas it was 26.28% in DSP patients. Data were stratified according to the mode of poisoning, i.e., accidental vs DSP, and variables were assessed in patients who did not survive. It was found that 60% of patients who died in the accidental group were aged 0-15 years. In contrast, only one patient between aged 0-15 years died in the DSP group and the majority of the deaths occurred in those aged 25.1-35 years (31 [75.6%]).

BACKGROUND: Antibody diagnostics play an important role in disease detection and can potentially aid in monitoring of the immune responses to see if an individual has developed immunity. Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2., METHODS: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw., RESULTS: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 99.67% and 99.77%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS (Dried Blood Spot) matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection., CONCLUSION: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

As of October 2020 management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on supportive care and off-label or compassionate-use therapies. On March 2020 tocilizumab - an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody - was suggested as immunomodulatory treatment in severe COVID-19 because hyperinflammatory syndrome occurs in many patients similarly to the cytokine release syndrome that develops after CAR-T cell therapy. In our retrospective observational study, 20 severe COVID-19 patients were treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard-of-care therapy (SOC) and compared with 13 COVID-19 patients receiving only SOC. Clinical respiratory status, inflammatory markers and vascular radiologic score improved after one week from tocilizumab administration. On the contrary these parameters were stable or worsened in patients receiving only SOC. Despite major study limitations, improvement of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient as well as vascular radiologic score after one week may account for improved pulmonary vascular perfusion and could explain the more rapid recovery of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab compared to controls.

The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat. Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics. To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol). In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV. As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We here present results from 60-day follow up of our cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of ELISA anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recently FDA-required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma.

BACKGROUND: Due to coronavirus pandemic, governments have ordered a nationwide isolation. In this situation, we hypothesised that people holding conspiracy beliefs are less willing to adhere to medical guidelines. Furthermore, we explored what possible factors may modify relationships between conspiracy, paranoia-like beliefs, and adherence to epidemiological guidelines. Also, we examined the prevalence of different coronavirus conspiracy beliefs., METHODS: Two independent internet studies. Study 1 used a proportional quota sample that was representative of the population of Poles in terms of gender and settlement size (n=507). Study 2 employed a convenience sample (n=840)., RESULTS: Coronavirus conspiracy beliefs are negatively related to safety guidelines. Mixed results suggest that paranoia-like beliefs are related negatively to safety guidelines. Prevalence of firmly held coronavirus conspiracy beliefs is rare. Nevertheless, certain percentage of participants agree with conspiracy beliefs at least partially. Coronavirus related anxiety, trust in media, and internal motivation to isolation moderate the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and adherence to safety guidelines. Paranoia-like beliefs partially mediate between boredom and conspiracy beliefs., CONCLUSIONS: Conspiracy beliefs concerning coronavirus are present in the population and are negatively related to adherence to safety guidelines. Conspiracy beliefs originate partially from boredom and paranoia proneness. Certain factors - trust in media and internal motivation to isolation - are potentially worthwhile to address to enhance adherence to safety guidelines.

Compared with individuals ages 54 years or younger, the incident rate ratio (IRR) was 8.1, indicating that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 8.1 times higher (95%CI = 7.7, 8.5) among those 55 to 64 years, and more than 62 times higher (IRR = 62.1; 95%CI = 59.7, 64.7) among those ages 65 or older. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were 77% higher in men than in women (IRR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.74, 1.79)., CONCLUSIONS: In the 16 countries examined, persons age 65 years or older had strikingly higher COVID-19 mortality rates compared to younger individuals, and men had a higher risk of COVID-19 death than women.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Back to basics: review on vitamin D and respiratory viral infections including COVID-19. Importance: As the scientific community is in a marathon in finding out the cure for COVID-19, in this crisis, it is essential for the physicians not to forget about the basics. Due to the pandemic crisis, in many nursing homes and hospitals, there established new policies on decreasing unnecessary medications to minimize cross-contamination. Sometimes these policies are making providers avoid essential drugs such as Vitamins, including Vitamin D. In this paper, we try to emphasize the importance of Vitamin D in COVID-19 and respiratory viral patients., Relevance: Vitamin D helps in decreasing the 'pro-inflammatory cytokines' in the lungs and acts in immunomodulatory function, and 'also it will increase the anti-inflammatory, antiviral responses of the respiratory epithelial cells during infection.', Conclusion: Due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and the increased morbidity and mortality with no appropriate therapy and vaccine, one must be cautious and do everything to help COVID-19 patients. In hospitals and other health care settings to decrease cross-contamination, holding other non-essential medications is taking place. Discontinuing Vitamins could increase the mortality and morbidity of those affected, especially in deficient/insufficient individuals. Obtaining serum 25 (OH) D levels in all patients with viral respiratory infections, especially COVID-19, could help in the detection and treatment of Vitamin D deficiency and potentially decrease recovery time and improve outcome. Even though evidence suggests that vitamin D has the anti-inflammatory, antiviral properties, randomized double-blinded controlled trials are needed to verify this further, and to understand Vitamin D and COVID-19 better., Abbreviations: Vitamin D receptor-VDR; 25(OH)D- 25 hydroxyvitamin D; 1,25 (OH)D-1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D; 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D-1,25[OH]2 D or calcitriol; IU- International Units; Interferons stimulated genes- ISG; ARI- acute respiratory infection; RSV- respiratory syncytial virus; RTI- Respiratory tract infections; COPD-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; BMI-Basal metabolic index; USA-USA.

Seven months with COVID19 pandemic, the prevalence passes twenty million and the deaths have reached more than three quarter of million worldwide. The pandemic began in Wuhan, China in January 2020, then transferred vigorously to Europe and the USA. Failure of the conventional therapies in the treatment of severe illness of COVID19 patients and lack of a specific vaccine or therapies target for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the drug repositioning in treatment of COVID19 patients is the only opportunity to face this pandemic. It is reported that the cytokine storm is the main reason for severe illness and high mortality. Thus, we discuss the implication of immunotherapies in combination with micronutrients (Zinc, Selenium, and vitamin C) and antioxidants such as Glutathione (cysteine pro-drug) in counteracting SARS-CoV2-induced cytokine storm as a possible insight to improve the clinical outcomes. The present review highlights the importance to widen the scale of researches on immunotherapies in combination with micronutrients to involve different doses, route of administration, molecular targets, and different populations worldwide. Particularly, polymorphisms are attributed to the noticed variations in the risk factors to COVID19 as well as the response to therapies. Thus, global studies about applications of different immunotherapies plus micronutrients are recommended to establish different regimens in the treatment of different populations. Also, we need to study the mode of actions of the immunotherapies beyond their immunosuppression role. Finally, global cooperation in either innovation or repositioning therapies is warranted since the response to therapies differs among the population.Copyright \u00a9 2020 International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Phytopharmacological Research.

{"text": "Fluid dynamics simulations show that facial masks can suppress the spread of COVID-19 in indoor environments. The Coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 has been causing significant loss of life and unprecedented economical loss throughout the world. Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Purpose: To summarize the clinical features and effective therapy of severe COVID-19 patients., Patients and Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, from January 21, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed., Results: Of the 350 COVID-19 patients, 13.7% were severe cases. On admission, compared with non-severe patients, more severe patients had a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 3 (58.3% vs 33.8%, P=0.001), D-dimer > 1 mg/L (41.7% vs 13.6%, P<0.0001), higher level of CRP (39.1 mg/L, IQR18.1-75.9 vs 13.4 mg/L, IQR5.0-32.8, P<0.0001), and multiple pneumonia on CT (77.1% vs 18.2%, P<0.0001). All severe patients received oxygen support. 95.8% of them received antivirals, and the most frequent therapy was lopinavir and ritonavir plus human interferon-alpha2b. Moxifloxacin was used in 70.8% severe patients. The total dosage of methylprednisolone sodium succinate was 640 mg (IQR 360-960) in severe patients, and the duration of use was 8.5 days (IQR 6.8-11.3). The total dosage of immunoglobulin was 80 g (IQR, 60-140) in severe patients, and the duration was 8.0 days (IQR, 6.0-11.5). As of March 15, 2020, 95.8% of the severe patients had been discharged and only two deaths occurred., Conclusion: The rate of severe cases and mortality of COVID-19 in Hunan are lower than those in Wuhan. In addition to antivirals and oxygen support, timely interventions including corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, contribute to improving the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.

{"text": "Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review. Background: In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. Search Method(s): We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection Criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data Collection and Analysis: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. Main Result(s): We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19. Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travelEleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantineEvidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellersEvidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

COVID toes were one symptom experienced as a part of her illness. Because COVID toes are usually seen in the recovery phase of COVID-19, and often in patients with less severe cases, many providers are unfamiliar with this new symptom., CONCLUSION: Familiarity with COVID toes will help foot care providers to identify patients who may not have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but could still be infectious and need to be isolated.

{"text": "Polymer microarrays rapidly identify competitive adsorbents of virus-like particles. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the global need for platform technologies to enable the rapid development of diagnostics, vaccines, treatments, and personal protective equipment (PPE). However, many current technologies require the detailed mechanistic knowledge of specific material-virion interactions before they can be employed, for example, to aid in the purification of vaccine components or in the design of a more effective PPE. Here, we show that an adaption of a polymer microarray method for screening bacterial-surface interactions allows for the screening of polymers for desirable material-virion interactions. Nonpathogenic virus-like particles including fluorophores are exposed to the arrays in an aqueous buffer as a simple model of virions carried to the surface in saliva/sputum. Competitive binding of Lassa and Rubella virus-like particles is measured to probe the relative binding properties of a selection of copolymers. This provides the first step in the development of a method for the discovery of novel materials with promise for viral binding, with the next being development of this method to assess absolute viral adsorption and assessment of the attenuation of the activity of live virus, which we propose would be part of a material scale up step carried out in high containment facilities, alongside the use of more complex media to represent biological fluids.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Prevalence of readily detected amyloid blood clots in 'unclotted' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 plasma: a preliminary report. BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a well-known comorbidity to COVID-19 and coagulopathies are a common accompaniment to both T2DM and COVID-19. In addition, patients with COVID-19 are known to develop micro-clots within the lungs. The rapid detection of COVID-19 uses genotypic testing for the presence of SARS-Cov-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs, but it can have a poor sensitivity. A rapid, host-based physiological test that indicated clotting severity and the extent of clotting pathologies in the individual who was infected or not would be highly desirable., METHODS: Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was collected and frozen. On the day of analysis, PPP samples were thawed and analysed. We show here that microclots can be detected in the native plasma of twenty COVID-19, as well as ten T2DM patients, without the addition of any clotting agent, and in particular that such clots are amyloid in nature as judged by a standard fluorogenic stain. Results were compared to ten healthy age-matched individuals., RESULTS: In COVID-19 plasma these microclots are significantly increased when compared to the levels in T2DM., CONCLUSIONS: This fluorogenic test may provide a rapid and convenient test with 100% sensitivity (P < 0.0001) and is consistent with the recognition that the early detection and prevention of such clotting can have an important role in therapy.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: We have previously developed a test for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on the detection of the SARS-coronavirus RNA in serum by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of automating the serum RNA extraction procedure in order to increase the throughput of the assay. Method(s): An automated nucleic acid extraction platform using the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. We developed a modified protocol in compliance with the recommended biosafety guidelines from the World Health Organization based on the use of the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit for the extraction of SARS-coronavirus RNA. The modified protocol was compared with a column-based extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) for quantitative performance, analytical sensitivity and precision. Result(s): The newly developed automated protocol was shown to be free from carry-over contamination and have comparable performance with other standard protocols and kits designed for the MagNA Pure LC instrument. However, the automated method was found to be less sensitive, less precise and led to consistently lower serum SARS-coronavirus concentrations when compared with the column-based extraction method. Conclusion(s): As the diagnostic efficiency and prognostic value of the serum SARS-CoV RNA RT-PCR test is critically associated with the analytical sensitivity and quantitative performance contributed both by the RNA extraction and RT-PCR components of the test, we recommend the use of the column-based manual RNA extraction method. \u00a9 2006 Chiu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "From infections to autoimmunity: Diagnostic challenges in common variable immunodeficiency. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common clinically significant primary antibody deficiency diagnosed in adults. The early symptoms are not specific. They include common infections, mainly of the respiratory tract, caused by typical microorganisms, so cases can be missed in primary care. In the majority of patients increased susceptibility to infections coexists with signs or symptoms of autoimmunity, inflammation or polyclonal lymphoproliferation, which can divert diagnosis from immune deficiency. The overall incidence of malignancy is increased in CVID and certain cancers are significantly more common. Lymphomas and gastric carcinoma are the most frequently reported malignancies in CVID, so a high index of suspicion is recommended. Diagnostic delay in CVID is seen worldwide. The main goal of this paper is to increase the awareness about CVID among health care professionals. We aim to present features which can be helpful in CVID diagnosis in order to shorten the \"latency\" of proper management of CVID patients. We review clinical symptoms, complications and laboratory abnormalities of CVID. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is regarded as the cornerstone of pharmacological intervention. New modes of Ig application, mainly subcutaneously and via the hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous route, help to adjust therapy to patients' needs and preferences. Still there remain unmet needs. It remains to be seen whether CVID complications can be avoided by earlier diagnosis, treatment and thorough monitoring in the context of increased risk of malignancy. Development of patient tailored protocols depending on the clinical phenotype and risk factors might be more appropriate. The most important consideration is to diagnose suspected cases and stratify patients in a precise and timely way.

{"text": "Do Paramedics Have a Professional Obligation to Work During a Pandemic? A Qualitative Exploration of Community Member Expectations. OBJECTIVES: Previous research has identified a lack of clarification regarding paramedic professional obligation to work. Understanding community expectations of paramedics will provide some clarity around this issue. The objective of this research was to explore the expectations of a sample of Australian community members regarding the professional obligation of paramedics to respond during pandemics. METHOD(S): The authors used qualitative methods to gather Australian community member perspectives immediately before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Focus groups were used for data collection, and a thematic analysis was conducted. RESULT(S): The findings revealed 9 key themes: context of obligation (normal operations versus crisis situation), hierarchy of obligation (individual versus organizational obligation), risk acceptability, acceptable occupational risk (it's part of the job), access to personal protective equipment, legal and ethical guidelines, education and training, safety, and acceptable limitations to obligation. The factors identified as being acceptable limitations to professional obligation are presented as further sub-themes: physical health, mental health, and competing personal obligations. CONCLUSION(S): The issue of professional obligation must be addressed by ambulance services as a matter of urgency, especially in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Further research is recommended to understand how community member expectations evolve during and after the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Importance: Local variation in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the United States has not been well studied. Objective(s): To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study included 211 counties, representing state capitals and cities with at least 100000 residents and including 178892208 US residents, in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020, and April 23, 2020. Exposures: Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data. Result(s): The 211 counties contained 178892208 of 326289971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) degreeC. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) Rtin the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in Rt(95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative Rtat 0 degreeC of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative Rtdecreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 degreeC, increased between 11 and 20 degreeC (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 degreeC. With a 70% reduction in visits to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7%) were estimated to fall below a threshold Rtof 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties (81.0%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1%) in the lowest density quartile.2Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather were associated with a decreased Rtfor SARS-CoV-2 in counties across the United States.

Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19, and explore the risk factors of deterioration and death of the disease. Method(s): In this retrospective study, we collected data from 121 COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2019, to March 23, 2020, and conducted statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 121 patients were included in our study, the median age was 65 years (IQR, 55.0-71.5 years), and 54.5% cases were men. Among those cases, 52 (43.0%) cases progressed to severe, and 14 (11.6%) died. Overall, the most common manifestations were fever (78.5%) and respiratory symptoms (77.7%), while neurological symptoms were found in only 9.9% of the patients. 70.2% of all the cases had comorbidities, including hypertension (40.5%) and diabetes (20.7%). On admission, cases usually show elevated levels of neutrophils (27.3%), D-dimer (72.6%), Interleukin-6 (35.2%), Interleukin-10 (64.4%), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (82.6%), and lactate dehydrogenase (62.0%), and decreased levels of lymphocytes (66.9%), CD3 cells (67.2%), and CD4 cells (63.0%). The proportional hazard Cox models showed that the risk factors for severity progression and death included comorbidities (HR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.78-11.55 and HR: 7.81, 95% CI: 1.02-59.86), leukocytosis (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05-1.22 and HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10-1.42), neutrophilia (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.13 and HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13-1.46, and elevated LDH (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.12-1.15 and HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.10-1.12). Elevated D-dimer (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), IL-6 (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02) and IL-10 levels (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07) were also risk factors for the progression of disease severity. Meanwhile, lymphopenia and wake immune responses [e.g., lower CD3, CD4, or CD19 counts (all HR < 1)] were associated with disease deterioration and death. Conclusion(s): Severe cases and death of COVID-19 are associated with older age, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, lymphopenia, high cytokines, and weak immune responses.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Zou, Dai, Zhang, Fu, Gao, Zhang and Zhang.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: The management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new human virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is challenging. Recently, there have been several reports with inconsistent results after treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) on critically ill patients with COVID-19, which was produced with a neutralizing antibody titer and tested in a P3 or P4 laboratory. However, due to the limitation of the conditions on mass production of plasma, most producers hardly had the capability to isolate the neutralizing antibody. Here, we report the clinical courses of three critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving CP treatments by total immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer collection. Method(s): Three patients with COVID-19 in this study were laboratory confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, with radiographic and clinical features of pneumonia. CP was collected by total IgG titer of 160 (range, 200-225 mL), and patients were transfused between 20 and 30 days after disease onset at the critical illness stage as a trial in addition to standard care. The clinical courses of these patients, including laboratory results and pulmonary functional and image studies after receiving convalescent plasma infusions, were reviewed. Result(s): No therapeutic effect of CP was observed in any of the patients; instead, all three patients deteriorated and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. A potential cytokine storm 4 hours after infusion of CP in Patient 2 was observed. No more patients were put on the trial of CP transfusion. Conclusion(s): We recommend extreme caution in using CP in critically ill patients more than 2 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia.Copyright \u00a9 2020 AABB", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Given the relatively low rate and limited publicly available data regarding children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, this knowledge gap should be addressed with urgency. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the epidemiological spectrum and clinical characteristics of children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Relevant international and Chinese public databases were systematically searched to identify all case studies from January 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020. This study consisted of 96 studies involving 7004 cases. The mean age of pediatric cases was 6.48 years (95% CI 52.0-77.5), 90% had household contact, and 66% presented with mild to moderate clinical syndromes. The main symptoms were fever (47%, 95% CI 41-53%) and cough (42%, 95% CI 36-48%). About 23% of children were asymptomatic, 27% had comorbidity, and 29% had a co-infection. The pooled mean incubation period was 9.57 days (95% CI 7.70-11.44). The shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract lasted 11.43 days, and 75% of patients had virus particles in their stool. A total of 34% of the children had neutropenia and 26% had lymphocytosis. Interferon-alpha (81%) was the most commonly used antiviral drug in the children. The discharge and death rates were 79 and 1%. In conclusion, the transmissibility of pediatric COVID-19 should be not ignored because of the relatively long incubation period, shedding duration, and mild clinical syndromes.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Li, Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Wang and Zhu.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

In this review, we summarize the literature on light-based (UV, blue, and red lights) sanitization methods for the inactivation of ssRNA viruses in different matrixes (air, liquid, and solid). The rate of inactivation of ssRNA viruses in liquid was higher than in air, whereas inactivation on solid surfaces varied with the type of surface. The efficacy of light-based inactivation was reduced by the presence of absorptive materials. Several technologies can be used to deliver light, including mercury lamp (conventional UV), excimer lamp (UV), pulsed-light, and light-emitting diode (LED). Pulsed-light technologies could inactivate viruses more quickly than conventional UV-C lamps. Large-scale use of germicidal LED is dependent on future improvements in their energy efficiency. Blue light possesses virucidal potential in the presence of exogenous photosensitizers, although femtosecond laser (ultrashort pulses) can be used to circumvent the need for photosensitizers. Red light can be combined with methylene blue for application in medical settings, especially for sanitization of blood products. Future modelling studies are required to establish clearer parameters for assessing susceptibility of viruses to light-based inactivation. There is considerable scope for improvement in the current germicidal light-based technologies and practices.Copyright \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global health emergency, and the presence of Furin site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein alters virulence and warrants further molecular, structural, and biophysical studies. Here we report the structure of Furin in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, demonstrating how Furin binds to the S1/S2 region of spike glycoprotein and eventually cleaves the viral protein using experimental functional studies, molecular dynamics, and docking. The structural studies underline the mechanism and mode of action of Furin, which is a key process in host cell entry and a hallmark of enhanced virulence. Our whole-exome sequencing analysis shows the genetic variants/alleles in Furin were found to alter the binding affinity for viral spike glycoprotein and could vary in infectivity in humans.

{"text": "Purified, soluble recombinant mouse hepatitis virus receptor, Bgp1b, and Bgp2 murine coronavirus receptors differ in mouse hepatitis virus binding and neutralizing activities. Mouse hepatitis virus receptor (MHVR) is a murine biliary glycoprotein (Bgp1a). Purified, soluble MHVR expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus neutralized the infectivity of the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV- A59) in a concentration-dependent manner. Several anchored murine Bgps in addition to MHVR can also function as MHV-A59 receptors when expressed at high levels in nonmurine cells. To investigate the interactions of these alternative MHVR glycoproteins with MHV, we expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity the extracellular domains of several murine Bgps as soluble, six-histidine-tagged glycoproteins, using a baculovirus expression system. These include MHVR isoforms containing four or two extracellular domains and the corresponding Bgp1b glycoproteins from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, as well as Bgp2 and truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1b comprised of the first two immunoglobulin-like domains. The soluble four-domain MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR[1-4]) had fourfold more MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding soluble Bgp1b (sBgp1b) glycoprotein and at least 1,000-fold more neutralizing activity than sBgp2. Although virus binds to the N-terminal domain (domain 1), soluble truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1b containing only domains 1 and 2 bound virus poorly and had 10- and 300-fold less MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding four-domain glycoproteins. In contrast, the soluble MHVR glycoprotein containing domains 1 and 4 (sMHVR[1,4]) had as much neutralizing activity as the four-domain glycoprotein, sMHVR[1-4]. Thus, the virus neutralizing activity of MHVR domain 1 appears to be enhanced by domain 4. The sBgp1b[1-4] glycoprotein had 500-fold less neutralizing activity for MHV-JHM than for MHV-A59. Thus, MHV strains with differences in S-glycoprotein sequence, tissue tropism, and virulence can differ in the ability to utilize the various murine Bgps as receptors.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "103 Impact of Stay-at-Home Orders on Reported Pediatric Poisonings during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Study Objectives: Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the illness \"COVID-19,\" was announced by China in December 2019. Soon after, a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania (PA) were first announced on March 6, 2020. Subsequently, there were limitations of gatherings and travel, closure of schools and non-essential businesses and physical distancing. With limitations, children were at home for longer periods of time and subsequently had increased access to potentially poisonous substances, such as over the counter medications, prescriptions, medications that are only delivered in a clinic but were given for home use due to closures, and increased amounts of cleaning supplies. The inherent isolation that comes with physical distancing was feared to surge depression and suicidal gestures particularly among adolescents. We know from previous natural disasters that an increase in reported exposures to poison control centers follow a major incident. We anticipated an increase in reported pediatric exposures to the Poison Control Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP PCC) and nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): We analyzed all reported pediatric cases (less than 18 years old) in the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS) and the CHOP PCC of eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. Timeframes analyzed included January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, which were compared to the same timeframes in 2018 and 2019. The data was then characterized by total reported cases per month, and subsequently by age groups of zero to five years, six to twelve years, and thirteen to eighteen years. Out of the separated groups, we evaluated sex, site of reported case, unintentional or intentional ingestion, and reported outcomes. Result(s): The number of reported pediatric poisonings did not vary significantly when comparing each month of 2020 to the previous two years. Sex, intent, and medical outcomes did not vary significantly from year to year or following the implementation of the stay-at-home order.The greatest increase observed was among the age group six to twelve years with site listed as \"own residence,\" or the percentage of reports coming from a home, when comparing the months of March through May in the year 2019 to 2020 on both the local level (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.8-2.6, P<0.0001) and the national level (OR 2.15; 95% CI 2.08-2.23, P<0.0001). This reflects a statistically significant increase in poisonings occurring in the home during a pandemic when compared to the same time in the year previous. Conclusion(s): Following the implementation of stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, total volume of pediatric poisonings reported to both the CHOP PCC and nationally did not increase when compared to previous years. However, the number of exposures listed as occurring in \"own residence\" increased significantly from March through May 2020 when compared to the year prior, particularly in the age group six to twelve years. This is important for emergency physicians to be aware of as many predictions call for \"a second wave,\" as with the usual course of other coronaviruses. Additional stay-at-home orders to help mitigate spread of the virus may occur, along with an increase in school-aged children with reported poisonings.Copyright \u00a9 2020", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Prognostic tools are required to guide clinical decision-making in COVID-19. Method(s): We studied the relationship between the ratio of interleukin (IL)-6 to IL-10 and clinical outcome in 80 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and created a simple 5-point linear score predictor of clinical outcome, the Dublin-Boston score. Clinical outcome was analysed as a three-level ordinal variable (\"Improved\", \"Unchanged\", or \"Declined\"). For both IL-6:IL-10 ratio and IL-6 alone, we associated clinical outcome with a) baseline biomarker levels, b) change in biomarker level from day 0 to day 2, c) change in biomarker from day 0 to day 4, and d) slope of biomarker change throughout the study. The associations between ordinal clinical outcome and each of the different predictors were performed with proportional odds logistic regression. Associations were run both \"unadjusted\" and adjusted for age and sex. Nested cross-validation was used to identify the model for incorporation into the Dublin-Boston score. Finding(s): The 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 ratio was chosen to derive the Dublin-Boston score. Each 1 point increase in the score was associated with a 5.6 times increased odds for a more severe outcome (OR 5.62, 95% CI -3.22-9.81, P = 1.2 x 10-9). Both the Dublin-Boston score and the 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 significantly outperformed IL-6 alone in predicting clinical outcome at day 7. Interpretation(s): The Dublin-Boston score is easily calculated and can be applied to a spectrum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. More informed prognosis could help determine when to escalate care, institute or remove mechanical ventilation, or drive considerations for therapies.

{"text": "A Novel Protocol for Very Early Hospital Discharge After STEMI. Although the incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is on the decline, management of patients who present with STEMI continues to require significant health care resources. Earlier hospital discharge in low-risk patients who present with STEMI has been an area of focus in an attempt to reduce health care costs. As a result, discharge within 48-72 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention has increasingly become routine practice. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous pressure on health care systems to find ways to increase bed capacity, preserve resources, and reduce the risk of exposure to patients and health care workers. In response to this goal, the Ottawa Heart Institute has developed and implemented a novel Very Early Hospital Discharge (VEHD) protocol. The VEHD protocol is a simple, 4-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk STEMI patients who can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention. When deemed eligible for VEHD predischarge tasks are completed by the treating medical and nursing team and the patient is discharged home. Follow-up is completed remotely via virtual care (48 hours, 7 days, 30 days), and in the outpatient cardiology clinic (4-6 weeks). Amid a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we believe the VEHD protocol is a crucial step in maintaining exceptional quality of care, in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, while concurrently decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections, and reducing resource utilization.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Implications for border containment strategies when COVID-19 presents atypically. Objectives: For a large part of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore had managed to keep local cases in the single digits daily, with decisive measures. Yet, we saw this critical time point when the imported cases surged through our borders. The gaps which we can and have efficiently closed, using a public health approach and global border containment strategies, are aptly illustrated through this case. This critical point of imported case surge has resulted in a large spike of daily local cases sustained through community transmission, up to 120/day within a very short time frame. We were able to rapidly bring this under control. Study design: This is a case study of a patient who passed through our borders, with COVID-19 masquerading as a resolved sore throat. Method(s): The events were prospectively documented. Result(s): We present a case of a 21-year-old student returning from Nottingham. He presented with sore throat as the only symptom the few days prior his return, and on arrival at our border (day 7 from initial symptoms), his sore throat had already resolved. The events leading up to his COVID-19 diagnosis highlight the gaps of the international screening processes at the global border entry and the potential consequences of community chain transmission through imported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion(s): An important global border control measure to implement quickly will be to expand the symptom list to isolated sore throat and/or a prior history of recent symptoms (resolved). This may capture a larger proportion of imported cases at border entry point for more effective containment.

Background: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been controlled, the subsequently emerging sporadic cases in 2004 emphasize the necessity of developing a rapid diagnostic method, which would be of great help in clinical diagosis and also wild host screening. This study aims to establish an effective and rapid serological tool for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV by comparison among whole viral, N and N 199 proteins by ELISA. Method(s): SARS-CoV N and N199 (a truncated nucleocapsid gene) genes were cloned, expressed, identified by Western blotting, and applied in screening of human and swine samples. Sera of SARS convalescent-phase patients, normal human sera, sera of patients with other respiratory diseases, and swine sera were screened by ELISA, with whole SARS-CoV F69, N and N199 proteins as antigens. Result(s): The sensitivity and specificity of N and N199 proteins in human sera diagnosis were approximate (P=0.743), which was higher than whole viral protein but the difference was not significant (P=0.234). The N199 protein proved to be more specific in swine sera screening than whole viral and N protein (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): N199 protein is feasible in both clinical diagnosis and SARS-CoV reservoir screening.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in pediatric patients are mild or asymptomatic. However, infants have emerged at higher risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes in pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case series of 4 full-term neonates hospitalized with fever and found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection with a spectrum of illness severities. Two neonates required admission to the intensive care unit for respiratory insufficiency and end organ involvement. Half of the patients were found to have a coinfection.

{"text": "Dual Substance Use of Electronic Cigarettes and Alcohol. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are a modern nicotine delivery system that rapidly grew in widespread use, particularly in younger populations. Given the long history of the comorbidity of alcohol and nicotine use, the rising prevalence of ECs raises the question as to their role in the consumption of alcohol. Of the numerous models of ECs available, JUUL is the most popular. This narrative review aims to determine current trends in literature regarding the relationship between EC and alcohol dual use, as well as hypothesize potential pathogenic tissue damage and summarize areas for future study, including second-hand vapor exposure and calling for standardization among studies. In summary, EC users are more likely to participate in hazardous drinking and are at higher risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We surmise the pathogenic damage of dual use may exhibit an additive effect, particularly in pathogen clearance from the lungs, increased inflammation and decreased immune response, physical damage to epithelial cells, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-like illnesses. A better understanding of pathogenic damages is critical to understand the risks placed on dual users when exposed to respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wetzel and Wyatt.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Psychological Impact During the First Outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy. The first outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy was confirmed on February 21, 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 turned into a global pandemic, causing a global health emergency, triggering an unprecedented event in the modern era. This study assessed the immediate psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on emotional health and well-being. An ad hoc questionnaire was designed for online completion to expedite data collection during the COVID-19 outbreak. People were invited to participate in the study via social media and email from 4 to 18 March 2020. The entire survey comprised of 21 questions, covering a wide range of factors, such as demographics, disease knowledge, psychological impact, daily life activities, and psychological precautionary measures. The main outcome measure was psychological impact. This was measured based on intensity and prevalence of self-reported feelings of anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, and concern during the epidemic. In total, 10,025 respondents completed the online survey. Of these, about 73% were females, and 100% of the sample possessed good knowledge of the disease. The greatest prevalence of high psychological impact was reported in the <34 years' age group and in north Italy. Additionally, the psychological impact influenced important daily life activities, such as sexuality and nutrition. Our study provides information about the immediate psychological (emotional feelings) responses of Italy's general population to the COVID-19 epidemic. The survey covers several factors that can influence mental health; our results help gauge the psychological burden on the community and offer ways to minimize the impact.\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2020 Ferrucci, Averna, Marino, Reitano, Ruggiero, Mameli, Dini, Poletti, Barbieri, Priori and Pravettoni.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Analysis of humoral immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has caused a pandemic with tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. Here, the humoral immune response of a cohort of 143 COVID-19 patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany was characterized. METHOD(S): SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULT(S): COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. CONCLUSION(S): The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

{"text": "End-point RT-PCR: A potential alternative for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the \"gold standard\" for the direct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/muL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 muL final volume. Finally, considering specificity, analytical sensitivity and cost reduction, we believe that the RT-PCR platform described here may be a viable option for the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections in laboratories in which RT-qPCR is not available.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Telemedicine clinic for renal transplant patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been a huge challenge for health care systems with an estimated mortality rate of 1.4%. Elderly population, oncology and immunocompromised patients are at high risks with variable severity of the disease. As the data regarding COVID-19 in transplant population is emerging and new insight need to directed toward reducing the risks and embracing new health care services and standards. Sharing such experience is fundamental for other health care systems to learn, adapt and innovate during this medically demanding period. We would like to shed a light on telemedicine service and innovative ways in dealing with renal transplant recipients in a tertiary hospital in United Arab Emirates. Method(s): We descripted our experience in dealing with outpatient services provided for renal transplant recipients during COVID-19 pandemic (Tawam Hospital, AlAin, UAE). The transition from clinic visit to telemedicine clinics, home delivery of medications and reducing risks of COVID-19 infection among such vulnerable patients. Result(s): More than 200 renal transplant recipients are following up regularly in our outpatient nephrology clinics. As the number of COVID-19 infected cases is increasing in UAE, rigorous measures at local, society and international levels have been implemented to contain and overcome this pandemic. Telemedicine clinics was considered a reasonable choice to reduce the follow of the renal transplant patients to hospital where they can acquire the infection. Scheduling of the patients, sending reminders, phone communication with nephrology consultant, laboratory orders and documentation on electronic health record were allocated. Medications prescribed was delivered to the patients' home free of charge and some patients might be eligible for refill medications over 3 months. Renal transplant patients with abnormal laboratory results and/ or symptoms of respiratory infections that required medical attention will be directed to clinic or emergency visit. Pretransplantation workups were not performed. With national regulation of 'Stay At Home' Initiative, renal transplant recipients were instructed to limit exposure with other people, avoid unnecessary out home activities and some were provided medical report to perform work at home. Hand hygiene, universal mask wearing, avoidance of sick patients along with infection control measures are essential. Through humanitarian UAE efforts: personal care supplies are provided for needy patients. Patients who came from outside UAE, they required to stay at home if asymptomatic for 2 weeks with repeated COVID- 19 screening per protocol. Several hospital polices and clinical pathways were considered. Medical personnel were at front line to accommodate and embrace such changes with continues monitoring. Conclusion(s): Medical innovations and telemedicine has positive impact on health care provided for renal transplant recipient during COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting high standard health practices along with other infection control measures resulted in less COVID-19 infected renal transplant cases.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "104 Associations between Neighborhood Disadvantage Measures and COVID-19 Case Clusters. Study Objectives: The spatial distribution of COVID-19 remains to be described, though there is growing evidence of an increased burden among already disadvantaged populations and neighborhoods. Understanding the pattern of population risk is critically important for health systems and policy makers responding to the pandemic. Our aims were: 1) to describe the association between neighborhood factors and incident cases of COVID-19; and 2) to examine the changes in cases over time. We hypothesized that there would be an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and case clusters. Method(s): We analyzed data from patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston, MA from 2/5/20 to 5/4/20. Patient mailing addresses were geocoded to census tracts within a 20-mile radius of Boston. COVID-19 incidence per census tract was calculated using Empirical Bayes smoothed rates to adjust for small area estimation. Clustering of cases at the census tract level were assessed using local Moran's I, accounting for multiple comparisons. Quantile local spatial autocorrelation was used to determine the spatial association between neighborhood demographic and disadvantage measures (from the American Community Survey) and census tracts with high incidence of COVID-19. Poisson regression models were used to assess the independent associations between neighborhood factors and COVID-19. Finally, we mapped the distribution of cases in the study area over time. Result(s): As of May 4, 2020, there were 9,898 patients in the study area who had been treated in the health care system for COVID-19. The overall crude incidence was 31.8 cases per 10,000 population; adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2.3 to 405.1 per 10,000 population. Two case clusters were identified in the Chelsea/Everett and Lynn areas (p=0.007). We found statistically significant co-location of the top quintile of cases with several neighborhood factors (all p<0.05): % of population Hispanic (n=72 census tracts), black (n=36), uninsured (n=33), receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (n=39), and living in poverty (n=23). In the adjusted model, factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 were a higher proportion of Hispanic population (aIRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.21-1.28) and households receiving SNAP benefits (aIRR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.13). The distribution of cases varied over time, but with persistently high incidence in communities north of Boston. Conclusion(s): We found a significant association between neighborhood disadvantage measures and high incidence rates of COVID-19. Limitations include case ascertainment challenges due to access to testing and possible selection bias from use of a single health care system. These results suggest that policy makers should consider health inequities as they respond to the ongoing pandemic and plan for future health needs.

{"text": "An outbreak of a new infectious disease COVID-19: beta-coronaviruses as a threat to global healthcare. Coronaviruses are the largest group of known positive-strand RNA viruses. Coronavirus infection can affect various animal species, as well as humans. Over the past two decades, coronaviruses have caused epidemic outbreaks of two respiratory diseases: the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. At the end of 2019, a new type of virus was detected in China. The virus has been spread by humanto- human transmission and has caused a viral pneumonia outbreak. The emergence of a new coronavirus proves that the diseases caused by this group of viruses pose a threat to global health due to the potential for a pandemic, and, therefore, need careful monitoring. The objective of the study was to analyse the current epidemic situation for the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, taking into account previous outbreaks of infections caused by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV beta-coronaviruses which pose the greatest threat to human health. The review briefly describes two epidemic outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV (2002-2004) and MERS-CoV (2012-present), summarises the current epidemic situation for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, describes the main restrictive measures undertaken to prevent the spread of infection in Russia. The paper considers aspects of potential specific therapy and the development of prophylactic vaccines against the new coronavirus infection. The review concludes that SARS-CoV-2 has pandemic potential and that new strains of beta-coronaviruses are likely to cause outbreaks in the future. The paper points to the need for careful monitoring of the disease and conducting preventive anti-epidemic measures to curb the spread of infection.Copyright \u00a9 BIOpreparations.

Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and to characterise immunity to the disease in order to address key knowledge gaps in the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays for IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated their performance using 128 pre-pandemic plasmas (negative controls) and 104 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 5 were asymptomatic, 51 had mild symptoms and 48 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 95.78% at >=14 days and 95.65% at >=21 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.977 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population.

{"text": "Prospective Study Comparing Deep Throat Saliva With Other Respiratory Tract Specimens in the Diagnosis of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019. BACKGROUND: Self-collected specimens have been advocated to avoid infectious exposure to healthcare workers. Self-induced sputum in those with a productive cough and saliva in those without a productive cough have been proposed, but sensitivity remains uncertain. METHOD(S): We performed a prospective study in 2 regional hospitals in Hong Kong. RESULT(S): We prospectively examined 563 serial samples collected during the virus shedding periods of 50 patients: 150 deep throat saliva (DTS), 309 pooled-nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs, and 104 sputum. Deep throat saliva had the lowest overall reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive rate (68.7% vs 89.4% [sputum] and 80.9% [pooled NP and throat swabs]) and the lowest viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration (mean log copy/mL 3.54 vs 5.03 [sputum] and 4.63 [pooled NP and throat swabs]). Analyses with respect to time from symptom onset and severity also revealed similar results. Virus yields of DTS correlated with that of sputum (Pearson correlation index 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.86). We estimated that the overall false-negative rate of DTS could be as high as 31.3% and increased 2.7 times among patients without sputum. CONCLUSION(S): Deep throat saliva produced the lowest viral RNA concentration and RT-PCR-positive rate compared with conventional respiratory specimens in all phases of illness.

{"text": "Potential effects of disruption to HIV programmes in sub-Saharan Africa caused by COVID-19: results from multiple mathematical models. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to disruptions to provision of HIV services for people living with HIV and those at risk of acquiring HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, where UNAIDS estimated that more than two-thirds of the approximately 38 million people living with HIV resided in 2018. We aimed to predict the potential effects of such disruptions on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Method(s): In this modelling study, we used five well described models of HIV epidemics (Goals, Optima HIV, HIV Synthesis, an Imperial College London model, and Epidemiological MODeling software [EMOD]) to estimate the effect of various potential disruptions to HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services on HIV-related deaths and new infections in sub-Saharan Africa lasting 6 months over 1 year from April 1, 2020. We considered scenarios in which disruptions affected 20%, 50%, and 100% of the population. Finding(s): A 6-month interruption of supply of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs across 50% of the population of people living with HIV who are on treatment would be expected to lead to a 1.63 times (median across models; range 1.39-1.87) increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period compared with no disruption. In sub-Saharan Africa, this increase amounts to a median excess of HIV deaths, across all model estimates, of 296 000 (range 229 023-420 000) if such a high level of disruption occurred. Interruption of ART would increase mother-to-child transmission of HIV by approximately 1.6 times. Although an interruption in the supply of ART drugs would have the largest impact of any potential disruptions, effects of poorer clinical care due to overstretched health facilities, interruptions of supply of other drugs such as co-trimoxazole, and suspension of HIV testing would all have a substantial effect on population-level mortality (up to a 1.06 times increase in HIV-related deaths over a 1-year period due to disruptions affecting 50% of the population compared with no disruption). Interruption to condom supplies and peer education would make populations more susceptible to increases in HIV incidence, although physical distancing measures could lead to reductions in risky sexual behaviour (up to 1.19 times increase in new HIV infections over a 1-year period if 50% of people are affected). Interpretation(s): During the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary priority for governments, donors, suppliers, and communities should focus on maintaining uninterrupted supply of ART drugs for people with HIV to avoid additional HIV-related deaths. The provision of other HIV prevention measures is also important to prevent any increase in HIV incidence.

The adopted diagnostic tools lack sensitivity or specificity. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to create an easy-to-get risk score (Ri.S.I.Co., risk score for infection with the new coronavirus) developed on the field to stratify patients admitted to hospitals according to their risk of COVID-19 infection. Method(s): In this prospective study, we included all patients who were consecutively admitted to the suspected COVID-19 department of the Bufalini Hospital, Cesena (Italy). All clinical, radiological, and laboratory predictors were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to create a risk model. A simplified model was internally and externally validated, and two score thresholds for stratifying the probability of COVID-19 infection were introduced. Result(s): From 11th March to 5th April 2020, 200 patients were consecutively admitted. A Ri.S.I.Co lower than 2 showed a higher sensitivity than SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection (96.2% vs. 65.4%; P < 0.001). The presence of ground-glass pattern on the lung-CT scan had a lower sensitivity than a Ri.S.I.Co lower than 2 (88.5% vs. 96.2%; P < 0.001) and a lower specificity than a Ri.S.I.Co higher than 6 (75.0% vs. 96.9%; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): We believe that the Ri.S.I.Co could allow to stratify admitted patients according to their risk, preventing hospitals from becoming the main COVID-19 carriers themselves.

A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. RESULT(S): The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. 10 of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviours included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min +/- 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 days and 20.9 days to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). CONCLUSION(S): Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and treated effluents: Surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic in the United Arab Emirates. Testing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in wastewater has recently emerged as a method of tracking the prevalence of the virus and an early-warning tool for predicting outbreaks in the future. This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater influents and treated effluents of 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as untreated wastewater from 38 various locations, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May and June 2020. Composite samples collected over twenty-four hours were thermally deactivated for safety, followed by viral concentration using ultrafiltration, RNA extraction using commercially available kits, and viral quantification using RT-qPCR. Furthermore, estimates of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different regions were simulated using Monte Carlo. Results showed that the viral load in wastewater influents from these WWTPs ranged from 7.50E+02 to over 3.40E+04 viral gene copies/L with some plants having no detectable viral RNA by RT-qPCR. The virus was also detected in 85% of untreated wastewater samples taken from different locations across the country, with viral loads in positive samples ranging between 2.86E+02 and over 2.90E+04 gene copies/L. It was also observed that the precautionary measures implemented by the UAE government correlated with a drop in the measured viral load in wastewater samples, which were in line with the reduction of COVID-19 cases reported in the population. Importantly, none of the 11 WWTPs' effluents tested positive during the entire sampling period, indicating that the treatment technologies used in the UAE are efficient in degrading SARS-CoV-2, and confirming the safety of treated re-used water in the country. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater testing has the potential to aid in monitoring or predicting an outbreak location and can shed light on the extent viral spread at the community level.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

This study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and assessed mental illness via an online survey among healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Central Hospital of Wuhan after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. PTSD symptoms were measured using the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C), with a cutoff score of 50. Among the 642 HCWs, the prevalence of probable PTSD was 20.87%. Additionally, 88.88%, 82.09%, 100%, and 95.52% of HCWs with probable PTSD reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and insomnia, respectively. HCWs with probable PTSD scored higher on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) than non-PTSD HCWs (all p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HCWs with negative COVID-19 tests (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21-0.58; p < 0.00), those with high Social Support Self-Rating Scale (SSRS) scores (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.52; p < 0.00), and HCWs whose family members tested negative (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.96; p = 0.03) were less likely to have probable PTSD.

PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on general surgical emergencies as well as analyzing the effectiveness of measures taken in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and healthcare professionals. METHOD(S): Patients who underwent emergency surgery between the pandemic period of March 14th to May 15th 2020 and within the same period from the previous year were reviewed retrospectively. COVID-19 incidence in patients and health professionals working in the general surgery department during these periods was questioned. RESULT(S): Demographic data were similar between the two time periods. The number of patients who underwent surgery in the pandemic group (n=103) was lower than the control group (n=252). There was a 59.1% reduction in emergency surgeries. The biggest decreases were the admissions of incarcerated hernia, uncomplicated appendicitis and acute cholecystitis (92%, 81.3%, 47.3%, respectively). During the pandemic, an increase was of patient rates who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis and AMIO (p=0.001, p=0.019, respectively). The rate of mortality was higher in patients who underwent emergency surgery during pandemic (p=0.049). The results of COVID-19 screening were positive in 6 (6/103, 5.82%) patients undergoing emergency surgery. None of the doctors working in the ward were infected with COVID-19 infection (0/20).

Background: Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are caused by coronaviruses and have infected people in China and worldwide. We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at provincial level in mainland China. Method(s): The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Result(s): Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher overall incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China; the highest RR = 135.08, 95% CI: 128.36-142.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China; the highest RR = 423.51, 95% CI: 240.96-722.32) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the \"Wuhan lockdown\". The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS. Conclusion(s): COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks exhibited distinct spatiotemporal clustering patterns at the provincial levels in mainland China, which may be attributable to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Past and current biological factors affecting malaria in the low transmission setting of Botswana: A review. Malaria continues to be one of the top infectious agents contributing to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana. It also postulates that a comprehensive understanding of these aforementioned biological factors may help to explain malaria persistence in Botswana.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Involving Residents Receiving Dialysis in a Nursing Home - Maryland, April 2020. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly in nursing homes once it is introduced (1,2). To prevent outbreaks, more data are needed to identify sources of introduction and means of transmission within nursing homes. Nursing home residents who receive hemodialysis (dialysis) might be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections because of their frequent exposures outside the nursing home to both community dialysis patients and staff members at dialysis centers (3). Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Maryland nursing home (facility A) identified a higher prevalence of infection among residents undergoing dialysis (47%; 15 of 32) than among those not receiving dialysis (16%; 22 of 138) (p<0.001). Among residents with COVID-19, the 30-day hospitalization rate among those receiving dialysis (53%) was higher than that among residents not receiving dialysis (18%) (p = 0.03); the proportion of dialysis patients who died was 40% compared with those who did not receive dialysis (27%) (p = 0.42).Careful consideration of infection control practices throughout the dialysis process (e.g., transportation, time spent in waiting areas, spacing of machines, and cohorting), clear communication between nursing homes and dialysis centers, and coordination of testing practices between these sites are critical to preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in this medically vulnerable population.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019-COVID-19. In recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated pre-dominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "A pilot study on the preventative potential of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemics. This virus attacks the cells by binding to the transmembrane angiotensin I converting enzyme 2. In this study, we experimented a food supplement containing alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol for the improvement of the defenses against the SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxytyrosol has anti-viral properties and is able to reduce the serum lipids in mice. alpha-cyclodextrin has the ability to deplete sphingolipids and phospholipids from the cellular membranes. The aim of the present preliminary open non-controlled interventional study was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2., METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from Northern Cyprus and six positive individuals for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. The in silico prediction was performed using D3DOCKING to evaluate the interactions of hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis., RESULTS: The 50 volunteers did not become positive in 15 days for SARS-CoV-2 after the administration of the compound for two weeks, despite they were at higher risk of infection than the general population. Interestingly, in the cohort of six positive patients, two patients were administered the spray and became negative after five days, despite the viral load was higher in the treated subjects than the untreated patients who became negative after ten days. In addition, we identified possible interactions among hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with the protein Spike and the human proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2., CONCLUSIONS: We reported on the results of the possible role of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. The next step will be the administration of the compound to a larger cohort in a controlled study to confirm the reduction of the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the treated subjects.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2. Estimating the size and infection severity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is made challenging by inconsistencies in available data. The number of COVID-19 deaths is often used as a key indicator for the epidemic size, but observed deaths represent only a minority of all infections1,2. Additionally, the heterogeneous burden in nursing homes and variable reporting of deaths in elderly individuals can hamper direct comparisons across countries of the underlying level of transmission and mortality rates3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19 death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (<65 years) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how this data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection-to-fatality ratio (IFR) is lowest among 5-9 years old, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age-structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection-fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by the 1st of September 2020, with much higher transmission likely to have occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied wherever reliable age-specific death data exists.Copyright \u00a9 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

Background: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with or develop cerebrovascular disease during the course of hospitalization. Whereas ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients has been well described, data on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients. Method(s): A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and August 14, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify eligible studies. Result(s): A total of 23 studies describing ICH in 148 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of ICH in COVID-19 patients was 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-0.9), with low levels of inter-study heterogeneity observed (I2 = 33.6%, Cochran's Q = 12.05, p = 0.149). Most of the patients were elderly male patients (65.8%) with comorbidities, the most common being systemic hypertension (54%). Hemorrhage involving multiple cranial compartments was reported in 9.5% of cases. Single compartments were involved in the rest, with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) being the most common variety (62.6%) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) the least common (1.4%). Half of these patients were on some form of anticoagulation. Overall, the mortality rate in the COVID-19 patients with ICH was about 48.6%. Conclusion(s): Although relatively uncommon among COVID-19 patients, ICH is associated with a high mortality rate.

Background COVID-19 infection is characterised, among other features, by a prothrombotic state with high rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE), D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels. Clinical observations have also highlighted that these patients have elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIIIc. Methods 24 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients were selected from the intensive care unit (ICU) or the high acuity ward of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. Results The rate of VTE was 25% and mortality rate was 16.7%. Fibrinogen and D-Dimers were elevated, 7.9 (1.6) g/L and 2.4 (2.02) ug/ml respectively. Factor VIIIc and von vWF antigen levels were both extremely elevated at 279 (148) u/dL and 350 (131) % respectively, which are comparable to levels seen in ICU patients with severe sepsis. vWF levels were significantly higher in patients that died (p=0.017) and showed a positive correlation with age. There was a statistically significant association between COVID-19 disease and non-O blood group (p=0.02); 80% (4/5) of COVID-19 patients with VTE were blood group A. Conclusion Very high levels of vWF and factor VIIIc are common in COVID-19 patients, comparable to levels in severely septic non-COVID ICU patients. This could contribute to the hypercoagulable state and increased VTE rate in COVID-19.

{"text": "May 2020: Is It Always COVID-19 No Matter What?. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a massive outbreak throughout the world. In this period, diseases other than coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have not disappeared; however, it is hard for doctors to diagnose diseases that can mimic the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of COVID-19, especially rare lung diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). We report the clinical case of a young patient who presented to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and clinical symptoms, radiological aspects, and blood tests compatible with COVID-19; two swabs and a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 were performed, both resulted negative, but the respiratory failure worsened. Peripheral eosinophilia guided us to consider the possibility of a rare disease such as AEP, even if radiology findings were not pathognomonic. Therefore, we decided to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the lingula, which showed the presence of eosinophilia greater than 40%.

Data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in rural communities is scarce or non-existent. A previous cross-sectional study in middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort demonstrated that 45% of participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 77% of whom were symptomatic. Here, we assessed the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the above-mentioned rural population. One month after baseline testing, 362 of 370 initially seronegative individuals were re-tested to assess incidence of seroconversion and associated risk factors. Twenty-eight of them (7.7%) became seropositive. The overall incidence rate ratio was 7.4 per 100 person months of potential virus exposure (95% C.I.: 4.7-10.2). Six seroconverted individuals (21.4%) developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptomatology. The only covariate significantly associated with seroconversion was the use of an open latrine. Predictive margins showed that these individuals were 2.5 times more likely to be infected (95% C.I.: 1.03-6.1) than those using a flushing toilet. Therefore, along one month, approximately 8% of seronegative individuals became infected, even after almost half of the population was already seropositive. Nevertheless, a smaller proportion of incident cases were symptomatic (21% versus 77% of the earlier cases), and no deaths were recorded. Whether this decreased clinical expression resulted from a lower viral load in new infections cannot be determined. Increased seroconversion in individuals using latrines is consistent with a contributory role of fecal-oral transmission, although we cannot rule out the possibility that latrines are acting as a proxy for poverty or other unknown interacting variables.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The aims of this study were to investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; and to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow.

Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples, respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories.

{"text": "The Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Background: Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies has become an important tool, complementing nucleic acid tests (NATs) for diagnosis and for determining the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in population serosurveys. The magnitude and persistence of antibody responses are critical for assessing the duration of immunity., Methods: A SARS-CoV-2-specific immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was developed and prospectively evaluated by comparison to the reference standard of NAT on respiratory tract samples from individuals with suspected COVID-19. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured in a subset of samples using a standard microneutralization assay., Results: A total of 2753 individuals were eligible for the study (126 NAT-positive; prevalence, 4.6%). The median \"window period\" from illness onset to appearance of antibodies (range) was 10.2 (5.8-14.4) days. The sensitivity and specificity of either SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, or IgM when collected >=14 days after symptom onset were 91.3% (95% CI, 84.9%-95.6%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.3%), respectively. The negative predictive value was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.8%). The positive predictive value of detecting any antibody class was 79.9% (95% CI, 73.3%-85.1%); this increased to 96.8% (95% CI, 90.7%-99.0%) for the combination of IgG and IgA., Conclusions: Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody by IFA is an accurate method to diagnose COVID-19. Serological testing should be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify additional cases where NAT was not performed and resolve cases where false-negative and false-positive NATs are suspected.

Due to the sparsity of data, the estimation of confidence interval is a big challenge. Thus, we consider several confidence intervals using Asymptotic, Exact and Bayesian estimation methods. In this article, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all Asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all Exact methods and Jeffrey's method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method.

{"text": "Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for controlling COVID- 19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicenter or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR, it extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-ExposedInfectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Without taking this intervention, we predict the number of infections would have been 73 folders higher by the middle of April 2020. Its success requires efficient government initiatives and effective collaborative governance for mobilizing of corporate resources to provide essential goods. This mode may be not suitable to other countries without efficient collaborative governance and sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. This finding has been recently confirmed by other studies that the seroprevalence in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different sub-regions. It highlights that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of herd immunity. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Yang et al.

However, the mechanism by which the pathogen affects children is not understood completely. Children so far accounted for only1 to 6.4% of diagnosed cases and the mortality rate is also less. Though clinical findings are similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, fewer numbers of children appear to develop severe pneumonia. Observed attenuated response to the virus may possibly be due to decrease in the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lungs, repeated viral exposure, and not having any underlying chronic diseases or immunosuppression. Suggested treatment included oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation in severe cases, nutritional support, and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. Although, no definitive pharmacological therapy is available, various combination of drugs like hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and convalescent serum show promising result to an extent. As there is no specific therapeutic measure for this ailment, aggressive efforts are being made to develop a potential vaccine against the disease.

BACKGROUND: Ever since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has had a devastating effect on the world through exponential case growth and death tolls in at least 146 countries. Rapid response and timely modifications in the emergency department (ED) for infection control are paramount to maintaining basic medical services and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This study presents the unique measure of combining a fever screening station (FSS) and graded approach to isolation and testing in a Taiwanese medical center., METHODS: An FSS was immediately set up outside the ED on January 27, 2019. A graded approach was adopted to stratify patients into \"high risk,\" \"intermediate risk,\" and \"undetermined risk\" for both isolation and testing., RESULTS: A total of 3755 patients were screened at the FSS, with 80.3% visiting the ED from home, 70.9% having no travel history, 21.4% having traveled to Asia, and 10.0% of TVGH staff. Further, 54.9% had fever, 35.5% had respiratory symptoms, 3.2% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 0.6% experienced loss of smell, and 3.1% had no symptoms; 81.3% were discharged, 18.6% admitted, and 0.1% died.

The magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic found health systems unprepared, not allowing for prompt evaluation, collaboration among specialities and treatment of severely ill patients admitted to intensive care units, with many of them having an unfortunate outcome. Current data demonstrate an acute immune dysregulation in severe forms of the disease. The above is concluded by clinical evolution and laboratory findings, indicating a severe inflammatory response of the innate immune system, initiating predominately with the involvement of the respiratory tract epithelial cells, occasionally progressing to thrombotic diathesis and related complications. Besides the clinical manifestations, the immune response expresses an extremely high acute phase reactants repertoire including hyperferritinemia, hyper-fibrinogenaemia, and a storm of cytokines that require an alternative view and collaboration with rheumatologists. Thrombotic diathesis in some cases may not attribute only to a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation, but also to an additional activation of adaptive immunity and the development of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Unifying speciality evaluation and treatment may improve patient outcomes by recognizing early the evolving syndromes, treating properly, in a stratifying manner, with medications that alleviate the inflammatory reaction. Corticosteroids, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and possibly potent immunosuppressants are in the armamentarium. Additionally, biologics that interrupt the innate immune dysfunction, such as IL-1, IL-6 and selective JAK inhibitors, are also used. Convalescent plasma therapy and human immunoglobulin may be restricted for those whom the proposed treatments are found inadequate.

Moreover, using an artificial intelligence tool we performed an automatic segmentation on CT images based on Hounsfield unit to calculate residual healthy lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and emphysema volumes for both right and left lungs. Two expert radiologists, in consensus, attributed at the CT pulmonary disease involvement a severity score using a scale of 5 levels; the score was attributed for GGO and consolidation for each lung, and then, an overall radiological severity visual score was obtained summing the single score. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed., RESULTS: Symptoms and comorbidities did not show differences statistically significant in terms of patient outcome. Instead, SpO2 was significantly lower in patients hospitalized in critical conditions or died while age, HS CRP, leukocyte count, neutrophils, LDH, d-dimer, troponin, creatinine and azotemia, ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher.

Consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma volumes showed statistically significant differences in the three groups of patients based on outcome (patients discharged at home, patients hospitalized in stable conditions and patient hospitalized in critical conditions or died) while GGO volume did not affect the patient's outcome. Moreover, the overall radiological severity visual score (cutoff >= 8) was a predictor of patient outcome. The highest value of R-squared (R2 = 0.93) was obtained by the model that combines clinical/laboratory findings at CT volumes. The highest accuracy was obtained by clinical/laboratory and CT findings model with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively, of 88%, 78% and 81% to predict discharged/stable patients versus critical/died patients., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both CT visual score and computerized software-based quantification of the consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma on chest CT images were independent predictors of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "High mortality among hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer: A multicentre observational cohort study. Introduction: Studies suggest that patients with cancer are more likely to experience severe outcomes from COVID-19. Therefore, cancer centres have undertaken efforts to care for patients with cancer in COVID-free units. Nevertheless, the frequency and relevance of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 in patients with cancer remain unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in this population and identify predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. Method(s): Patients with cancer and a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were prospectively identified using provincial registries and hospital databases between March 3rd and May 23rd, 2020 in the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia in Canada. Patient's baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type and type of anticancer treatment were collected. The exposure of interest was incidence of hospital-acquired infection defined by diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 >= 5 days after hospital admission for COVID-unrelated cause. Co-primary outcomes were death or composite outcomes of severe illness from COVID-19 such as hospitalisation, supplemental oxygen, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. Result(s): A total of 252 patients (N = 249 adult and N = 3 paediatric) with COVID-19 and cancer were identified, and the majority were residents of Quebec (N = 233). One hundred and six patients (42.1%) received active anticancer treatment in the last 3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis. During a median follow-up of 25 days, 33 (13.1%) required admission to the ICU, and 71 (28.2%) died. Forty-seven (19.1%) had a diagnosis of hospital-acquired COVID-19. Median overall survival was shorter in those with hospital-acquired infection than that in a contemporary community-acquired population (27 days versus unreached, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.4, p = 0.0006. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that hospital-acquired COVID-19, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status and advanced stage of cancer were independently associated with death. Interpretation(s): Our study demonstrates a high rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19, associated with increased mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the cancer population, reinforcing the importance of treating patients with cancer in COVID-free units. We also validated that age and advanced cancer were negative predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Estimating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on services provided by Italian Neuromuscular Centers: an Italian Association of Myology survey of the acute phase. Introduction. Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy has forced the health care system to undergo profound rearrangements in its services and facilities, especially in the worst-hit areas in Northern Italy. In this setting, inpatient and outpatient services had to rethink and reorganize their activities to meet the needs of patients during the \"lockdown\". The Italian Association of Myology developed a survey to estimate the impact of these changes on patients affected by neuromuscular disorders and on specialized neuromuscular centers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. We developed an electronic survey that was sent to neuromuscular centers affiliated with the Italian Association of Myology, assessing changes in pharmacological therapies provision, outpatient clinical and instrumental services, support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) and clinical trials. Results. 40% of surveyed neuromuscular centers reported a reduction in outpatient visit and examinations (44.5% of centers in Northern regions; 25% of centers in Central regions; 50% of centers in Southern regions). Twenty-two% of centers postponed in-hospital administration of therapies for neuromuscular diseases (23.4% in Northern regions; 13.0% in Central regions; 20% in Southern regions). Diagnostic and support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) were suspended in 57% of centers (66/43/44% in Northern, Central and Southern centers respectively) Overall, the most affected services were rehabilitative services and on-site outpatient visits, which were suspended in 93% of centers. Strategies adopted by neuromuscular centers to overcome these changes included maintaining urgent on-site visits, addressing patients to available services and promoting remote contact and telemedicine. Conclusions. Overall, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant disruption of clinical and support services for patients with neuromuscular diseases. Despite the efforts to provide telemedicine consults to patients, this option could be promoted and improved further. A close collaboration between the different neuromuscular centers and service providers as well as further implementation of telehealth platforms are necessary to ensure quality care to NMD patients in the near future and in case of recurrent pandemic waves.Copyright \u00a9 Gaetano Conte Academy - Mediterranean Society of Myology", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic. The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (n = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (OR = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.

{"text": "Impact of COVID-19-Related Lockdown on Psychosocial, Cognitive, and Functional Well-Being in Adults With Down Syndrome. People with Down Syndrome (DS) have a high prevalence of physical and psychiatric comorbidities and experience early-onset dementia. With the outbreak of CoVID-19 pandemic, strict social isolation measures have been necessary to prevent the spreading of the disease. Effects of this lockdown period on behavior, mood and cognition in people with DS have not been assessed so far. In the present clinical study, we investigated the impact of CoVID-19-related lockdown on psychosocial, cognitive and functional well-being in a sample population of 46 adults with DS. The interRAI Intellectual Disability standardized assessment instrument, which includes measures of social withdrawal, functional impairment, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, was used to perform a three time-point evaluation (two pre-lockdown and one post-lockdown) in 37 subjects of the study sample, and a two time point evaluation (one pre- and one post-lockdown) in 9 subjects. Two mixed linear regression models - one before and one after the lockdown - have been fitted for each scale in order to investigate the change in the time-dependent variation of the scores. In the pre-lockdown period, significant worsening over time (i.e., per year) was found for the Depression Rating Scale score (beta = 0.55; 95% CI 0.34; 0.76). In the post-lockdown period, a significant worsening in social withdrawal (beta = 3.05, 95% CI 0.39; 5.70), instrumental activities of daily living (beta = 1.13, 95% CI 0.08; 2.18) and depression rating (beta = 1.65, 95% CI 0.33; 2.97) scales scores was observed, as was a significant improvement in aggressive behavior (beta = -1.40, 95% CI -2.69; -0.10). Despite the undoubtful importance of the lockdown in order to reduce the spreading of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the related social isolation measures suggest an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a worsening in functional status in a sample of adults with DS. At the opposite, aggressive behavior was reduced after the lockdown period. This finding could be related to the increase of negative and depressive symptoms in the study population. Studies with longer follow-up period are needed to assess persistence of these effects.

{"text": "Modeling return of the epidemic: Impact of population structure, asymptomatic infection, case importation and personal contacts. Background: Proactive interventions have halted the pandemic of coronavirus infected disease in some regions. However, without reaching herd immunity, the return of epidemic is possible. We investigate the impact of population structure, case importation, asymptomatic cases, and the number of contacts on a possible second wave of epidemic through mathematical modeling. Method(s): we built a modified Susceptible-exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model with parameters mirroring those of the COVID-19 pandemic and reported simulated characteristics of epidemics for incidence, hospitalizations and deaths under different scenarios. Result(s): A larger percent of elderly people leads to higher number of hospitalizations, while a large percent of prior infection will effectively curb the epidemic. The number of imported cases and the speed of importation have small impact on the epidemic progression. However, a higher percent of asymptomatic cases slows the epidemic down and reduces the number of hospitalizations and deaths at the epidemic peak. Finally, reducing the number of contacts among young people alone has moderate effects on themselves, but little effects on the elderly population. However, reducing the number of contacts among elderly people alone can mitigate the epidemic significantly in both age groups, even though young people remain active within themselves. Conclusion(s): Reducing the number of contacts among high risk populations alone can mitigate the burden of epidemic in the whole society. Interventions targeting high risk groups may be more effective in containing or mitigating the epidemic.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}

The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, has reached Mexico and has brought serious consequences for the general population; a large number of sick people and a considerable number of deaths. Every day, a large number of academic writings are produced that bring case reports and treatment proposals; however, despite these great efforts, from the experience acquired in other countries, the information is still uncertain regarding any treatment that is effective to stop the advance of the pandemic. From these reports we have very valuable data, one of the most relevant is that the most affected people and in greater magnitude in terms of severity are older adults, and even more so if these people have comorbidity with chronic diseases of higher prevalence in our country: hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity, conditions that are particularly frequent among older Mexican adults. It is known that this age group has its own changes of aging and atypical forms of manifestation of the disease, as well as in the case of hospitalization, they require finer and constant care for the recovery of health; so, a review and consensus of existing information to offer these recommendations was made for the comprehensive care of older adults with COVID-19.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Comunicaciones Cientificas Mexicanas S.A. de C.V..

{"text": "Evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response in outpatients by five commercial immunoassays. Commercially available immunoassays have been developed for sensitive and specific detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. While high sensitivity has been reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, little is known about the performance of the assays in ambulatory patients. Therefore, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response in 51 SASR-CoV-2-PCR-confirmed outpatients with five commercial immunoassays. The sensitivity in serum samples, collected at a median of 24 days after onset of symptoms, detected by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG (Euroimmun), EDI TM Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA (Epitope Diagnostics), Liaison R SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (Diasorin), SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the Architect TM i2000 (Abbott), and Elecsys R Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgM/IgA/IgG) on the cobas TM e801 (Roche) was 84.3%, 78.4%, 74.5%, 86.3%, and 88.2%, respectively. The sensitivity in serum samples, collected >20 days after onset of symptoms, varied between 75.0% and 90.0%, and in samples, collected at least 28 days after onset of symptoms, did not increase, except in the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG by Euroimmun (90.0%). There was not an obvious association between the type of the antigen (N versus S protein) and the overall sensitivity of the assays. Our results show significant individual differences of the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2, additionally confirmed in three patients with follow-up serum samples and seven asymptomatic but PCR-positive contact persons. In conclusion, our study shows that commercially available immunoassays detect SARS-CoV-2-IgG or total antibodies in outpatients with a satisfying sensitivity, but lower than that reported for hospitalized patients. In asymptomatic persons the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response may even be absent in a relevant percentage of persons. Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wellinghausen et al.", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Enhanced elicitation of potent neutralizing antibodies by the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain Fc fusion protein in mice. The development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We generated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc fusion protein and evaluated its potency to elicit neutralizing antibody response in mice. RBD-Fc elicited a higher neutralizing antibodies titer than RBD as evaluated by a pseudovirus neutralization assay and a live virus based microneutralization assay. Furthermore, RBD-Fc immunized sera better inhibited cell-cell fusion, as evaluated by a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay. The cell-cell fusion assay results correlated well with the virus neutralization potency and could be used for high-throughput screening of large panels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and vaccines without the requirement of live virus infection in BSL3 containment. Moreover, the anti-RBD sera did not enhance the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection of K562 cells. These results demonstrate that Fc fusion can significantly improve the humoral immune response to recombinant RBD immunogen, and suggest that RBD-Fc could serve as a useful component of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)", "label": "excluded", "metadata": ""}
{"text": "Antiviral therapies: advances and perspectives. Viral infections cause high morbidity and mortality, threaten public health, and impose a socioeconomic burden. We have seen the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19 that has already infected more than 29 million people, with more than 900,000 deaths since its identification in December 2019. Considering the significant impact of viral infections, research and development of new antivirals and control strategies are essential. In this paper, we summarise 96 antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1987 and 2019. Of these, 49 (51%) are used in treatments against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 4 against human papilloma virus (HPV), 6 against cytomegalovirus (CMV), 8 against hepatitis B virus (HBV), 5 against influenza, 6 against herpes simplex virus (HSV), 17 against hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 1 against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This review also describes future perspectives for new antiviral therapies such as nanotechnologies, monoclonal antibodies, and the CRISPR-Cas system. These strategies are suggested as inhibitors of viral replication by various means, such as direct binding to the viral particle, blocking the infection, changes in intracellular mechanisms or viral genes, preventing replication and virion formation. We also observed that a large number of viral agents have no therapy available and the majority of those approved in the last 32 years are restricted to some groups, especially anti-HIV. Additionally, the emergence of new viruses and strains resistant to available antivirals has necessitated the formulation of new antivirals. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

{"text": "Emergency management and internal audit of emergency preparedness of pre-hospital emergency care. One of the negative components of international travel is the higher likelihood of emergencies that affect a large number of people (mass negative impact on health), for example the transmission of infectious diseases, as e.g. SARS CoV-2 pandemic. The frequency and sources of mass-casualty incidents are currently changing dynamically, especially with the onset of terrorist attacks and large-scale natural disasters. Health services and emergency medical service (EMS) take part in addressing these emergencies. For this reason, this paper deals with the EMS emergency preparedness in the Czech Republic for an emergency events with a large number of affected people. EMS in the Czech Republic are not provided by the state but by individual regions. EMS in the Czech Republic do not have central management, nor do they use uniform data documentation. The investigation of the current situation has shown that the attitudes of EMS in individual regions of the Czech Republic to the tasks of emergency preparedness for mass casualty incidents are not identical. The current method of evaluating improvements in the quality of EMS emergency preparedness lacks consistency and is not comprehensively supervised. To tackle this, the paper presents an internal audit methodology for assessing the level of emergency preparedness of the emergency medical services. The authors therefore defined the decisive criteria and indicators assessing the quality level of EMS emergency preparedness at major disaster with multiple victim incident. When developing the methodological procedure of the preparedness evaluation, an algorithm was chosen, based on the gradual verification of the evaluation criteria and indicators by an expert group. Some findings and recommendations based on a research carried out in EMS in individual regions of the Czech Republic are presented.
